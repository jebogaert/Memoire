Title : Tea Party Favorite Becomes Sole African-American in Senate
 
Original : 
Freshman Republican Rep. Tim Scott is poised to become the only black senator and the first from the South since Reconstruction.
Gov. Nikki Haley announced announced on Monday that Scott, who has received strong backing from the Tea Party, will take over retiring Jim DeMint's Senate seat.
DeMint announced earlier this month that he plans to retire in January to lead the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington. Scott will serve until special elections are held in 2014, when voters will decide whether he should serve his remaining term in office.
Scott has been dubbed a Republican rising star. When he was first elected in November 2010, he became the first black Republican in Congress since 2003, and the first black Republican from the South since 1901, according to an ABC News report.
"In fact, while Scott's appointment is largely being billed as a historic development for the South in general and the GOP in specific, it also is quite noteworthy for the nation as a whole. Scott will soon become the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate, and just the seventh ever black senator from any region of the country,"¬ù according to Slate.
A 2014 victory would be even more significant, Slate reports, since it would make him the first black senator representing the state who was elected directly by voters.

Joe Manchin, the Democratic Senate candidate in West Virginia, has built a substantial lead in the bank, and the state is not terribly deep in debt. According to Politico, Manchin is raising $1.1 million so far, placing him well ahead of three other Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Jim Webb of Virginia.
But Manchin has received support from all three national parties, and that hasn't stopped Obama's campaign from choosing to launch a banner campaign around the West Virginia seat, which has been held by Democratic incumbent Richard Lugar since the last presidential election in 2006. Campaign officials said Obama would use state business to cast an administration candidate as an "experienced candidate" who can "address the root causes of the economic crisis" and "combat the persistent and broad-based threat of global terrorism."
In 2008, Richard Lugar was Lugar's opponent. In 2000, Dan Quayle was a Democrat; in 1993, Rudy Giuliani picked up a nomination nomination. That's why the state has become a heartbeat away from the Obama campaign, after the outbound "Hey, grab the fundraiser" campaign before the election.
The state's Democratic establishment could benefit in 2014 if the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama, succeeds in capturing the seat, a trend that has been kicking around since Democrats established a pick-up in 2010. If the Democratic nominee wins, the seat is traditionally held by a Republican, and if Manchin unseats the incumbent in 2014, the seat won't be lost for Senate Democrats. "Republicans need our support," said Joe Manchin's campaign manager, Sam Otting. "That's what's happening in West Virginia."
Republicans see a message that has come in handy since the Obama campaign began pulling out of West Virginia, which largely favors whomever their nominee is. (The state is so close to Obama that both are running in his vice-presidential campaign for the second time.) Most of that state is under the control of Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak. Another reason Sestak's campaign is getting bigger is that it's airing an ad that portrays Obama as insufficiently conservative. According to Nate Silver, who analyzes the spread of non-traditional advertising, the ad got more than 1 million views on YouTube and Twitter, which gives Obama an eight-digit lead on the Democrats. But it can't save Romney's campaign from losing to Democrat Andy Barr in the Senate's new district, which is turning yellow. So far, Obama is ahead in West Virginia, but his polling edge is among the highest in the state. "Obama is ahead, but his poll numbers are also very similar to that of the District," said David Remnick, of National Review. "Then there's another, more insidious twist: I think with a complete electorate under 50 percent, Republican ads can hurt the president enormously."
The change in strategy, which has included getting out enough people to get Obama to South Bend, can also hurt Republicans, who have been run out of the area in the last couple of weeks. It's less certain that the kind of ads targeting Obama will stick in the state. Lovie Huckabee, the tea party's chief strategist and now the owner of a new restaurant in the district, said he worried that Lugar's support might shift to Obama and make sure "the president won't show up to the South Bend rally in October or November. Lugar has already done that, and he's certainly trying that." A Lugar win could transform the seat.

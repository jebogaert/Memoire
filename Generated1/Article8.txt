Title : Microsoft slashes Xbox and Surface prices for Black Friday
 
Original : 
Some giant tech companies feel inclined to throw their fans a bone by discounting a few of their biggest products for the holiday season. It's a nice gesture that boosts goodwill and loyalty, along with sales.
Because other companies ... just don't do discounts. Ever. You know who we're talking about.
In the former group is Microsoft, which recently unveiled its Black Friday sales on the online Microsoft Store. You're not going to see any promotions on the exciting new hardware that was announced at the Windows event last month (some of that stuff doesn't even ship until 2017 anyway), but there are some pretty good deals on the Surface line, Xbox gear and the PC-compatible VR headsets that will keep the Bill Gates fanboy in your life very happy this holiday season.
Check them out below, and take note of the starting date â€” sale prices generally go into effect on Nov. 24, but some go online as early as Nov. 18.

BONUS: Getting to know the Surface Book, Microsoft's first laptop

Generated : 
After dropping prices on many of its biggest products this weekend, Microsoft is letting its Surface line of high-end desktops and laptops stand idle while it auctions off more Surface Pro and Surface Pro X computers.
Microsoft's team already shows up late Monday afternoon at its North American showroom in San Francisco, meaning prices for Xbox, Surface and Surface line of desktops, laptops and iPads will be the same Monday morning. This puts an end to an expected frenzy of tablet and ultrabook bundle sales that appeared like a fit for a gothic fairytale story, but were actually planned on closing on Thanksgiving.
Before you go any further, though, we do urge you to keep the Surface line in mind. The purple tablets are fairly inexpensive, yet are basically the size of an USB stick. If you're not too fond of the Surface Pro or other Surface laptops, you can always put the price down on a recent Ivy Bridge PC, which should be cheaper and less difficult to find than what you're getting on Amazon.
We urge you to save some money on your black Friday and new Black Friday deals.
Microsoft has plans to close certain sections of its tech store. I'm expecting more Black Friday deals.

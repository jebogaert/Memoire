We’ve previously covered the best-selling, fastest-selling, and most elaborate on Thanksgiving! With Black Friday (which is now in its 17th year) not only shaping up to be one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year, but marketers are hoping to outperform at least one other event: Super Bowl LI.
Last year, J.Crew and Banana Republic rolled out these slick war chest free-dress campaigns as well as brand-new holiday line inspired by the monochromatic image of Black Friday, and it looks like 2015 is a bit different this year. The 2014 collection featured exquisite dark pinks and white playsuits designed by Daniel Wiedenhorst and beaded skirt jackets, which The Daily Beast broke recently, and spread through mailboxes and public spaces throughout Atlanta. Now, its latest campaign, Home Essentials, helps its fashion houses celebrate Black Friday ahead of the big game.
Home Essentials will debut as part of Ulta’s Black Friday launch this Friday, November 26. While a limited availability is available, the multi-edition collection features a selection of garments, including that of the actress Scarlett Johansson, who accompanied Atlanta consumers to the game. In May, home Essentials launched; it adds to the collection already released on Target.com this past fall.
While merchandise trends, apparel, and beauty brands are traditionally on our list of the best deals, online retailers do offer some solid deals, but we like to look at their reveals rather than their designs. So, here are the best-selling Black Friday sales from over the past five years.

{{Updated\nNovember turned out to be an \"above average\" month for retailers, as shoppers brought forward their Christmas spending.\nKey points: Retail sales lifted 0.4pc in November, which is a 2.8pc gain since last year\nOnline sales were 6.6pc of total retail turnover during the month\nEconomists forecast a drop in consumer spending, and weaker Christmas sales results\nRetail sales rose 0.4 per cent to $27.1 billion during the month, seasonally adjusted, which coincides with the much-hyped Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.\nIt was a slightly better-than-expected outcome, as Reuters-polled economists had predicted a 0.3 per cent rise in the official Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures.\nThis brings retail sales growth to about 2.8 per cent in the past year, which analysts consider to be a lacklustre result.\n\"Household goods retailing (1.2pc) led the rises, while there was also a notable rise for clothing, footwear and personal accessories retailing (1.5pc),\" said Ben Faulkner, acting director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys at the ABS.\n\"Both of these industries were impacted by strong promotional activity in the November month, including Black Friday sales.\"\nMr Faulkner said there were also slight increases for food retailing (0.2pc) and department stores (0.4pc), but declines for restaurant and takeaway services (-0.1pc).\nThe ABS observed the increases in November retail spending occurred in the Australian Capital Territory (1.6pc), New South Wales (0.8pc), Western Australian (0.6pc), Queensland (0.4pc) and Victoria (0.1pc), seasonally adjusted.\nOn the flipside, consumers cut back on shopping in the Northern Territory (-0.9pc), and Tasmania (-0.2pc), while spending in South Australia was practically unchanged.\nOnline continues to surge\nAs expected, there was a significant rise in online sales, contributing 6.6 per cent to total retail turnover in November.\nThe ABS noted that it was \"highest level\" of online retail sales figures it had ever collected.\nIt was certainly a significant jump compared to the same period last year (November 2017), when online sales were 5.5 per cent of total turnover.\n\"The value of online sales of electronic equipment over the four days from the US-inspired Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales was 205 per cent above the typical November daily spend,\" Commonwealth Bank chief economist Michael Blythe wrote in a note.\n\"On the same basis, clothing and footwear sales were up by 127 per cent, and furniture sales were up by 77 per cent.\"\nDecember payback for November purchases?\nHowever, strong November results means next month's figures, which includes pre-Christmas and Boxing Day sales, could be disappointing.\nIn recent years, there has been a rapidly growing trend for shoppers to do more of their shopping in November.\nData from the Commonwealth Bank's records of its customers' credit card usage shows sales across November, December and early January were considerably down on last year.\n\"The Christmas trading period looks to have been disappointing,\" Mr Blythe said.\n\"The cumulative dollar value of the Christmas spend in November, December and the early part of January was 3.7 per cent lower than the same period a year earlier.\"\nWhile the November retail sales growth of 0.4 per cent was decent, it was substantially lower than the same period last year.\nIn November 2017, retail sales surged 1.2 per cent \u2014 but that was partially due to the enormous fanfare over Apple's release of its 10th anniversary smartphone, the iPhone X.\nWeaker economic trends ahead\nThe November figures do not indicate there will be a major improvement for the Australian economy this year, according to several economists.\n\"While the data are not as soft as market participants feared, it's probably still not enough to offset concerns of a soft fourth-quarter outcome for consumer spending, given reports of a weak December period,\" said NAB economist Kaixin Owyong.\n\"Further signs of soft spending will make it difficult for the [Reserve] Bank to credibly maintain its view that consumer spending will pick up to around 3 per cent year-over-year.\"\nRetail sales growth will average 2.5 to 3 per cent in the year ahead, according to AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver.\nHis forecast is that consumer spending will be weighed down by slowing jobs growth, wages growth remaining weak and falling house prices \u2014 which creates a \"negative wealth effect making households want to increase their saving rate\".\nThe recent plunge in petrol prices should give households a temporary reprieve, boosting consumption by 0.5 per cent in the first half of 2019, said Marcel Thieliant, senior economist at Capital Economics.\n\"We still think that the outlook for consumption is downbeat,\" he said.\n\"All told, we believe that consumption growth will slow from 2.6 per cent in 2018 to 2 per cent this year.\"\nTopics: retail, economic-trends, business-economics-and-finance, australia\nFirst posted\n}}
{{For decades the traditional day to start shopping for Christmas gifts has been the day after Thanksgiving, dubbed \"Black Friday\" in recent years, because that's the day a retailer's budget will go from red to black.\nBut not this year.\nSeveral stores are starting their holiday sales even before Halloween trick or treating has begun.\n\"I just walked by a store and there was Christmas music playing already and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m just getting ready for Halloween right now,\" says Kelly Joyce, shopper\nBlack Friday Starts Before Halloween This Year\nForget about the day after Thanksgiving, some stores are starting their Black Friday holiday sales the weekend before Halloween (Published Thursday, Oct. 28, 2010)\n\"Black friday used to a day on Thanksgiving weekend when people went shopping, but now it's a five or six week long ordeal,\" according to Brad Wilson of BlackFriday2010.com\nSears is kicking off the trend this weekend with what they call \u201cBlack Friday Now\u201d deals.\nIn addition to savings of 20% in some departments, Sears is offering extended layaway options on in-store and online purchases during the sale.\nThe store\u2019s extended layaway program allows shoppers 12 weeks to pay for purchases, according to the L.A. Times.\nOther retailers offering discounts before Halloween are Amazon, who\u2019s electronics department will offer sales on items like Blu-ray players and high-definition TVs on Friday, and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us who will put all the items in its 80-page Christmas toy book on sale on Sunday, the L.A. Times reports.\nFor the first time, Target will run a four-day sale starting the Sunday before Thanksgiving. More than 170 gift items will be discounted up to 50 percent during the sale, according to the New York Times.\nEven with the effort to capture more sales through early promotions, there is no guarantee that retailers will see a bounce in their bottom lines, the New York Times reports.\nRetail experts say in the last two years shopping started off strong in November, then trailed off as the weeks, and the impact of a poor economy, went by.\n\"I\u2019m traditional. I like it after Thanksgiving, we\u2019re all good,\" says Michelle Williams, shopper.\nRegardless of how much you are planning to spend, or when you plan to spend it, remember, there are only 57 shopping days left until Christmas.\n}}

{{DETROIT \u2014 Black Friday deals \u2014 a relatively new phenomenon for the auto industry \u2014 were expected to pull November U.S. auto sales out of their recent slump.\nGeneral Motors\u2019 sales jumped 10 percent over last November, while Toyota\u2019s sales were up 4 percent. Nissan\u2019s sales rose 7.5 percent.\nFiat Chrysler bucked the trend, with sales falling 14 percent. Other automakers were expected to report sales later Thursday.\nTotal sales of new cars and trucks were expected to rise 4 percent for the month to 1.37 million units, according to Kelley Blue Book. That would be the highest November on record, beating the previous record of 1.32 million set in 2001.\nHigher incentives enticed buyers who sat out much of the fall. July was the last month that sales increased year-over-year. In mid-November, incentives were averaging 12 percent of the price paid for new vehicles, which is one of the highest percentages in recent years, according to Barclay\u2019s analyst Brian Johnson.\nAutomakers and dealers have always flooded the airwaves with holiday ads in December. But Black Friday is taking on increasing importance. Since 2013, the weekend after Thanksgiving accounted for an average of 91 percent more sales than a typical November weekend, according to car shopping site Edmunds.com. But automakers only saw a 39 percent increase in sales that weekend in the three years prior to 2013.\n\u201cDealers and automakers clearly have found a way in recent years to break through the Black Friday clutter and connect with more car shoppers,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\u2019 senior director of industry analysis.\n}}
{{Whether you are ready for it or not, Black Friday is almost here. We\u2019ve already touched on one big Black Friday sale, and now it\u2019s time for the Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad which has leaked online.\nBefore the invention of the internet, you actually had to get a newspaper for those great Black Friday deals. Those days are long gone, and now we know what each store will carry well ahead of time. Wireless providers have gotten in on the action in recent years as well including Big Red. If you are looking for a deal through the carrier, you will be pleased with the leaked Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad.\nThe Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad consists of four pages of tech goodness with a variety of smartphones, tablets, and mobile accessories. We are going to start with the phones, three of which are $10 per month on a 2-year stint with the Galaxy S7, the Pixel Phone, and the Moto Z Droid. If you\u2019re looking to pay a bit more, you can opt for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge at $24.66 per month, the Moto Z Force Droid for $21.66/mo or the LG V20 at $19.66/mo.\nTablets are always popular during Black Friday sales, and the Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad has several of those on display. The Asus ZenPad Z10 is $149.99, the ZenPad Z8 is $99 and the Verizon Ellipsis 10 will set you back $49.99. All of those deals require 2-year activation as does the 32GB iPad mini 2 which can be yours for only $99. There are no smartwatches, but the Fitbit Charge 2 is listed for $129.99. The Alta will set you back $99 and the GizmoGadget and GizmoPal 2 are discounted as well.\nLast but not least are the mobile accessories and a few tech toys. The Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad shows a Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite Edition at $80 off while the UE Boom 2 Urban Explorer is $100 off at $99 bucks. The Beats Solo 3 On-Ear headset and urBeats Earphones have had their prices slashed, and if you want an Otterbox or Bluetooth Speaker, they have you covered there as well.\nThe Verizon Black Friday 2016 ad isn\u2019t exactly official, but you can take it to the bank nonetheless. These sales flyers leak a bit earlier each year (intentional or not) and are a great way to get an idea of what you\u2019ll be shooting for when Black Friday rolls around.\nBfads\n}}
{{CHICAGO (Reuters) - Black Friday and Thanksgiving online sales in the United States surged to record highs as shoppers bagged deep discounts and bought more on their mobile devices, heralding a promising start to the key holiday season, according to retail analytics firms.\nCustomers push their shopping carts after making a purchase at Target in Chicago, Illinois. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski\nU.S. retailers raked in a record $7.9 billion in online sales on Black Friday and Thanksgiving, up 17.9 percent from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics, which measures transactions at the largest 100 U.S. web retailers, on Saturday.\nAdobe said Cyber Monday is expected to drive $6.6 billion in internet sales, which would make it the largest U.S. online shopping day in history.\nIn the run-up to the holiday weekend, traditional retailers invested heavily in improving their websites and bulking up delivery options, preempting a decline in visits to brick-and-mortar stores. Several chains tightened store inventories as well, to ward off any post-holiday liquidation that would weigh on profits.\nTVs, laptops, toys and gaming consoles - particularly the PlayStation 4 - were among the most heavily discounted and the biggest sellers, according to retail analysts and consultants.\nCommerce marketing firm Criteo said 40 percent of Black Friday online purchases were made on mobile phones, up from 29 percent last year.\nNo brick-and-mortar sales data for Thanksgiving or Black Friday was immediately available, but Reuters reporters and industry analysts noted anecdotal signs of muted activity - fewer cars in mall parking lots, shoppers leaving stores without purchases in hand.\nStores offered heavy discounts, creative gimmicks and free gifts to draw bargain hunters out of their homes, but some shoppers said they were just browsing the merchandise, reserving their cash for internet purchases. There was little evidence of the delirious shopper frenzy customary of Black Fridays from past years.\nHowever, retail research firm ShopperTrak said store traffic fell less than 1 percent on Black Friday, bucking industry predictions of a sharper decline.\n\u201cThere has been a significant amount of debate surrounding the shifting importance of brick-and-mortar retail,\u201d Brian Field, ShopperTrak\u2019s senior director of advisory services, said.\n\u201cThe fact that shopper visits remained intact on Black Friday illustrates that physical retail is still highly relevant and when done right, it is profitable.\u201d\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF), which had predicted strong holiday sales helped by rising consumer confidence, said on Friday that fair weather across much of the nation had also helped draw shoppers into stores.\nThe NRF, whose overall industry sales data is closely watched each year, is scheduled to release Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales numbers on Tuesday.\nU.S. consumer confidence has been strengthening over this past year, due to a labor market that is churning out jobs, rising home prices and stock markets that are hovering at record highs.\n}}

{{With each passing day, Black Friday devolves into a borderless void of self-loathing (and big, big savings).\nWe've been covering the subject for weeks now. First, Macy's announced that its annual Black Friday sales will begin at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving night. Other large-scale retailers\u2014Costco, Nordstom, Dillard's, Sak's, T.J. Maxx, and Marshall's, to name a few\u2014pushed back and decided to proudly keep their doors closed on Thanksgiving Day entirely. Then, Kohl's joined Macy's at the 6 p.m. Thursday starting line, and announced its plans to stay open continuously through 10 p.m. Friday.\nNow, Kmart is (shamefully) putting everyone to shame.\nAs first reported by The Huffington Post, Kmart's Black Friday sale will begin at 6 a.m. Thanksgiving morning. The sale will last for a whopping 42 consecutive hours, one hour longer than 2013. Sears Holding Corp., which operates both Kmart and Sears, claimed that employees of both stores will be compensated with \"holiday pay\" (Sears joins Macy's and Kohl's at the 6 p.m. Thursday buffet).\n\"This holiday season is all about giving more to our members and because many like to start shopping well before Black Friday, we're excited to open our doors early on Thanksgiving and offer other early access opportunities for them to shop and save,\" Leena Munjal, senior vice president for Sears Holdings, said in a statement on the company's website.\nThese marathon shopping extravaganzas will only stop when the market demands a change.\nSo, how badly do you want those new tube socks?\n}}
{{Everyone knows Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals sometimes seem too good to be true -- a recent study put the average discount at 37 percent. There are tons of savings to be had, of course, but in some cases, the deals may not be what they seem.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman put out a list of consumer tips for those shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to help protect against fraud.\nHere are 10 key tips from Schneiderman's office:\n1. Beware of misleading bargains and added fees. The \u201csale\u201d price may have been marked up before it was marked down, nullifying the impact of the sale. Often, the touted \u201csale\u201d price may in fact be significantly higher than the price for that same item later in the season. Also, delivery charges and/or other added costs such as assembly fees are often not reflected in the \u201csale price.\u201d In many cases, hidden costs like these may negate the value of the sale.\n2. Compare warranty terms. Not all warranties are the same. Make sure you read the terms of any warranty to learn what protections you get and the duration of those protections. This could significantly affect the cost of an item over the long-run.\n3. Know the terms of a layaway plan. The law requires merchants to give a detailed description of the merchandise to be purchased on layaway plans, the total cost of the items including all charges, the duration of the plan, the required payment schedule, the consequences of missing payments, the refund policy and the location (if other than the place of purchase) where the merchandise is being stored.\nNeiman Marcus 2017 Fantasy Gifts\n4. Check return and refund policies. The law requires all merchants to post their refund policies. A store that fails to do so must give consumers 30 days to get a refund in the manner that the purchase was made. Be especially vigilant of \u201cfinal sales\u201d or \u201ccash-only -- final sale\u201d notices, as you will have little or no recourse if the merchandise proves to be defective. Some stores will require the original packaging and charge a hefty restocking fee for returned items.\n5. Beware of restricted gift cards. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of gift cards before purchasing. It is illegal to deduct any fees for non-use within 25 months of purchase or to have an expiration date of less than five years from issuance. Use your gift card as soon as possible. If it later appears that your card has expired, or that fees have been deducted, contact the company that issued the card. It may still honor the card or withdraw the fees.\n5 Things You Need to Try at the Bryant Park Winter Village\n6. Shop only on secure Internet connections. Do not conduct any transaction that involves personal, financial, or credit card information while using an open and unsecured Wi-Fi connection. Be careful not to shop, conduct business or send sensitive or personal information out on these networks because identity thieves often stake out open networks seeking victims. When entering payment information online, you should verify that HTTPS is in your address bar to protect yourself from identity thieves and cyber criminals. URLs that begin with https:// instead of the standard http:// are secured by SSL \u2013 an internet security protocol.\n7. Do not be tricked by confusingly similar website and domain names. Pay particular attention to your retailer\u2019s URL when shopping online. Scammers use variants of a known company\u2019s Internet address to try and lure users into visiting fake websites. They often target users through email or social media. Avoid clicking on links from email or social media sites. Watch out for websites with URLs that differ slightly from those of legitimate online retailers, and links that appear genuine but direct your browser to a completely different URL. To ensure safe shopping online, type the URL of your desired retailer directly into your web browser \u2014 and watch for typos.\n8. Protect yourself by using credit or debit cards. With the advent of point-of-sale malware and rampant data breaches, identity thieves are increasingly sophisticated -- and dangerous. If you are going to make purchases online, you can best protect yourself from the risks of identity theft and fraud by using credit or debit cards. Determine which is best for you and your purchase needs.\nCredit: Credit cards generally offer better purchase protection and fraud dispute resolution than other methods of payment. When you use a credit card, you are accessing a line of credit from the issuer. Note that each purchase is essentially a loan you must repay later, often with high interest.\nCredit cards generally offer better purchase protection and fraud dispute resolution than other methods of payment. When you use a credit card, you are accessing a line of credit from the issuer. Note that each purchase is essentially a loan you must repay later, often with high interest. Debit: Debit cards are tied directly to your checking account so they\u2019re best used to help avoid credit traps. There is little risk getting into debt with debit cards, but be careful of overdraft charges. Further, if your debit card is lost or stolen, you must report it within two business days to limit your loss to $50.\n9. Be wary of too-good-to-be-true contests and prize promotions. Consumers should be suspicious of any email, messages or posts on social networks promoting giveaways or contests that seem too good to be true, g., free high-value gift cards, tablets, and smartphones. These \u201ccontests\u201d are often scams designed to bilk consumers out of money and/or to collect consumers\u2019 personal information for resale. Genuine sweepstakes and contests are commonplace on the Internet, but you should avoid any contest or promotion that requires you to pay money or to perform any sort of financial transaction. Also, think twice before participating in promotions that require entrants to register with multiple third-party websites; often these are ploys to build marketing lists. Promotions that require users to provide more than simple contact information may even be phony or run by scammers who resell consumer information to collect referral fees.\n10. Read the fine print. Broadly worded promotional offers and advertisements often mislead consumers into paying full price for items they believed were on sale. Consumers should carefully examine Internet deals by reading any and all fine print in the promotional materials and identifying the exact brand and model number on sale. Consumers should also avoid bait-and-switch advertisements or promotions that lure consumers with basement prices that are not guaranteed to be in stock. Fine print stating that quantities are limited is a tell-tale sign of this bait-and-switch tactic.\nNBC's 2017 Holiday Line-Up\n}}
{{Black Friday is right around the corner, and shoppers are already being primed by retailers for the kind of buying gluttony that makes eater\u2019s remorse look like a bloated post-Thanksgiving walk in the park.\nIn the same way that dieters count calories before they start gorging in order to avoid weight gain this time of year, the best way to avoid the accumulation of extra debt is to create a spending plan, a.k.a. a budget, and then stick to it.\nWhile this may sound simple, it\u2019s not something that should exist in a nebulous way. You can\u2019t have a list in your head and engage in sensible spending unless you have an army of elves on your payroll. Make that list. Check it twice. And then forget who was naughty or nice: Spend what you can afford. Here are some more tips that can help protect your finances this holiday shopping season.\n1. Carefully Consider Store Credit Cards\nOne way to stretch your spending power is to increase your available credit. Many retailers offer credit cards with zero interest for a certain period of time, instant approval, and occasionally a decent discount\nBefore you accept the offer or decide that you can manage more available credit while maintaining a utilization ratio under 10% (a best practice for maximizing your credit score), make sure you understand the terms of engagement.\nThat zero-interest period offered in big type on the card application may morph into a high-interest loan before you know it, and with that, the likelihood increases exponentially that any discount you received for signing up will be lost to interest payments.\nIf you do elect to get a new credit card, just make sure you can manage your credit responsibly by keeping your debt levels low and making payments on time. (You can check on your finances by viewing two of your free credit scores , updated every 14 days, on Credit.com.)\n2. Note Deal Exclusions\nIt is not unusual to be mugged by your own expectations during the holiday season. This is especially the case when it comes to special offers and deep retailer discounts. Never forget that they were engineered by marketing pros to get you to the store.\nWhat happens when you get there can often be an infuriatingly familiar tale of holiday shopping woe: The particular item that you want \u2014 generally something that a lot of people want, and which sells briskly without the aid of the proffered discount \u2014 is not eligible for the promotion, something you would have known had you been able to understand the auctioneer-speed exclusions read at the end of the 30-second ad spot or taken the time to read the print ad.\nIf you see a promotion this holiday season, if the must-have toy that cannot be found is supposedly available, or if a promotion has you thinking that you\u2019re going to get off easy financially on a particular gift purchase, it\u2019s a good idea to call ahead and make sure you\u2019re not hitting the shopper frustration zone.\nRemember: If it seems too good to be true, it may well be.\n3. Beware Gift Card Fraud\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than hitting 10 outlet stores on Black Friday and coming up empty for someone on your list. Gift cards can be a great way to solve your holiday shopping shortfalls. Who doesn\u2019t like store credit? But beware of the scams.\nFraudsters have been known to photograph the numbers on gift cards at a store and then call the customer service departments identified on the back of the cards to see if (and when) they have been activated, so they can drain them. If you give a card, you might want to tell the recipient that it\u2019s best to use it as soon as possible.\nAvoid buying gift cards from a third party, since there are many counterfeiters out there and you cannot be sure that you are getting what you paid for. That said, the multiple retailer card displays that you encounter at supermarkets and pharmacy chains are generally a safe place to buy gift cards.\n4. Research Store Promotions\nThe best way to navigate Black Friday deals is to master them before you go shopping. Thinking about applying for a store credit card? Do the research before you\u2019re at the checkout counter and facing down a 10-to-20% discount. If you know which retailers you are going to visit, go online and find out what promotions they have.\nPlan your day according to those promotions, since other shoppers will have done their homework as well, and the best deals will be where you encounter the longest lines if you don\u2019t get in line at the crack of dawn.\nAs with all things shopping-related, if you do the legwork before you actually hoof it to your local mall or outlet center, you will get the best bang for your buck. Make a plan and stick to it.\nBottom line: Anyone can get through the holiday season without suffering the personal finance version of seasonal weight gain, but you can\u2019t wing it.\nMore from Credit.com\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com .\n}}

{{Human rights group Amnesty International says there is evidence Israel committed war crimes by bombarding the Palestinian town of Rafah in August 2014 after a ceasefire had been announced.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) rejected the accusation it may have committed war crimes, saying it conducts \u201call its operations in accordance with international law\u201d and denounced the Amnesty report as \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d in its methodologies, facts, legal analysis and conclusions.\nOn 1 August 2014 a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire was announced and, believing it to be safe, many people in Rafah returned home.\nLater on the same day Israeli soldier Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was captured. The Amnesty report alleges that the IDF then implemented the so-called \u201cHannibal Directive\u201d which allows Israeli forces to use intense firepower in response to the capture of a soldier.\nMassive and prolonged bombardment began without warning, while many people were on the streets.\n\u2018Inferno of fire\u2019\nAmnesty says eyewitnesses described \u201chorriying scenes of chaos and panic as an inferno of fire from F-16 jets, drones, helicopters and artillery rained down on the streets, striking civilians on foot or in cars, as well as ambulances and other vehicles evacuating the wounded.\u201d\nThe day became known as \u201cBlack Friday\u201d.\nAmnesty says that between 1-4 August 2014, at least 135 Palestinians, including 75 children, died.\nAmnesty International\u2019s Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, Philip Luther, said \u201cAfter Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was captured, Israeli forces appear to have thrown out the rule book, employing a \u2018gloves off\u2019 policy with devastating consequences for civilians. The goal was to foil his capture at any cost.\n\u201cThe obligation to take precautions to avoid the loss of civilian lives was completely neglected.\n\u201cEntire districts of Rafah, including heavily populated residential areas, were bombarded without distinction between civilians and military targets.\u201d\nLieutenant Goldin was declared dead on 2 August, and the Amnesty report claims that the continuation of the bombardment may have, in part, been \u201cmotivated by a desire to punish the population of Rafah\u201d in revenge.\nIn a statement, the IDF told Channel 4 News that Amnesty had built a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d by claiming that \u201cfour days of military operations by the IDF were in direct response to the killing and kidnapping of one IDF soldier\u201d\nRead more: UN finds credible allegations of war crimes by both sides in 2014 Gaza conflict\nThe statement continues: \u201cIt seems that Amnesty forgot that there was an ongoing conflict \u2013 during which the IDF was operating to stop rocket fire and neutralise cross-border assault tunnels, and Palestinian terrorist organisations were actively engaging in intensive conflict against the IDF from inside the civilian environment.\n\u201cThe intensive combat that occured in Rafah \u2013 throughout the confict, and not just on the dates Amnesty focuses on \u2013 were no exception.\u201d\nAmnesty produced this video detailing some of the investigative techniques it used. Israel has called the report \u201cfundamentally flawed in its methodologies, in its facts, in its legal analysis and in its conclusions\u201d.\n\u2018Forensic\u2019 analysis\nAmnesty claims to have used the \u201clatest techniques\u201d to analyse evidence including \u201chundreds of videos, photos and satellite images\u201d.\nExperts from the Forensic Architecture research team based at Goldsmiths, University of London, used a process known as geo-synching to analyse videos and match them to eyewitness accounts.\nGeo-synching involves using the angle of shadows or the shape or size of plumes of smoke as time indicators to pinpoint the exact moment of an attack in time and space.\nDirector of Forensic Architecture Eyal Weizman said his team had used \u201cnew architectural and media technologies to reconstruct complex incidents based on the traces that violence leaves on buildings during a conflict.\n\u201cArchitectural models help us draw links between multiple bits of evidence such as images, videos uploaded on social media and testimonies to virtually reconstruct the unfolding of events\u201d.\nThe IDF made no specific comment on this method of analysis, but said \u201calleged incidents occuring in Rafah during the time period covered by the report are under examination by the IDF General Staff Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism, and their findings will be used by the Military Advocate General when deciding whether to open a criminal investigation.\u201d\n}}

{{A CLOSER LOOK AT THE HOLIDAY THAT\u2019S EATING AMERICA\u2019S THANKSGIVING\nBy Megan Jones || Black Friday seems like the epitome of capitalism in this country \u2013 retailers offering up great deals on a variety of coveted products and consumers coming out in droves to acquire these must-have goods (while simultaneously spurring the economy). What could possibly be more American than that? Lately it even seems as though Black Friday is overshadowing the very holiday to which it is attached.\nThis year, retailers like Walmart and Target moved their Black Friday deals forward into Thanksgiving evening \u2013 meaning consumers could get down to the dirty work of elbowing others out of the way to score a $100 flatscreen before the tryptophan from their holiday meal even kicked in.\nWhat are the economic and societal impacts of this cult shopping experience? It seems the jury is still out on whether Black Friday actually boosts sales for retailers. Bloomberg reports: \u201cSome industry analysts say that it shifts sales earlier in the season rather than increasing demand,\u201d which would mean the whole thing is an overhyped wash. If consumers are going to spend essentially the same amount of money whether they buy during the Black Friday deals or later in the holiday shopping season, why the frenzy?\nReal or imagined, the promise of unbeatable deals on electronics and home goods seems to drive some people past good, old fashioned consumerism and into the realm of pure insanity. To see how the deal-seeking turns some people from civilized members of society into violent lunatics, one need look no further than this year\u2019s Black Friday headlines \u2013 a door smashed in at an Urban Outfitters in Santa Monica, two people shot outside of a Tallahassee Walmart, a man who pulled a gun on a line-cutter at a Sears in Texas.\nAnd what about the retailers who moved up their Black Friday hours as early as 5:00 p.m. on Thursday \u2013 forcing employees to cut short holiday time with their families?\nDespite some resistance from employees and consumers, there was no substantial backlash caused by these new practices. Casey St. Clair, an employee of mega-retailer Target, started a petition in attempt to persuade her employer to \u201ctake the high road and save Thanksgiving.\u201d Her petition asked supporters to send a message to the company\u2019s CEO, Gregg W. Steinafel, that Target\u2019s \u201c9 pm opening disgusts me and symbolizes everything that is wrong with this country.\u201d\nSt. Clair\u2019s petition received more than 200,000 signatures \u2013 but Target stores across the country opened their doors for Black Friday sales at 9:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving evening anyway.\nMeanwhile \u201cOur Walmart\u201d \u2013 an apparent subsidiary of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCWU) \u2013 organized an employee walkout to protest Walmart\u2019s Black Friday hours. Although the organizers claimed that the event was a huge success, it would seem that it was lacking a crucial element: participation. Only about 50 employees nationwide took part in the walk-out.\nOne can only hope that some of the early shoppers had the decency to thank the employees in these stores for giving up their holiday to assist these gluttonous pursuits.\nEthical questions aside, where are America\u2019s overzealous shoppers getting the funds necessary to purchase all of these \u2026 \u201cnecessities?\u201d Considering that household debt has increased in two of the last three quarters, it\u2019s safe to assume that many are putting their purchases on credit cards with the intention of actually paying the tab at a later date. That\u2019s the American way, after all (along with layaway \u2013 another \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d option that was prominently featured in this year\u2019s Black Friday advertising push).\nThen there\u2019s the growing role America\u2019s \u201cDependence Economy\u201d plays in Black Friday.\nWith 5.2 million Americans currently collecting unemployment aid and more than 100 million Americans dependent on at least one form of government aid, one has to wonder how much of this economic stimulation is really just the recycling of tax dollars taken from the producers, given to the non-producers, then spent (and taxed) again so that the ugly cycle can repeat itself without any true growth.\nAny way you look at it, debt is increasing \u2013 both household and national \u2013 although it\u2019s clearly not increasing the size of the economy. As usual, though, this day of mass consumption will be touted by many as a huge boost for jobs and the economy, even if it isn\u2019t.\nThere are those who claim that Black Friday is simply a family tradition \u2013 on par with trimming a Christmas tree or spinning a dreidel. However the glorification of a day spent pushing and shoving other people out of our way so we can save a few bucks on mostly Chinese-made products highlights the depths of materialistic depravity that we\u2019ve fallen into as a society.\nWould it honestly be so terrible to spend some time reading a book to your kids, or take a little while to listen to an elderly family member tell you stories about their childhood, or just watch some football with the people you care about the most? Aren\u2019t we supposed to stop and be thankful for friends and family during this holidays season? Not plotting ways to dig ourselves deeper into debt on new gadgets we don\u2019t really need?\nBesides, the iPads and flat screens will still be there on Monday.\n***\nMegan Jones is a wife, mother, small business owner and libertarian. She lives with her family in coastal Florida.\n}}
{{THE CHRISTMAS shopping bonanza will begin in earnest on Friday, with UK shoppers expected to spend as much as \u00a34.5 billion in a single day.\nHowever, with more than half of these purchases likely to be made online, cyber scammers are likely to be just as excited as retailers at the prospect.\nFigures from crime reporting centre Action Fraud show that shoppers lost \u00a358 million in almost 43,000 incidents of online fraud during 2017. Anyone who fails to protect themselves is at risk of adding to this year\u2019s total.\nAccording to price comparison site GoCompare, households plan to spend an average of \u00a3165 in this year\u2019s Black Friday sales, a 53 per cent increase on last year, with clothes, accessories, toys, games and electrical goods topping their lists.\nA record 57% said they will avoid the crowds by shopping online and 17% will do it via their smartphone, up from just 9% last year.\nGeorgie Frost, GoCompare\u2019s consumer advocate, said: \u201cBlack Friday has grown rapidly to become one of the UK\u2019s biggest shopping events and has transformed from a one-day event on the high street to a three-week long, online marathon.\n\u201cAs a result, we see behaviours changing, with an increase in household spend and more shopping on smartphones.\u201d\nMany of these shoppers will find themselves lining the pockets of criminals. According to Shieldpay, a third of 16 to 34 year olds, nearly a quarter of 35 to 44 year olds and one in eight over 45s have fallen victim to cyber fraud.\nTom Clementson, the secure payment provider\u2019s consumer director, said: \u201cIt is crucial that people stick to safe practice and be vigilant when buying online.\u201d\nTo ensure online crime does not spoil your festive shopping experience, stick to well-known websites and watch out for lookalike sites designed to steal passwords or financial information. These can generally be identified by poor spelling, grammar or graphics.\nIf you want to buy from a small seller, do it via a well-established marketplace such as Amazon, eBay, NotOnTheHighStreet or Etsy.\nIf your chosen item is available only from a site you are not familiar with, search for reviews of the seller to identify potential problems.\nWhoever you decide to buy from, check for a padlock icon beside the web address and make sure that the address begins with \u201chttps\u201d rather than just \u201chttp\u201d.\nIt is also important to take heed of any safety warnings sent from your browser. To ensure your software includes the latest security improvements, switch on automatic updates and keep the firewall on your computer activated to protect against viruses, other malware and hackers.\nUse strong passwords including upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols. Make passwords different for each site and never give a seller more information than the basics required to complete a transaction.\nIf you are asked to answer personal questions to authenticate or retrieve account information, consider using false details, as it is surprisingly easy for criminals to find answers such as your mother\u2019s maiden name or the name of your first pet by trawling online.\nIf you shop on a smartphone, where possible, use retailers\u2019 apps rather than websites, as mobile browsers do not always display full web addresses, making it harder to avoid copycat sites.\nNever use public wi-fi as it is too easy for hackers to intercept transactions. Use your phone\u2019s data connection instead \u2013 you should be able to link this to your tablet or laptop via the settings menu.\nIf you cannot avoid shopping over public wi-fi, use a private, paid-for VPN (virtual private network) to create a secure, encrypted link between device and retailer.\nNever follow links in emails or texts advertising special offers as these could lead to fake sites set up to steal your details. If an offer looks too good to be true, it probably is.\nBefore finalising a purchase, check the retailer\u2019s contact information and returns policy in case anything goes wrong.\nNever pay by bank transfer. For purchases over \u00a3100, use a credit card to get additional protection if the seller goes bust, goods fail to arrive or are faulty.\nFor smaller transactions, opting for PayPal avoids sharing card details, and if there is a problem you can use its dispute resolution process.\nWhen you finish shopping, sign out of the site fully to ensure no one else can access your data, and, if you are using a shared computer, clear the cookies.\nCheck bank and credit card statements regularly and query transactions you do not recognise. If you think you have been the victim of fraud, report it at actionfraud.police.uk.\n}}

{{A Victoria\u2019s Secret employee screamed and feared for her life on Nov. 23, when customers nearly tackled her as they fought each other for $35 hoodies. Watch here!\nYikes! We\u2019ve always known that shoppers could get pretty rowdy on Black Friday, but things took a wild turn in Chattanooga, Tennessee on Nov. 23, when a large group of customers stormed into a Victoria\u2019s Secret and terrified a sales associate. As you can see in the video below, shoppers ran inside the store as soon as the gate opened. A female sales associate could then be heard screaming, \u201cWait! Wait! Oh my God!\u201d before the crowd nearly trampled over her. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! It\u2019s really not that serious,\u201d she kept yelling as she jumped on top of a display table that was holding a pile of hoodies the shoppers were after.\nBy the time the sales associate asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d four times in a row, the table was left completely empty. And she was left alone, wondering why the shoppers had gotten so aggressive. The hot item everyone was after was a Sherpa fleece sweatshirt, marked down from $90 to $35. Obviously, that seems like a good deal, but it\u2019s not something worth fighting over, right? Some shoppers could be seen laughing in the video, while others looked terrified as their bodies got shoved up against the display table. Fortunately, ABC News claims no one was hurt.\nA terrified sales associate climbs a table as shoppers storm a Victoria\u2019s Secret in Chattanooga, Tennessee. #BlackFriday2018 pic.twitter.com/GUitXffGPE \u2014 USA TODAY Video (@usatodayvideo) November 23, 2018\nLast year, however, things got so violent on Black Friday that police were forced to shut down an Alabama mall.

{{By now, it's common knowledge that some people have made small (and, in some cases, not-so-small) fortunes on Bitcoin. But even though U.S. regulators and lawmakers gave bitcoins a tentative thumbs up last week, and an increasing number of merchants are accepting them as legal tender, you still can't walk into most retailers and spend them.\nEnter Bitcoin Black Friday, designed to harness the indefatigable spirit of American consumerism to bring the world's most popular cryptocurrency into the mainstream. Shoppers will be able to spend their digital ducats this Friday not only on gift cards to Target, Banana Republic, Sears and other major retailers, but on airline tickets, Christmas trees, organic coffee, OK Cupid memberships, alcoholic beverages, Moroccan rugs and more.\nMore than 250 merchants are participating in the one-day shopportunity for Bitcoin users, a pumped-up version of a similar event launched last year by Bitcoin proponent Jon Holmquist. This year, Holmquist has teamed up with Internet activist group Fight for the Future to organize the event. Backers include the Bitcoin Investment Fund, Silicon Valley Angel and Ribbit Capital, who have helped with promotion and outreach to merchants.\n\"Bitcoin is at a very pivotal moment,\" Wilson says. \"Since we feel like it's such an important and powerful technology, and something that could be really positive for the world, we think it's really important that it cross over and go mainstream as soon as possible. Because that's the moment when it becomes politically safe.\"\nThe goal of Bitcoin Black Friday is to speed things up that process, according to a media release.\nRelated: Trekking Into Space With Branson? You Can Now Pay Your Way in Bitcoins\nCoinbase, one of the largest U.S.-based Bitcoin exchanges and a Bitcoin Black Friday sponsor, will be waiving its transaction fees on Friday. The exchange, which has raised more than $6 million of investment capital from major Silicon Valley players, usually charges a 1-percent fee for buying and selling bitcoins.\nThe shopping event puts the lie, at least for 24 hours, to the claims of Bitcoin critics that the cryptocurrency isn't very useful. \"You can't use Bitcoin for much today besides gambling in online casinos and reserving seats on Virgin Galactic spaceflights,\" former Gawker writer Adrian Chen said Tuesday in an opinion piece for The New York Times. But in fact, to give just one example, you can buy the aforementioned gift cards with bitcoins on any day of the year through Gyft.com; the Black Friday deal simply provides a slight discount on the purchase price.\nEven so, Chen is right to point out the \"speculative greed\" fueling much of today's Bitcoin trading. On Coinbase, the price of a single bitcoin is now close to $1,000, and the price has already reached quadruple digits on some exchanges. The crash, predicts Chen, will be great.\nWilson disagrees, though he admits that some Bitcoin traders are just out to make a quick buck. \"What speculators are betting on is that Bitcoin will become widely used.\" And that, he says, \"would be great for a number of reasons,\" among them the ability to avoid credit-card processing fees, a feature of Bitcoin which Chen acknowledges. \"If Bitcoin succeeds, it's going to become the currency of the vast majority of online transactions,\" Wilson says.\nIf Bitcoin can gain mainstream respectability quickly enough by proving its usefulness to merchants and consumers, it may forestall the crash that some market watchers think is coming.\nRelated: Alleged Creator of Silk Road Detained Without Bail\n}}
{{Black Friday is not just for Thanksgiving-celebrating Americans. Amazon today announced that in the UK, where it has also been running Black Friday sales, it sold a record number of Kindle devices \u2014 triple the previous record amount. As usual with Amazon, it is not giving a hard figure on how many actual units this means, or how many e-readers it sold compared to Fire tablets.\nBut it looks like at least some of the focus of activity here \u2014 at least as Amazon would like it to be seen \u2014 is on its Kindle Fire tablet.\nOn Amazon.co.uk, the Kindle Fire has been discounted to \u00a399 ($159), from an earlier price of \u00a3129, \u201cand the reaction has been incredible,\u201d said Jorrit Van der Meulen, Vice President, Kindle EU, in a statement. \u201cCustomers purchased more than three times as many Kindle devices on Black Friday than on any other day in its history on Amazon.co.uk, and our previous record was impressive.\u201d\nAmazon is running the sale \u2014 which should see a nice boost in the number of Kindle Fire tablets in use in the UK \u2014 until midnight on Monday, November 26.\nAlthough Amazon has been selling the Kindle Fire tablet in the U.S. for a year now, it only started to make its way to international markets in September 2012. In Europe, it is increasingly feeling the heat of competition from the likes of Barnes & Noble, which has also launched its Nook range abroad, signing retail deals with department stores in lieu of having an established network of bookstores as it does in the U.S. to promote it. And Apple has also moved into the smaller-tablet range with the launch of the iPad Mini.\nIn addition to selling the Kindle Fire online, Amazon is also working with UK bookstore Waterstones to sell the device in physical stores.\nRelease below.\n}}

{{Sometimes shopping during Black Friday can feel like betting on a prize fight. You plunk down all your money on a great pair of shoes on Black Friday, only to see their price get knocked down during a Cyber Monday blowout. But how can a shopper know what kinds of unadvertised, winning sales are just around the corner? On everyone's mind this season is the question of whether Thanksgiving, Black Friday, or Cyber Monday \u2014 or the span of time in between these holidays \u2014 will be the best time to shop for the specific items they want.\nIf you're tired of feeling like you've got long odds for finding the best Black Friday deals, then look no further. We studied the DealNews archives for the past two Black Friday seasons and found the best items to buy on each day throughout the shopping weekend. And while trends can always change, and \"off\" deals can still pop up at any given time, it's still wise for a shopper to be aware of these general rules of thumb while crafting the perfect personalized Black Friday shopping game plan.\nBest Things to Buy on Thanksgiving\nSmartphones\nThanksgiving has the edge when it comes to sales on phones, apps, and accessories. In fact, based on sales from last year, we could see smartphone deals that yield a profit (via gift cards) as early as the Wednesday before Black Friday. Although on average we list the same total number of phone deals on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, we recommend that you do your smartphone shopping on Thanksgiving: 42% of all the phone deals that day in 2012 were sweet enough to be marked Editors' Choice, as opposed to just 31% of those listed on Black Friday. Moreover, we found 50% more Android phone deals on Thanksgiving. However, if you're looking for that elusive iPhone deal, then you're better off on Black Friday proper (see below).\nHDTVs\nOur research shows that HDTV deals are excellent on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but Turkey Day TV deals stood out in the last few years for two reasons. First of all, we tend to see more Editors' Choice TV deals on Thanksgiving: about 61% of our deals were marked as such. Secondly, these Editors' Choice TV deals are much better on Thanksgiving. On Black Friday, for example, we typically see TVs that are at all-time price lows for their model (i.e., the lowest total price we've seen on a specific Samsung 46\" HDTV). Yet over the past two Thanksgivings, we've seen TVs at the very best price in their entire category (like the best-ever price for anySamsung 46\" HDTV).\nGaming Items\nWhen it comes to deals on video games, there's just no beating Thanksgiving. We saw 70% more gaming deals during the last two Thanksgivings than on Black Friday. The difference is even more astounding when it comes to Cyber Monday. On average, there were 229% more gaming deals on Thanksgiving than on Cyber Monday. Plus, about 67% of the video game deals we saw on the last two Thanksgivings were awesome enough to be marked Editors' Choice. However, don't expect any significant price lows on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One games or consoles; it's beyond rare to find discounts on new consoles during their first Black Friday.\nBest Things to Buy on Black Friday\nLaptops and Computers\nFor deals on computers, especially laptops, Black Friday stands out. On average, we saw a few more laptop deals on Thanksgiving, but we found a far bigger quantity of Editors' Choice laptop deals during the past two Black Fridays. In fact, in both 2011 and 2012, we listed more Editors' Choice laptop deals on Black Friday thannon-Editors' Choice deals \u2014 in 2011, about 62% of the deals we listed were hot enough to be marked as such. So if you're on the lookout for that predicted 15\" dual-core laptop for $170, Black Friday is definitely your best chance to find it.\nStorage\nRunning low on data storage? Black Friday is also the perfect time to take advantage of great hard drive, USB flash drive, and memory card deals. While you'll see a huge number of Editors' Choice-quality deals on all three days of the Black Friday season, day-of Black Friday deals themselves were the most prevalent. On average, Black Friday boasted 33% more storage deals than Thanksgiving, and nearly 85% more storage deals than Cyber Monday. And since quantities tend to sell out fast during these shopping holidays, knowing there are more deals to choose from can increase your chances of finding something in-stock at an outstanding price.\niPhones (maaaaaybe)\nApple iPhones have been difficult to come by during the past two Black Friday seasons, but we predicted that this could be the year that changes all that. However, unlike the trends for smartphones in general, if you're looking to score an iPhone deal, our research shows that you should wait until Black Friday; all past iPhone deals during this time have shown up on Black Friday proper.\nKitchenware\nFor those who are all set on tech, Black Friday sales can also offer an excellent selection of kitchenware deals. Not only did the past two Black Fridays offer more deals for small appliances, cutlery, and kitchen gadgets on average than Thanksgiving or Cyber Monday, but about 54% of the kitchen deals we listed were marked Editors' Choice.\nBest Things to Buy on Cyber Monday\nClothing and Shoes\nAlthough Cyber Monday tends to offer significantly fewer tech deals, it's the undefeated heavyweight champion when it comes to clothing and shoe deals. On the past two Cyber Mondays, we saw an average of 45% more clothing deals than on Black Friday, and about 53% more deals than on Thanksgiving. We also saw about 50% more shoe deals on Cyber Monday than on Black Friday or Thanksgiving.\nWhat's more, last year we saw an even greater number of Editors' Choice clothing and shoe deals on Cyber Monday \u2014 32% of apparel deals were marked Editors' Choice during Cyber Monday 2012 alone. As we mentioned in our Black Friday clothing predictions, many clothing and shoe retailers will offer their best stacking coupons of the year during this time, so waiting until Cyber Monday to make your fashion purchases could yield some serious savings.\nBest Things to Buy During Black Friday Weekend\nWhile it tends to be overshadowed by more popular bookend shopping days, the weekend of Black Friday before Cyber Monday features a number of quality, multiple day sales. More sale days mean more chances to fill your cart with bargain-priced goodies and fewer worries about time-sensitive deals expiring all the time. But the tradeoff is that Black Friday weekend deals aren't always the best we've seen all year. However, there are two categories where Black Friday weekend sales do stand out: tools and appliance deals.\nTools\nWhile we tend to see the same average number of tool deals on any given day of the Black Friday season, we tend to see a significant increase in the number of Editors' Choice deals over Black Friday weekend. Therefore, if you're looking for that perfect gift for the handyman or woman in your life, it's more expedient to check out the weekend tool sales. After all, as we previously mentioned, this is the best time all year to buy tools and hardware, so why not grab the sweetest deal you can?\nAppliances\nFinding a jaw-dropping deal on a large appliance isn't hard during the Black Friday season; in 2012 alone, 42% of the appliance deals we saw at this time were marked Editors' Choice. But during the Black Friday weekend sales last year, we saw a larger concentration of appliance deals, 46% of which were marked Editors' Choice.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

{{Hard-core shoppers used to prepare themselves each year for the one-day retail festival known as Black Friday. They collected their coupons, threw on their comfiest shoes and headed out into the cold and dark to brave the crowds. Now, that\u2019s all changing. With almost every major retailer opening their doors this year on Thanksgiving, those deep discounts will start earlier and last longer, right through to Cyber Monday. Brad Wilson, the shopping guru who founded BradsDeals.com and BlackFriday.BradsDeals.com, says the shift \u201cis a big deal.\u201d \u201cIn past years, everyone started out at 5 or 6 a.m. and made one bet on one item,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI like the fact that its spreading out. It lets us, as consumers, take advantage of more good deals.\u201d For some, it may seem as if retailers are hijacking a great American holiday, but shopping experts say it was consumers who encouraged the change by voting with their feet. Last year, 35 million shoppers visited stores and store websites on Thanksgiving, up from 28 million the previous year, according to the National Retail Federation. In fact, 22 percent of shoppers say they\u2019ve already started their holiday shopping, according to the Nielsen Holiday Shopping Survey. Even after the big holiday weekend, shoppers will still be eager to spend money again on Cyber Monday, which is growing in popularity. According to the Nielsen survey, about half of all shoppers say they plan to make purchases that day, up 16 points from last year. With so many eager shoppers, and six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, stores will engage in some serious competition to get consumers\u2019 attention \u2014 and their money. One chief way they\u2019ll compete is by offering some of those monster deals for Thanksgiving, instead of saving them for Black Friday, as they did last year. Wilson was especially giddy about Walmart, which is offering a 32-inch television on Thanksgiving for $98. Dev Shapiro, of Gottadeal.com, was excited last week about Target\u2019s Black Friday circular, which offers a 50-inch television for $229 on the same day. And both pointed to Thanksgiving Day deals on iPads at Walmart and Target that come with a $100 gift card. Shoppers who don\u2019t venture out over the holiday weekend will find other sales and markdowns, Wilson says. But those sales will be inventory driven and won\u2019t include the cornucopia of goods that are being offered during the Thanksgiving weekend. For those who do plan to shop early and also join the throng of 250 million who will shop online or in stores on Black Friday weekend, you\u2019re going to need a plan. Here are a few tips:\n1.\nDon\u2019t wait for Thanksgiving: Good sales are out there now \u2014 in stores and online. To find them, check out retail websites, newspapers and coupon sites such as GottaDeal.com, DealNews.com or BradsDeals.com.\n2.\nDo your research: Compare prices to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal. \u201cJust because it\u2019s Black Friday doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a good deal,\u201d Shapiro says. In addition to the shopping sites, there are plenty of Black Friday sites that will point you to some bargains.\n3.\nPrioritize: Most stores will have one or two really fantastic doorbusters to draw shoppers in. They won\u2019t last long, so you\u2019ll have to pick the one you want most and go for it. One retailer, however, is trying to give shoppers more reason to come out on Thanksgiving for these special deals: Walmart is promising to have enough of its doorbusters in stock so that they\u2019ll be available for sale for at least an hour after the store opens.\n4.\nHave a plan of attack: Online shoppers should prep by registering on retail sites now. It\u2019ll save time when you\u2019re trying to snag a hot deal before it sells out. You should also check out shipping costs in advance and make sure you have enough credit on the cards you want to use. If you\u2019re venturing out, go online and get a map of the store, so you\u2019ll know where to head once you get through the door. Also check out the store\u2019s return policy to make sure you can make a return with no hassles, if you change your mind about an item later.\n5.\nLook out for extras: Specifically, shopping experts say consumers should stay away from warranties offered by stores because customers rarely use them. Instead, Wilson, of BradsDeals, suggests that shoppers use select credit cards that offer extended warranties on items purchased with the cards.\n6.\nTake the ads with you: Some stores \u2014 including Target, Walmart and Best Buy \u2014 promise to price-match items, so you\u2019ll need proof of the lower price and model numbers that match up. However, be warned that not all stores that price match will do so on all of their items.\n7.\nDon\u2019t go alone: In numbers, you can attack different areas of a store, or even different stores. You and your shopping buddy can take turns waiting in excruciatingly long lines, while the other one tears through the store looking for other deals.\n8.\nDress comfortably: Gear up in layers \u2014 but don\u2019t wear too many clothes, or crowded stores will start to feel like a sauna. Don\u2019t carry a heavy purse.\n9.\nWatch your liquid intake: It\u2019s not easy to take a potty break if you\u2019re standing in line with hundreds of others outside a department store.\n10.\nStay safe: There\u2019s no need to push anyone, and stay away from anyone else who is doing any running or pushing.\n}}
{{Fantastic Beats and where to find them\nBlack Friday is continuing to close in, and as we near the actual day of mega-sales, prices are continuing to be cut across the internet. Today (Wednesday 22) there are two amazing deals on Beats headphones at two different websites \u2013 so if you\u2019ve been meaning to upgrade to a better set of headphones, here\u2019s the perfect opportunity.\nThe first deal is over at Argos, and it\u2019ll bag you 10% off Beats\u2019 Solo2 over-ear headphones. They use a cable \u2013 no Bluetooth \u2013 so they\u2019re very straightforward to use. On their strong points, Trusted Reviews have praised their noise isolation: \u201cThey block out more sound than the Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear and the B&W P3, and are better suited for use in the gym.\u201d Right now at Argos they\u2019re down \u00a310 from \u00a399.99 \u2013 the lowest price ever for this model.\nThe second Beats deal is at Currys/PC World, where you\u2019ll get \u00a380 off a much higher-end model, the Studio 2.0. This model offers wireless Bluetooth listening, and it\u2019s got decent noise-cancelling capabilities too. What Hifi? praised this model\u2019s \u201crich deep bass\u201d and \u201cexciting, upfront sound\u201d but said that they\u2019re less suited to quiet music, and even suggested the \u201cbass bias will be too much for some\u201d. Right now they cost just \u00a3219 \u2013 a 26% reduction from the model\u2019s original price of \u00a3299.\nStay tuned to NME.com for more Black Friday deals \u2013 we\u2019ll be highlighting more of the best bargains over the coming days.\n}}
{{Snatching up a doorbuster deal on Black Friday is a little bit like winning the lottery: You\u2019ll feel pretty lucky if it happens.\nBut unlike the random drawing of the lottery, picking Black Friday deals requires careful planning. Here are some tips, tricks and hacks that could increase your odds of getting the best deals while shopping online on the day after Thanksgiving.\nKnow when and where to shop\nInventory can sell out online just like at a physical location, especially if the rise in online shopping continues. In 2015, online sales rose 16% on Thanksgiving Day compared to the same day in 2014 and increased 7% year-over-year on Black Friday, according to analytics firm Slice Intelligence.\nTo get the best deals, prepare early by following the sale advertisements from your favorite stores before Black Friday. They likely will indicate which deals will be available online. Last year,Kohl\u2019s offered its doorbusters exclusively in stores, while Best Buy made almost all deals available online and in stores.\nThe ads also will tell you what time the sales begin online. This year, Dell will debut its online sale on Nov. 23, while Office Depot kicks things off at 12:01 a.m. Nov. 24 (Thanksgiving Day).\nMake an online account beforehand\nOnce you pick your desired stores and online sites, create an online profile ahead of time. Most retailers let you save information such as your shipping and billing address on their websites. This will expedite the purchase process and may help you get doorbusters before they run out.\nLog on early\nPunctuality is key. Make sure your computer or phone is ready for action a few minutes before the sale begins. Sign into your profile, scope out the products you want by size, color and other options, and then bookmark those webpages so that you can find them easily when the big event launches.\nReview membership perks\nIf you\u2019re a member of a retailer\u2019s loyalty program or have a store credit card, you may receive Black Friday perks. Some companies lower prices or grant early access to sales for loyal customers. Year after year, Victoria\u2019s Secret has given its Angel cardholders the first shot at Black Friday deals before other buyers.\nUse multiple devices\nIf have a tablet and a laptop, why not use both of them? If a website is lagging when a sale starts, utilize as many devices as possible to see which one will load the site faster. That could help you snag a deal faster.\nSeek stackable discounts\nBlack Friday prices typically are low, so retailers may not offer additional discounts. But there may be coupon codes or free shipping offers that can be applied to your order. Look for these on a retailer\u2019s website or its Black Friday ad, or on coupon aggregator sites. And, as always, compare prices between retailers to see which one has the best deal.\nMaximize savings\nShopping online can provide additional savings. If you\u2019re a member of a cash-back website such as Ebates or BeFrugal, for instance, activate your cash back by logging into the sites and then clicking over to your retailer of choice. If there\u2019s a cash-back offer at the time, you\u2019ll get a percentage of your purchase back. If you don\u2019t have such an account, create one before the sales start.\nIf you have a rewards credit card, you may be able to get relevant cash back on your Black Friday purchases, depending on the bonus purchase categories offered by the card issuer.\nKeep your personal information safe\nAlways be cautious about transmitting your personal information and credit card number over the internet. Make transactions only on websites your know and trust. Submit your financial information only over a secure connection (and not on public Wi-Fi).\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

{{If you thought the Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj beef had lost steam, think again. The Queen Bee announced that she will be dropping her 'Black Friday' mixtape just in time for Valentine's Day. Since Kim, has been in an all out verbal war against Minaj for several months, there's a pretty good chance that, despite the Feb. 14 release date, the mixtape won't be about love.\n\"Black Friday the Mixtape - 2/14/11- WHO THE F--- WAR? #ItsBlackFridayHoe LEGOOOO!!!!!\" Kim tweeted Wednesday (Jan. 26).\nBack in November, Kim dropped the track 'Black Friday,' dissing Minaj, and then cast a Minaj lookalike for the song's music video. Although Minaj has been less aggressive with her response, it doesn't look like these two will become friendly anytime soon. \"I saw her coming in the game like, 'All you chicks that's been in the game for 10 years, move over,\" Kim explained in an interview with Hot 97's Angie Martinez. \"I thought that was disrespectful. Then she started saying stuff that was almost direct[ly] towards me ... and you could tell.\"\nMinaj's fondness for colorful wigs and female presence in an all male rap crew, has long been compared to Kim. Yet since dropping her platinum selling debut 'Pink Friday' last November, the 26-year-old is slowly but surely etching out her own lane in hip-hop history. \"She just really jumped out the window and you got to be careful when you pick fights,\" Minaj told Martinez of Kim. \"I think people get me mistaken with a real Barbie. They forget where I'm from and if I have to revert back, I can and I will. It's one of those moments where you say, 'Don't play with me,' because I respect you, I love you, I've said it in every interview time and time again, and if that's not good enough with you mama, then it's something deep rooted in you,\" she reveals. \"Something is bothering you inside. That's your insecurity bothering you. [If] it's not Nicki Minaj, it would have been any girl that started poppin'. She picked a fight with Foxy [Brown], then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy [Ma], then it was Ms. [Voletta] Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj.\"\nAlongside the mixtape, Kim is also said to be working on a full-fledged album release.\nListen to Lil' Kim's 'Black Friday'\n}}
{{The Friday after Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday partly because it marks the first day of the year that retailers turn a profit, and this year, the profit they're going to be able to turn could be much bigger than last year's. According to the National Retail Federation, holiday shoppers will spend 4.1% more this year than they did last holiday season. It remains to be seen which companies capture the bulk of this growth this season, but three retail stocks that investors should consider buying are Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (NASDAQ:OLLI), and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).\nSears Holdings' slide is a boon to this department store chain\nKohl's generates about 30% of its annual sales in November and December, and this year, those sales could benefit if shoppers shift to it from Sears due to rising concern over Sears' bankruptcy.\nKohl's predominately sells apparel, footwear, accessories, and beauty and home products. Apparel and soft home goods like bedding account for roughly 32% of Sears' merchandise revenue, or roughly $4.3 billion in revenue last year.\nKohl's reported its latest quarterly results this week, and they suggest it has momentum heading into Black Friday, when it plans to offer bargain prices on electronics and toys to help drive foot traffic.\nIt saw 2.5% comparable sales growth last quarter, and improving inventory boosted its margin, helping its earnings per share surge 40% higher than one year ago. Department stores must compete against e-commerce, but Kohl's is making progress on the digital side of its business too, and that's helping offset some of the risk from companies like Amazon.com. Last quarter, its digital revenue grew at a mid-teens rate.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a tailwind Sears' struggles will be for Kohl's this season, but on its quarterly conference call, management told investors that it thinks competitive store closures (eh-hem, Sears) are boosting results at up to one-third of its 1,100 stores. If that trend continues, this could be a good time to buy Kohl's shares, because its share price tumbled 10% following its earnings release, despite results outpacing industry watchers' forecast and management upping its full-year earnings-per-share guidance to $5.16 to $5.36 from $4.96 to $5.36 previously.\nEverybody loves a bargain\nPeople love \"good stuff cheap\" all year long, but they especially enjoy a bargain during the holidays, which are the busiest time of the year for Ollie's Bargain Outlet, a 22-state, 300-store chain.\nThe retailer sells brand-name \"food, housewares, books and stationery, bed and bath, floor coverings, electronics and toys\" that it buys at cut-rate prices from manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers who are overstocked or closing. For example, Ollie's acquired $200 million in toys from suppliers when Toys R Us closed its stores forever.\nThe bargain business has been a good one. Ollie's sales grew at a compound 17% rate between 2012 and 2016. In 2017, its sales increased 21% to $1.08 billion, due in part to its store count increasing by 14%. There's plenty of opportunity for it to open more stores too. The company operates in less than half the country currently, and management thinks the U.S. could eventually support more than 950 stores.\nOne-of-a-kind growth\nIt would be easy to recommend Amazon.com to investors as a top stock to buy this holiday season. After all, it's the de facto e-commerce Goliath, and it produces 34% of its annual revenue in the fourth quarter. Instead, I'm recommending its much smaller and, dare I say, \"craftier\" competitor, Etsy. Like Amazon, Etsy makes its money from e-commerce, but unlike Amazon, Etsy profits most from the sale of one-of-a-kind goods made by individuals rather than mass-produced goods made by companies.\nEtsy's online marketplace connects nearly 2 million creative entrepreneurs with more than 33 million active shoppers on the hunt for unique items. Each time a sale is made, Etsy pockets 3.5% of the purchase amount for its trouble. Etsy also makes money from listing fees and seller services, including promoted listings and Etsy Payments, its tool for accepting online payments.\nThose small percentages and service fees add up to big bucks for investors. Etsy shoppers bought $3.3 billion in merchandise in 2017. As a result, Etsy's marketplace revenue grew 13.5% year over year to $179.5 million, and its seller services revenue grew 28.7% year over year to $258.5 million last year.\nEtsy's growth is accelerating ahead of Black Friday, too. In the third quarter, its revenue surged 41.4% year over year to $150.4 million, and its $0.15 in earnings per share clocked in $0.08 better than analysts were expecting. Those results prompted management to increase their revenue forecast for this year to at least $3.87 billion from $3.84 billion previously, which is a 35% increase from 2017.\nOf course, shoppers can be fickle, and there's no guarantee that Kohl's, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, and Etsy will continue their winning ways this holiday season. Nevertheless, I think they have a good shot at rewarding investors with better-than-expected sales on Black Friday and beyond this year. If they do, including them in portfolios now could be smart.\n}}
{{Peninsula residents waited in long lines to score some of the best Black Friday door-buster deals starting on Thanksgiving Day.\nAccording to a survey from the National Retail Federation, around 69 percent of Americans (164 million people) planned to shop over the Thanksgiving weekend. Among those were people ages 18-34, who were predicted to spend more than 38 percent more in 2017 compared with last year.\nThe Daily Press talked to a few shoppers in that demographic, who ditched having a traditional Thanksgiving to shop on Thanksgiving Day at Best Buy and Kohl's in Newport News.\nBest Buy\u2019s hottest Black Friday items were televisions, games, cellphones and drones, according to assistant store manager Adam Beaber.\nBy 4 p.m. the line was more than 200 people longer than in 2016, Beaber said. Best Buy let 100 people in at a time and had a designated area for customers who received television tickets. All tickets for the televisions were handed out by 4 p.m., he said.\n\u201cThe turnout is way more than we expected,\u201d Beaber said. \u201cWe are really happy about it and this is going to be one of our best years in the last five to 10 years.\u201d\nYoung shoppers such as LaRon Williams, 18, of Newport News, went Black Friday shopping for one person - his brother. The pair were the first in line at Best Buy and took turns throughout Wednesday evening and Thursday waiting in line. Williams said his brother wants a new soundbar system that\u2019s a Best Buy Black Friday door buster.\nShoppers looking for deals on Thanksgiving and Black Friday at big box and department chain stores.\nAccording to Williams, his brother got in line early Wednesday afternoon while the store was still open. They waited in line in shifts and kept themselves busy on their phones while sitting in lawn chairs and taking short breaks to relax and listen to music in the car.\n\u201cI\u2019m just here for my brother and doing him a favor by waiting in line,\u201d LaRon said. \u201cIt feels nice outside today and he seems to be really thankful that I\u2019m doing this for him,\u201d Williams said.\nDirectly behind the brothers was Mitchell Glover, 23, of Newport News. Glover arrived around 6 p.m. Wednesday to set up his blue and gray tent along the side of Best Buy with his two brothers. Throughout the day, the siblings also took turns waiting in line and dropping off food to one another.\nGlover chose to sleep outside, while his brothers slept in the car overnight.\n\u201cI brought a tent because it was warmer than sleeping in the car,\u201d Glover said. \u201cI've done this before so I know this from experience that the tents get warmer.\u201d\nThe group was waiting to buy the Sharp 50-inch LED 2160p Smart 4K Ultra HD Roku TV for $179.99 as well as some smaller televisions and laptops. Although their Thanksgiving will be spent at Best Buy this year, Glover assured his family they will still get together around the table for a Thanksgiving dinner a few days later.\n\u201cOur family is having Thanksgiving dinner, but it starts around four,\u201d Glover said. \u201cThe store opens at five and we also do another Thanksgiving on Sunday. So I miss an hour of one Thanksgiving and I get a bigger one on Sunday. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\nRichard Jones, 28, of Newport News, was also waiting in line for the Sharp 50-inch TV. Jones was fifth in line and had been waiting inside his red and yellow tent since 2 a.m. Thursday morning. He brought his phone and food to keep him busy while in line. He also routinely went to his car for other items throughout the day.\n\u201cI had to stake my claim on this territory so I can get the best deal,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI wasn't shocked to find people ahead in line. I was going to sleep in my car, but because people were here, I had to make a place for myself.\u201d\nJones said he came to Best Buy after searching through various newsletters and other online sites, only to find that Best Buy had the best deal on the television he wanted.\n\u201cIt feels good to be here knowing I can get what I want and I will probably end up shopping for other things once I\u2019m inside,\u201d Jones said.\nJust a short way down Jefferson Avenue from Best Buy, Kohl\u2019s only had around seven people in line by 3:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, despite having an opening time of 5 p.m.\nArianna Gonzalez, 18, of Newport News, was shopping with her teenage brother Adrian Gonzalez and boyfriend Joshua Duncan, 19, of Newport News. The trio were the first in line at Kohl\u2019s.\nHowever, first time was a charm for the first-time Black Friday shoppers, who weren\u2019t expecting to be the first people in line. The group arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m. and waited while covered in a Virginia Tech blanket, watching television. They were shopping for a Canon camera set and an Xbox One.\nAccording to Arianna Gonzalez, they tried to get their door busters online earlier on Thanksgiving Day. Kohl\u2019s opened its online shopping at 1 p.m., but the camera set and Xbox One were already sold out.\n\u201cThere are lot less people than we thought would be in line,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we came and were the first people, we were so happy to know we were going to get our stuff first.\nJoseph can be reached by phone at 757-374-3134.\n}}
{{The most often asked question regarding Black Friday deals is, \u201cCan I buy the item today and get a Black Friday price match for the deal later?\u201d The second most asked question is can I get aa price match at Walmart for a deal at Best Buy or another retailer.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Black Friday price match options and price protection for the purchases you make ahead of Black Friday.\nIt sound sounds like a great plan. Buy Black Friday doorbuster at regular price and get an adjustment on Thanksgiving Day after the craziness calms down. There are a lot of catches to this, but you may be able to use your credit card for help.\nNew and veteran Black Friday shoppers are always on the lookout for shortcuts to savings that allows them to skip lines and get limited stock items before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. One common idea is to use a Black Friday price match or price protection to get a better deal, but there are some roadblocks.\nMost stores now offer a price match option to cover deals from other retailers and many also offer a price guarantee or price protection to match their own price if it drops \u2014 but many of these price match options will not work for Black Friday 2016.\nThis is what you need to know about Black Friday price matches before you start planning your shopping trips. The short version is, most retailers suspend price matching and price guarantees for Black Friday 2016 starting on Thanksgiving Day through the end of the day Cyber Monday.\nThe good news is that we normally see big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Walmart price match deals in the days leading up to Black Friday by simply lowering their price to the new lowest price.\n2016 Black Friday Price Match\nBelow you\u2019ll find the 2016 Black Friday price match details and catches for some of the top retailers. On almost any other day of the year you can get a price match from these stores to the other \u2014 but on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday 2016 this stops.\nBest Buy Black Friday Price Match Details\nMost days the Best Buy price match policy will help you save on a new purchase and sometimes on a recent purchase.\nThis stops on Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. The Best Buy Price match does not cover, \u201c\u2026 items for sale Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving, whether offered by Best Buy or a competitor\u201d\nKeep this in mind as you plan out how you will shop for items in the lead up to Black Friday and on Black Friday 2016. You can also not stack Gamer\u2019s Club Unlocked onto many of the video game deals.\nWalmart Black Friday Price Match Details\nThere is good news and bad news when it comes to trying to get a Walmart Price Match on Black Friday.\nThe good news is that when you are in store you can get a Black Friday price match to local competitors and to select online competitors. The problem with this is that the best online deals are limited time offers that may be out of stock by the time you get a manager to approve a price match \u2014 especially on Thanksgiving or Black Friday.\nIf you plan to shop online, which is a bigger part of the Walmart Black Friday 2016 plans, you cannot price match. The policy states, \u201cWalmart.com will not Price Match from Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving\u201d\nTarget Black Friday Price Match Details\nTarget Black Friday price match policies don\u2019t break from the rest of the top retailers. Normally Target will price match a range of local and online stores, but the company suspends this for the shopping event.\nIn the Target price match policy the company states, \u201cPrice matches and adjustments will not be allowed for prices from Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving, whether offered by Target or a competitor.\u201d\nAmazon Black Friday Price Match\nAmazon offers a price guarantee on HDTVs. This sounds like a great deal, but there is a limitation to the Amazon Black Friday HDTV low price guarantee.\nAmazon explains one limitation is, \u201cThe Guarantee will not apply to Comparable Offers which are promoted or marketed as limited time sales or offers, which last for 72 hours or less, such as Lightning Deals, Gold Box Deals, Black Friday, \u201cearly bird\u201d or \u201cdoor buster\u201d offers (\u201cLimited Time Promotion\u201d). The Guarantee will also not apply to Eligible TVs purchased as part of a Limited Time Promotion by Amazon.\u201d\nAny other time of the year the Amazon TV low price guarantee is a great option, but it won\u2019t help you on Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday 2016.\nBlack Friday 2016 Price Match Tips\nIf you do want to try to get a Black Friday price match this year, Walmart is your best option, but even then it is not going to be easy. Most deals sell out fast and you will need to get a manager to match the price before the competitor and the store are out of stock.\nWith options to shop online for most Black Friday 2016 deals, it makes more sense to simply buy online and wait for the delivery than to try to hassle with a Thanksgiving Day price match.\nMost retailers offer free shipping during this time of year and others have free shipping on more expensive items. Anything worth trying for a price match on Black Friday should hit free shipping minimums.\nSome credit cards offer price protection up to a certain amount. Discover is one of them, but you should contact your card issuer to ask about price protection for items sold during a special shopping event like Black Friday.\nBest Black Friday 2016 Deals and Ads\n}}

{{Kendrick Lamar and J.

{{If you're not a member of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime yet, you're part of an ever-shrinking minority. The company typically keeps figures like this close to the vest, but earlier this year -- in an uncharacteristic display -- CEO Jeff Bezos gave investors their first peek behind the curtain. In the company's annual shareholder letter, Bezos revealed that Amazon Prime's paid memberships have topped 100 million globally.\nBezos didn't provide any additional color, but an estimated 61% of Amazon customers in the U.S., or about 97 million Americans, are Prime subscribers, according to estimates compiled by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). With Black Friday and the holiday shopping season bearing down, many who haven't taken the plunge may be asking themselves: \"Should I sign up for Amazon Prime?\"\nNot just free shipping\nIf you're considering finally breaking down and getting a Prime subscription, you should know that there are many more benefits than the free two-day (or faster) shipping, though this is typically the major draw. Sitting at a keyboard to place an order without ever having to leave the house, and having that order delivered within a couple of days, has a certain appeal -- particularly if it means avoiding the melee of holiday shopping.\nThat said, there are other reasons to join. A membership includes access to Amazon's vast library of movies and television shows available on Prime Video. Cord-cutters can also sign up with a number of other streaming providers like HBO, Showtime, Starz, and many more -- and view them all within Prime Video.\nOther benefits abound, including streaming music with Prime Music Unlimited. As the name implies, it provides unlimited access to more than 2 million songs and hundreds of Prime Playlists, as well as discounted plans to Amazon Music Unlimited, which has an even larger song catalog. Prime members get exclusive savings at Whole Foods grocery stores, 5% cash back for holders of the Prime Rewards credit card, and free digital books and magazines from the Prime reading catalog for use on the Fire Tablet, Kindle e-reader, or popular Kindle reading apps that can be downloaded on most smartphones.\nThe company also hosts the annual Amazon Prime Day, which is billed as \"Black Friday in July.\" The members-only sale offers deeply discounted items, flash sales, and deals on thousands of the site's most popular goods. The 2018 event boasted 36 hours of deals, which included Whole Foods for the first time, as well as significant discounts on many Amazon-branded electronics.\nGetting more than it's giving\nAmazon isn't giving away all these benefits out of some sense of altruism; the company gets far more than it gives away. According to CIRP data, Prime customers on average spend $1,400 per year, versus the $600 per year spent by nonmembers. It makes sense that once customers have plunked down their hard-earned cash for a Prime membership, they want to be sure to get their money's worth. Forgoing that trip to the store can be as easy as a few keystrokes, and your purchase will arrive in a couple of days.\nResearch also shows that once someone becomes a member, renewal rates actually improve over time -- 93% of customers renew after the first year, and 98% renew after the second year, according to CIRP.\nJust for Black Friday?\nIt's important to point out that Amazon Prime offers a 30-day free trial, so if you're only going to use Prime to take advantage of the Black Friday offers, a monthly or annual commitment may not be worth it. An annual membership currently costs $119, with monthly subscriptions of $12.99.\nThere are lots of reasons to like Amazon Prime -- as evidenced by the more than 100 million people who have signed up. But if you're only going to use a membership for Black Friday deals, I'd go with the free trial.\n}}
{{NEW YORK (AP) \u0097 Black Friday fatigue is setting in.\nEarly discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said Sunday.\nOverall, 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four-day weekend, down 5.2 percent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group.\nTotal spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year, the trade group estimated.\nPart of the reason is that Target, J.C. Penney, Macy\u2019s, Wal-Mart and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as Halloween. Some opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving. All that stole some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend.\nStill, the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices.\nMatt Shay, the trade group\u2019s CEO, said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas.\nAnd shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages.\n\u201cWhile they\u2019re more optimistic, they\u2019re very cautious,\u201d Shay said. \u201cIf the deals are not right for them, they\u2019re not going to spend.\u201d\nBottom line: Expect more deep discounts, all season long.\n\u201cEvery day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday,\u201d he said.\nThat could be what it takes to get shoppers to open their wallets for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about 20 percent of annual retail sales.\nBesides economic factors, people are becoming more discerning when they shop. Armed with smartphones and price-comparison apps, they know what\u2019s a good deal \u0097 and what\u2019s not.\nKimani Brown, 39, of New York City, was among the Black Friday defectors. After four years of braving the crowds, the sales failed to lure him out this year.\n\u201cI consider myself a smart shopper. And it\u2019s not as alluring as it used to be,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s a marketing tool, and I don\u2019t want to be pulled into it.\u201d\nHe also said the frenzy pushed him to overspend, and he paid the price in January on his credit card statement.\nInstead, he said he will look online Monday, the online shopping day often called Cyber Monday.\nSome who went shopping on Thanksgiving felt they were doing it against their will. Cathyliz Lopez of New York City said she felt forced to shop on the holiday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ruining the spirit of Thanksgiving,\u201d the 20-year-old said Thursday. \u201cBut I was checking all the ads, and the best deals were today.\u201d\nThe National Retail Federation is still predicting a 4.1 percent increase in sales for the season. That would be the highest increase since the 4.8 percent gain in 2011.\nSome stores and malls had reason to be optimistic.\nDan Jasper, a spokesman at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, said customer counts are up 5 to 6 percent for the four-day weekend. One plus: Shoppers were buying more for themselves, a sign of optimism.\n\u201cThey felt confident in the economy,\u201d he said.\nCEOs at Target and Toys R Us said they saw shoppers not just focusing on the doorbuster deals but throwing extra items in their carts.\nMacy\u2019s CEO Terry Lundgren told The Associated Press on Friday that he\u2019s hoping lower gas prices will help spending.\n\u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe that confidence should continue to grow. That should be good for discretionary spending,\u201d he said.\nSome of those discretionary dollars are migrating online.\nTarget said Thanksgiving saw a 40 percent surge in online sales and was its biggest online sales day ever. And Wal-Mart reported Thanksgiving was its second-highest online day ever, topped only by Cyber Monday last year.\nFrom Nov. 1 through Friday, $22.7 billion has been spent online, a 15 percent increase from last year, according to research firm comScore. On Thanksgiving, online sales surged 32 percent, while Black Friday online sales jumped 26 percent.\nIn stores, shoppers spent $9.1 billion on Black Friday, according to research firm ShopperTrak, down 7 percent from last year. That was partly due to a 24 percent surge in Thanksgiving sales, to $3.2 billion.\nShopperTrak estimated that in-store sales for the two days combined slipped half a percent to $12.29 billion.\n______________\nFollow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio at https://twitter.com/adinnocenzio\n}}
{{Investors might not have guessed it from the weak outlook that GameStop (NYSE:GME) gave for its fourth quarter, but the company has some big plans in place to dominate video game retailing this holiday season. And while that's true for many retailers, there are some good reasons to believe that GameStop can actually do it.\nStarting strong\nFor one, the company is entering the next-gen console upgrade in the strongest competitive position that it's seen in years. After logging a 15% boost in new software sales last quarter, GameStop's share of that market grew by more than 5 percentage points.\nThings are looking even better on the hardware side, as it boosted share by 7 percentage points there. Company president Tony Bartel described GameStop's current market share as sitting at \"peak levels,\" which was likely a big factor behind the blowout 20.5% comparable-store sales rise that it booked in the quarter -- GameStop's best performance since early 2008.\nStaying loyal\nNext, there's the company's loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards, which just passed 26 million members in the United States. And just as Starbucks does for its massive loyalty program, GameStop counts that user base as a major competitive advantage. The direct line of communication it has with all those members allows GameStop to drum up business, and it gives the company a unique and proprietary look at demand around the industry.\nFor example, GameStop's recent survey found that a full two-thirds of its members expect to own either a Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One within the next year-and-a-half. That's valuable information for the retailer to have, but GameStop can also use that data to lobby the two console makers for a bigger allocation of what's sure to be tough-to-find devices on Black Friday.\nTrading up\nHowever, here's another insight that GameStop pulled from its loyalty member base: The single biggest thing holding back all of those next-gen purchases is affordability. At $400 for the PS4 and $500 for the Xbox One, those systems threaten to eat up a huge portion of any shopper's holiday budget.\nBut that's where GameStop's vibrant trade-in business comes into play. The retailer aggressively pushed for trade-ins last quarter, which led to a total of $300 million in credit that was mostly used to buy new games and hardware. Gamers with pre-owned systems and software titles swapped them in, and effectively got a discount on their new purchases. In fact, GameStop says that new product purchases are usually funded around 14% with trade-in credit, making them that much more affordable, and giving the retailer a leg up on the competition over a key pressure point for consumers.\nFoolish bottom line\nJust about every major retailer has plans to \"win\" this holiday season. And for many of them, that means being competitive on sought-after electronics like next-gen consoles and mobile devices. GameStop took a different tack this week by telling investors to expect a slowdown in sales growth to between 2% and 9% in the holiday quarter. However, the company looks primed to beat that guidance, thanks of the success that it should have around the Black Friday shopping crush.\n}}
{{DENVER, Coloradio \u2014 Times are changing for the biggest shopping day of the year, and it\u2019s not just store opening times. So KMGH television station in Denver decided to look into the changing face of the \u201choliday\u201d after the holiday.\nTraditional Black Friday is still going on\nAll you have to do is look online or in stores to find signs and ads for the multitude of doorbuster deals.\nIn fact, more and more people have shopped on Black Friday over the last five years, and people are expected to spend about 4 percent more this year on holiday shopping, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\u201cIt is fun to just be in line and literally run through the store and literally grab that one item,\u201d shopper Katie Hilton said.\nIt\u2019s a tradition for some, a hunt for mega-deals for others, and both for some die-hard shoppers.\n\u201cThe thrill of the chase, it\u2019s fun. If there\u2019s something you want and a great deal and you grab it or your daughter does, it\u2019s fun,\u201d she said.\nDwindling lines?\nBut over the last few years, the scenes of massive crowds, lines winding blocks long, and people fighting over treasured deals seem to happen less and less.\nThis year there will be fewer big box stores in existence on Black Friday. Toys-R-Us, Radio Shack, Sears have all gone out of business.\nKMGH asked University of Denver Associate Professor of Marketing Ali Besharat if fewer stores like the ones above could lead to shorter lines.\n\u201cI hope so and I hope that transition happens over time,\u201d he said.\nTime with family vs. time in line\nBesharat is referring to how much time people spend waiting to get deals at a brick and mortar store, in many cases on the actual Thanksgiving holiday.\nOver the last few years, competing stores have moved opening times earlier and earlier. In 2018, many like Best Buy and Target opened at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. JCPenny opened at 2 p.m.\nKMGH\u2019s Jason Gruenauer spoke with his personal Black Friday expert, his mom, to weigh in on this part of the debate.\n\u201cBlack Friday is not Black Friday anymore. It\u2019s turned into Black Thursday. And you have to go shopping on a holiday and that\u2019s terrible,\u201d Cheryl Gruenauer said.\nEarly deals water it down\nThe demand for Black Friday sales has pushed some stores to offer deals early, meaning fewer people have to wait in line for Thursday or Friday to come.\nLast year, Cabelas savings could be found two weeks ahead of time. And you didn\u2019t have to wait if you wanted a TV at Costco.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with the crowds or get up at 2 a.m.,\u201d one shopper told us.\nBig box to small biz\nIf the \u201cbig box\u201d retailers aren\u2019t your thing, the so-called \u201cantithesis of Black Friday\u201d happens just hours later. The push to support and buy local has pushed some shoppers to do their holiday buying on Small Business Saturday.\n\u201cThis is the community. It\u2019s businesses like this that create the atmosphere that you want to be in,\u201d a holiday shopper at the Stanley Marketplace told KMGH.\nThe biggest threat\nLikely the largest reason that traditional Black Friday is changing comes from the internet. The invisible lines of online shopping and Cyber Monday are making major waves.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen less and less in-store traffic every year for the last several years. It truly is the Amazon effect,\u201d marketing professor Darrin Duber-Smith of Metro State University said.\nIn fact, multiple retail surveys showed more than half of consumers say their holiday shopping will be done online.\n\u201cThe comfort of your own home and looking at the screen, comparing deals, looking at prices and reviews for that product,\u201d Ali Besharat explained.\nSpeed of evolution\nWhether it is the size of the line, the time of the opening or the migration to small business or online, the definition of Black Friday is changing. But experts say it\u2019s slow moving.\n\u201cOver time absolutely the effect of it will be washed down and mitigated over time,\u201d Besharat said.\n}}
{{Just as tens of millions of Americans are preparing to start their Black Friday shopping, the nation's largest retailer has admitted to a new data breach \u2014 but it's making only a few details public.\nAmazon customers across the U.S. and in Europe report receiving a strange email, that appears to be a phishing scam.\nAn example of the email is listed below.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR AMAZON.COM ACCOUNT \"We're contacting you to let you know that our website inadvertently disclosed your name and email address due to a technical error. The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action.\" Sincerely, Customer Service http://Amazon.com\nSome tech blogs speculate that the email is a phishing scam, because of the way it is worded. In addition, the email asks users to not change their passwords, and the email signature that includes an \"http\" iURL instead of an \"https\" (which means the URL is secure).\nBut Amazon has confirmed to the The Register UK and The London Telegraph that the email and breach are real. Companies are required under British law to report any data breaches immediately, well before US law requires them to divulge an issue.\nHowever, American customers are also reporting they have received the email.\nWhat you should do\nAmazon is not sharing how many customers were affected, if any information beyond email addresses were shared, and whether the company was hacked.\nComing just one day before the start of Black Friday shopping, it is concerning.\nSeveral security experts suggest that user change their password anyway if they have received this cryptic message from Amazon.\n_______________\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook\nFollow John on Twitter ( @JohnMatarese )\nFor more consumer news and money saving advice, go to www.dontwasteyourmoney.com\n}}
{{With Target and Best Buy both rolling out aggressive free-shipping deals this holiday season, Wal-Mart Stores might need to unveil some Black Friday goodies of its own to maintain its torrid online growth.\nTarget is waiving home-delivery fees for all holiday orders, the industry's latest shipping promotion. Electronics seller Best Buy has done the same, proving that the most contested battleground for retailers this holiday season is the so-called last mile \u2014 getting products to customers' door.\n\"Retailers are competing for share and if they are not competitive in the holiday season, consumers won't choose them next year,\" said Erik Morton, vice president of strategy and corporate development at e-commerce software provider CommerceHub.\nThe moves put the spotlight on Wal-Mart, which has yet to disclose its strategy for the critical Black Friday promotional period. The world's biggest retailer rolled out free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items in January, and U.S. online chief Marc Lore has credited the offer with helping the company post web sales growth of at least 60 percent in recent quarters \u2014 about double the pace of Target and Best Buy.\n\"Wal-Mart has them in the rearview mirror right now,\" Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research, said.\nFree-shipping deals have become increasingly essential for online sellers, even though they take a toll on the bottom line. Target has trotted out similar promotions every year since 2014. More than half of shoppers who abandon their online shopping carts do so because the delivery options were too expensive, according to a survey conducted last year by Research Now on behalf of e-commerce software provider MetaPack.\nFor the first time ever, more shoppers will look for gifts online than in stores this holiday season, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation. The industry association projects that total holiday retail sales will rise as much as 4 percent this year to about $680 billion.\nTarget is also offering more than 100 Black Friday deals on Nov. 22 for holders of its proprietary \"Red\" card. The retailer's 1,828 stores will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, just like last year, and close at midnight. That's a change from previous years, when stores stayed open throughout the night and into Friday. This year, stores will reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday.\n}}
{{The other evening, I had a most unique dining experience. Perhaps the fact that it was the night after Thanksgiving could explain some of it.\nMy guest and I walked into a large, beautiful dining room with fresh flowers on every table and found ourselves completely alone: no other diners, no hostess, no wait staff. After a bit, a very sweet lady came by and told us to sit anywhere we liked.\nShe brought us a menu and went to get us some water. When she returned, we asked her for a recommendation, and she took my menu and looked it over but seemed confused and continued searching it for some particular dish. Finally she said, \"I'm sorry, but I am a banquet waitress. The rest of the staff didn't come in tonight.\"\nWe asked if we could see the wine list, and she went to get it but said she couldn't find it. So she asked if we wanted red or white. We said \"white,\" and she went in the back to look at the bottles and brought us the names of four whites from which to choose.\nWe were making our selections at this lovely Peruvian restaurant called Muelle Peruvian Cantina (located in the newly renovated Hotel Huntington Beach) when a charming gentleman came over and introduced himself as Chef Renzo (full name Renzo Emilio Macchiaveilo). He discussed the menu, made suggestions and told us the plates are smaller, allowing guests to taste more items.\nTo our knowledge, this is the only Peruvian restaurant in Orange County that is offering the small-plate concept, with smaller prices. He also mentioned that the place had only been open for three weeks and things were still being worked out.\nWe placed our order and sipped our wine, and a plate of crusty sliced baguette arrived with house-made potato chips, toasted Peruvian corn and the classic spicy green chili sauce \u2014 aji verde.\nI'm a fan of jalea de mariscos, which is like fried calamari but with shrimp, scallops, fried yucca, whitefish and tiny rings of calamari, all strewn with toasted corn and pickled onions in lime juice (salsa criolla). The seafood was coated in a very light tempura-like batter that was devoid of grease. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious.\nWe had more of the tasty fried shrimp in the chicharron de camarones, served with two versions of aioli for dipping, one with a bit of green pepper and one with red.\nAfter these appetizers, we selected our entrees, which were also smaller. Since Peru is a coastal country, Peruvian restaurants have lots of seafood on their menus. I had a small but delicious piece of pan-seared Chilean sea bass in a wonderful sauce spiced with rocoto peppers and cilantro and an underpinning of Asian flavor. Scattered on the plate were a few scallops and shrimps.\nPeru has the second-largest Japanese population in the world, so it's no surprise that Asian flavors appear in many dishes. This is true of the lomo saltado, which is a stir-fried dish with Cantonese elements merging with Peruvian. Thin slices of chicken are cooked in a sauce with onions, tomatoes cilantro, garlic and French fries. The dish is served with white rice on the side and is flavorful and hearty. You can also get it with beef or fish.\nA similar dish (tallarin saltado) features noodles and vegetables in place of fries and rice.\nDesserts are few, but we had the churros and the mango mousse. What made the churros a little different was the addition of caramel in the center. The mousse was very mild and light, as was the thin slice of cake under it.\nWhen we got our bill, the waitress said that she didn't have the prices for the desserts and said we also got \"the 30% discount,\" which wasn't mentioned anywhere but was fine by us.\nAlthough things seem a bit disorganized, I have no trouble recommending Muelle Peruvian Cantina. The food is quite good, the room is very attractive and the prices are reasonable.\nTERRY MARKOWITZ was in the gourmet food and catering business for 20 years.

{{In a surprise move, Apple might just give tech-happy holiday shoppers an early gift to start the season. The company updated its homepage Tuesday with a bold declaration for its biggest fans: \"Friday can't come soon enough.\"\nYou read that right. For the first time since 2014, Apple is once again participating in Black Friday. And unlike its deal two years ago, when the company simply offered iTunes gift cards with certain purchases, Apple is teasing a discount on hardware. The homepage image displays a shiny new Apple Watch.\nDetails are sparse, however. The only thing we know boils down to two sentences: \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\"\nUntil now, we've depended on Apple's retail partners as the only place to find deals on any of the iDevices we're hoping to give (or just straight up buy for ourselves) over the holidays. Just this year, we assumed that the best sale we could expect on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would either be available at HHGregg or Walmart.\nApple's recent holiday initiatives have been centered less on doorbuster-style deals and more on gestures \u2014 promotions for the PRODUCT(RED) AIDS initiative, for example.\nAsked about skipping out on Black Friday at the 2015 Fast Company Innovation Festival, Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said \"being good to your employees will always be good for business,\" according to 9to5mac.\nApparently, 2016 is different. While there is no concrete information available on exactly what will be on sale, the homepage touts free two-day delivery on in-stock items before 5 p.m., Apple Store App capabilities and extended in-store hours, which appear to vary by location.\nIf you're planning on going to a brick-and-mortar Apple Store, be sure to call ahead or check online to confirm the hours. And be ready for the massive Black Friday turnout that only Apple can draw. If you think Best Buy and Walmart pull in the crowds, you've got another thing coming.\n}}

{{It looks as though Microsoft is getting a second wind in the console sales race thanks to the arrival of the Xbox One S . The Xbox One has outsold the PlayStation 4 for the past four months , reversing a trend that has seen Sony dominating the sales race for the past three years. Microsoft chalked up another victory during Black Friday , once again edging out the rival PlayStation 4.\nThese figures come courtesy of Adobe\u2019s annual market-tracking data, which pegged the Xbox One as the fifth best-selling electronics product in the U.S. during Black Friday. It was outpaced by the Apple iPad, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air, and LG TVs. Adobe didn\u2019t indicate how the PlayStation 4 ranked on that Black Friday list, but we\u2019d assume that it wasn\u2019t too far behind the Xbox One.\nWhile Microsoft is likely elated to have beat the PlayStation 4 once again, Adobe\u2019s analysis shows that Microsoft might not get its fifth consecutive monthly sales victory. Adobe\u2019s numbers show that so far this month (November 1st through 24th), the PlayStation 4 has outsold the Xbox One. You can chalk up some of Sony\u2019s strength to the launch of the potent PlayStation 4 Pro.\nBoth the Xbox One S and PlayStation 4 Slim could be easily had for $250 during the days leading up to Black Friday. Target perhaps had one of the best deals in recent days on the Xbox One S, offering an additional 15 percent off the $250 price for the Battlefield 1 and Minecraft bundles, and throwing in a free 3-month subscription to Xbox Live.\nAdobe aggregated data from over 22 billion visits to retail sites, and measured 80 percent of all transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers.\n\u201cShoppers hit the buy button at unprecedented levels as conversion rates were up nearly a full percent across all devices in the evening hours on Black Friday,\u201d said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director for Adobe Digital Insights. \u201cWith the full day total coming in at $3.34 billion, Black Friday may have just dethroned Cyber Monday's position as the largest online shopping day of the year.\u201d\nAdobe also had some insight into this season\u2019s electronic devices that were most likely to be out of stock. The list shouldn\u2019t surprise, with products like the Nintendo NES Classic Edition, PlayStation VR bundle and PlayStation 4 Call of Duty Black Ops bundle topping the list.\n}}

{{\u00d7 Black Friday Deals: People spent $4.15B online before Super Bowl of shopping started\nAmerica\u2019s top retailers reported strong sales last quarter, and retail analysts believe the trend will continue on Black Friday and throughout the holiday season.\nSo far, so good: Online shopping between Wednesday through 5 p.m. ET Thursday has totaled $4.15 billion according to Adobe Analytics data, surpassing last year\u2019s total spend for the same time period.\nAmericans so far have spent $1.75 billion on Thanksgiving Day, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Adobe projects online sales to hit a new record of $3.7 billion \u2014 up from the $2.9 billion spent on the same day in 2017.\nWednesday, the day before Thanksgiving when retailers ramp up their Black Friday sales, was also another record breaking day. Sales increased 32% over last year to $2.4 billion. Adobe says yesterday was the first day in online shopping history to have half of visits to retailer websites come from mobile.\n\u201cMobile stole the show Thanksgiving Day with smartphones representing more than 50% of traffic to retail sites, as well as record amount of revenue,\u201d Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights said in a statement.\n\u201cAs consumers turn their focus to Black Friday, we expect them to take full advantage of the many discounts available, driving new records for online sales.\u201d\nRetail sales will grow 4.8% this holiday season, according to an IBM forecast. That\u2019s stronger than last year\u2019s strong 4.2% growth. Appliances, clothing and jewelry will be the biggest hits this holiday season, IBM predicts.\nDigital sales are already booming in November, rising 16.7% over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. Electronics, including Nintendo consoles, Amazon Fire TVs and Amazon Echo speakers, are among the top sellers so far this month. Adobe expects retailers to deeply discount computers, TVs and tablets on Black Friday to boost sales.\n\u201cWe are on track for another blockbuster season for e-commerce,\u201d said Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement.\nRough week for retail stocks\nBut Wall Street remains worried retailers\u2019 plans to win the holiday shopping season will be costly. A busy day for retail earnings Tuesday sent several stores\u2019 stocks sharply lower.\nTarget (TGT) announced sales and profit margins that fell short of investors\u2019 high expectations. Despite a robust 5.1% sales gain at stores open for at least a year and 49% digital growth, Wall Street punished Target for struggling to keep down costs. Target\u2019s spending has been rising as it races to ship more orders online and compete with Amazon.\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) also reported a positive quarter Tuesday, but a similar story played out on Wall Street. Kohl\u2019s has found creative ways to reformat its stores and drive traffic, but investors faulted the company for guidance that came in on the lower end of some analysts\u2019 expectations.\nLast week, Walmart (WMT) reported 3.4% quarterly growth at stores and boosted its guidance for the holidays. But profit missed from fulfilling online orders.\nOne company bucking the trend was Best Buy (BBY), which said same-store sales rose 4.3% last quarter, its sixth straight quarter above 4%. Unlike other stores, profit rose too. The company raised its forecast in anticipation of consumers buying up TVs and electronics this holiday.\nSome stores warned that the holidays wouldn\u2019t be as strong as some had hoped. Discount powerhouse TJX Companies (TJX), parent of TJMaxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, reported a 7% rise in same-store sales last quarter as consumers flooded in to find bargains. But TJX disappointed with sluggish guidance.\nOther retailers have been unable to take advantage of the healthy environment. JCPenney (JCP) said last week that same-store sales fell 5.4% last quarter. Victoria\u2019s Secret (LB) and Barnes & Noble (BKS) are under fire too. Victoria\u2019s Secret cut its divided and same-store sales dropped 6% last quarter as the brand loses touch with many women. Barnes & Noble\u2019s same-store sales fell 1.4% last quarter. Sales at Gap\u2019s (GPS) flagship brand fell off 7% last quarter.\nInvestors are stepping up pressure on companies to take advantage of a healthy economy. Wages are rising, unemployment is low, and retail spending continues to rise. Also, longtime rivals Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Bon-Ton have folded and Sears filed for bankruptcy, raising the stakes for retailers to pick up market share left up for grabs.\n}}
{{KARACHI, May 23: The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100 shares plunged by 615 points or close to the maximum of five per cent on what many investors thought was \u2018black Friday\u2019 for the market. It was the biggest single-day decline since the start of the current year.\nTraders said that everyone had expected equities to drop, following the monetary measures announced by the State Bank of Pakistan on Thursday, which included a massive increase of 1.5 per cent in key discount rate to 12 per cent from 10.5 per cent.\n\u201cThe central bank\u2019s initiatives aimed at curbing inflation proved to be just an excuse for the already jittery market,\u201d said a stock broker. He lamented that the market had been held hostage to uncertainty on the political front and an increasing bleak economic picture, reconfirmed by the downgrading by international rating agencies -- Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s.\nBut nervous investors have been moving out of the equities since mid-April. The index has shed 2,664 points or 17 per cent of the value in just 24 sessions since the current meltdown began. From its dizzy height of 15,676 points on April 18, the index dived to 13,012 points on Friday. In the process, a cool sum of Rs1 trillion ($13 billion) have been wiped off the market capitalisation.\nThe free fall of equities on Friday was exacerbated by the critical statement from PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari regarding President Musharraf, evidencing fissures in the relationship between the presidency and PPP, which otherwise were perceived to be smooth going.\nTraders said that there were many \u2018margin calls\u2019 at the market which forced weak-holders to unwind their long positions, but luckily no defaults.\nAdnan Afridi, KSE managing director, affirmed that risk management systems were in place and that exposures had been collected on time.\nArif Habib, former KSE chairman, said that investors were hoping things to fall in place after the general elections, but none of that happened. He thought that the SBP measures announced on Thursday had proved as the last straw on the camel\u2019s back. \u201cSince returns on risk-free investments have been increased, investors in risk-bearing equities have also raised their expectation for a corresponding higher return,\u201d he said.\nMr Habib estimated that the equities carried risk premium of around six per cent over fixed income investments.\nMohammad Sohail, director equity broking at JS Global, said that the mandatory floor of five per cent return on saving deposits imposed by the SBP was totally unexpected and came as a rude shock to both the local and foreign investors.\nMarket could see a major hit on the profitability of banks. With 25 per cent weightage in the KSE index, the banking stocks were first to fall on Friday, pulling down the rest of the market.\n}}
{{Black Friday is essentially when the Christmas shopping season starts. Although it\u2019s not yet December (a curmudgeon writes) Friday 25th November will see a spike in spending if previous years are anything to go by. Figures from Nationwide business and consumer credit cards show that last year spending increased 43% compared to a normal Friday, peaking at 1.30pm.\nThere have been warnings about the effects of fatigue on drivers working zero hours contracts as they try to keep up with delivery schedules (see this story from the Guardian, which also points to a 12% increase in parcels to be delivered). This website, however, is devoted to IT.\nAnd the complexity demanded of technology in retail transactions in this season is matched only by the sheer volume. If IT professionals are in any doubt about the robustness of their systems, now would be a good time to do some intensive testing.\nBlack Friday allows data collection\nOne should probably assume that any retailer of any size will have a decent and robust point of sale system in place as well as stock control and warehousing. Recently, however, newer technologies have emerged that will impact the customer experience.\nFirst there is the contact centre, whether outsourced or kept in house. Self-service and automation are increasingly common and the experience has to be satisfactory, particularly since the aforementioned Nationwide research suggests one in eight Black Friday purchases will be returned by the customer. Dissatisfied customers can do huge reputational damage on social media so they have to be happy even when they\u2019re taking money away.\nThose customers will also be offering their data, consciously or otherwise, contributing to the Big Data available to the larger retailers. This is the point at which not only data protection laws kick in (of course) but also analytics. Big Data is only as much use as the questions it is asked. For example, anecdotally from my own experience (and not scientifically researched), when e-commerce first started and you could order groceries online, your editor ordered a weekly shop that included lemon juice. The store had run out of juice so it sent lemon-scented washing up gloves instead (they tasted foul).\nMore recently, your editor had to order a part to do a minor plumbing repair. The online retailer from which he purchased the part sent weekly entreaties to buy another for months afterwards, when a better-informed system would have worked out that the repair was successful, no further parts would be needed.\nOn a larger scale this sort of error will impact the experience of a large number of customers and once again, will hit reputation \u2013 and take up attention spans that could have been shown more appropriate marketing.\nIntegration with logistics\nThe other part of Black Friday in part and Cyber Monday in its entirety is e-commerce. Not only does your business need a robust and secure system for its customers (whose confidence will have been shaken by last week\u2019s incident with Three and other recent breaches) but this needs to integrate with product delivery.\nWhether your company chooses to outsource delivery or to perform the function in-house, links between the customer\u2019s ordering system and the delivery infrastructure need to be of the smoothest. Preferably customers need to be able to track their deliveries online or through an app. You might or might not have the resources of an Amazon, which will tell you when your product is going to be delivered; your customer, increasingly, will expect this as a minimum level of service.\nBlack Friday is this week and will be followed by Cyber Monday one week from today. If you\u2019re in retail your systems had better be ready \u2013 and by \u201cready\u201d we don\u2019t just mean able to take lots of orders.\n}}
{{\nThe instructions for the game say it all: \u201cPunch yourself in the face to stay awake, but don\u2019t punch too much or you will die.\u201d It\u2019s a game that isn\u2019t especially scintillating, but it\u2019s a simple and funny commentary on the whole Black Friday experience.Basically, you have to punch yourself to stay awake, and you can jump, and it\u2019s really easy to kill yourself. That\u2019s the whole game. You get a higher score depending on how long you can hold out without either dying or falling asleep.Black Friday has become an unsavory part of an otherwise great holiday. It\u2019s true that some families make a tradition out of it, bundling up and heading out at midnight together to seek some good shopping deals, but far too many seem to completely forget themselves. At the far end of the dark spectrum you see those awful videos of people being trampled, but plenty of others simply turn into line-cutting, product-snatching bullies and jerks.Let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not humanity\u2019s finest day every year. We\u2019ll take our chances on Cyber Monday , thanks very much.\n}}

{{There was a tradition in the Mahoney household that involved a lot of sleep after the Thanksgiving meal.\nAs a card-carrying member of the kids' table, I took this for granted, that one day I would be old like my father, uncles and grandfather who would expend every last bit of energy on the family meal before throwing in the towel.\nI lived in a family of slugging Roberto Durans, each of us fighting to pack in one more helping of Mimi's (my grandmother's) pumpkin pie. The couch-cushioned naps that served its epilogue were our \"No mas.\"\nThe following day, Mimi would disappear with my mother for a few hours while we played in the snow or watched a movie. About a month later, I would discover what they were up to when unwrapping presents under the tree.\nThey'd be gone a few hours, wait in a couple lines at some stores. The whole thing was civil. Quaint, really, when you think of what the Thanksgiving shopping scene has become \u2014 before Black Friday and its recent progeny, Gray Thursday.\n\"Black Friday,\" the saying goes, \"because only in America do people trample each other exactly one day after being thankful for what they already have.\"\nThis Black Friday, I plan to not shop at the big-box stores. There are plenty of other days to do it, and plenty of sales between now and Christmas.\nThere are better things to do.\nFor starters, you can head over to the Burbank Rose Parade Float just under the bridge at 123 W. Olive Ave. They need volunteers from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to work on the float titled \"Lights ... Camera \u2026 Action!\"\nYou could set up a time and location with the Burbank Coordinating Council for its food drive on Dec. 7. They're still looking for volunteers to collect food and assemble gift baskets for Burbank families. Email ccholidaybaskets@aol.com or call (818) 843-3699 to sign up.\nYou could write a letter to a stranger. Donna Ricci, owner of Clockwork Couture at 707 S. Main St., recently started a pen-pal program to cast away the confines of emails and 140-character musings. She is pairing up total strangers to rekindle the lost art of handwritten correspondence \u2014 a great activity for an autumn evening with a cup of hot chocolate at your side.\nThe shop isn't open on Friday, but it will be on Small Business Saturday. This movement is backed by corporate sponsors such as American Express, Facebook and FedEx in a bold display of irony or hypocrisy, depending on your point of view. The end result: A push to get consumers shopping at small businesses that might otherwise be overshadowed by the big advertisements of the big boxes.\nAnd if you absolutely must shop on Friday, there are lots of ways to turn that trip into a benefit for local nonprofits such as the Coordinating Council or Burbank Temporary Aid Center.\nBarbara Howell, chief executive of the center, says the organization will need the same types of Thanksgiving fare as it gets into winter. It's accepting donations of turkeys, hams and nonperishable items such as macaroni and cheese mix. You can drop off your donations to them next week at 1304 W. Burbank Blvd.\nBesides food, Burbank Temporary Aid Center and the Coordinating Council also collect gift cards for places such as Best Buy to give to older kids and teens \u2014 an easy addition to a Black Friday purchase.\nThe Volunteers of Burbank Animal Shelter also need donations of canned pet food \u2014 the shelter is at 1150 N. Victory Place, just across from the Empire Center.\nThere are lots of ways to be productive with your Black Friday, but before I take on any of these activities, I plan on sleeping in. I've got a tradition to uphold.\nBRYAN MAHONEY writes about Burbank neighbors and the place they call home. He can be reached at 818NewGuy@gmail.com and on Twitter at @818NewGuy.\n}}

{{\u201cOur business is not like other retail. Our Super Bowl, if you will, is really more the spring season,\u201d explains Marci Grebstein, chief marketing officer at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cIf you think about it from the consumer standpoint, you have people who\u2019ve been hibernating for a good part of the winter, then as soon as you have a couple of warm days, that\u2019s when our busy season starts.\u201d\nWhat that means for Lowe\u2019s is, when it comes to Black Friday, it can experiment a little more than other brands might. This year, that means that tapping the power of Facebook Live to show off deals in a way that feels more like an event than simply picking up the newspaper and looking at the ads. \u201cAs millennials age into first-time home ownership, we know that we\u2019re not reaching them with our circulars on Thanksgiving Day that have all the great Black Friday deals,\u201d Grebstein says. \u201cWe needed to find a way to engage not just with the older millennials, but with people differently. We really focused our brand architecture this year around three components: winning the heart, winning the head, and winning the wallet. When we started to look at that, we wanted to see how to drive the traffic, which is the \u2018win the wallet\u2019 part of the strategy, and then where do we want to win the heart, which is the emotional part. And we\u2019re playing very differently in both of those areas. When Facebook Live came about, the idea of being able to interact and comment with the live event was something that we thought could begin to capture people in a very different way.\u201d\nUsing Facebook Live in that way can be a challenge, though. When it comes to Black Friday reveals, people generally want the deal information more than they want to watch a video, which means that Lowe\u2019s had to come up with a way to make this more appealing than just clicking \u201cplay\u201d on a video of someone reading a list of items and prices on a camera. What it looks like here is an event hosted by HGTV\u2019s Property Brothers, Drew and Jonathan Scott, in which they reveal the different products and offers available in the Black Friday promotion. They\u2019ll be doing it through an interactive game in which viewers can interact with the Scott Brothers through voting elements, revealing the items alongside comedy bits and pranks to stretch the event out, and maintain the suspense of each reveal.\nTo generate interest in the event, Lowe\u2019s teased it at the beginning of November in a video also starring the Scott Brothers, among other things, performing magic tricks and playing shell games with cups and giant warehouses boxes. It seems to have worked\u2013so far, 1.4 million viewers have watched\u2013and all of this, Grebstein says, gives Lowe\u2019s the chance to engage customers in new ways, as Black Friday has changed not just for Lowe\u2019s, but for retailers in every space.\n\u201cThe online transaction piece has grown significantly over the years,\u201d Grebstein says. \u201cOur stores are closed on Thanksgiving Day, but consumers can start shopping on Thanksgiving Day on Lowes.com. Because they can start getting those same deals even before the stores open, the Facebook Live event gives people time to actually plan how they\u2019re going to do their shopping. So if there are certain other retailers that feel like they have to get in line at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving night, or at 3 a.m. that morning, we\u2019re allowing them the time to properly plan\u2013they can go online on Thanksgiving Day and buy other items from us, and we\u2019ve seen that online surge on Thanksgiving Day grow tremendously over the last three or four years.\u201d\n}}
{{Pop music fans weren't the only ones mocking Rebecca Black after her 'Friday' video came out -- it turns out the bullying at school got so bad, Black's mom was forced to begin home-schooling her.\nRadar Online reports that on 'Nightline,' Black described the kinds of abuse she received from other students: \"When I walk by they'll start singing ' Friday ' in a really nasally voice. Or, you know, they'll be like, 'Oh hey, Rebecca, guess what day it is?'\"\nBlack's mother, Georgina Marquez, removed her from school, saying she didn't need the extra stress. Black said that even before 'Friday,' she was used to being bullied, which actually made it easier to handle:\n\"I've had a lot of experience with not being liked and all that. I think if I hadn't had to deal with that in the past then I totally would have handled this differently and I would have gone down in burning flames. But I've learned that you just can't let it get to you.\"\nNo matter how bad the song was, bullying someone so much they have to leave school is definitely not cool. But Rebecca is getting the last laugh. In addition to making thousands of dollars from iTunes and YouTube for 'Friday,' Black released a second single, ' My Moment ,' that has racked up more than 22 million views, and she has appeared at awards shows and on stage with Katy Perry .\n}}

Finance reports.\nAt its centers in Bad Hersfeld and Rheinberg in Germany, 620 workers walked out for 24 hours after Germany\u2019s Verdi services union called for a strike.\nWorkers at Spain\u2019s biggest warehouse, located in San Fernando de Henares, also walked out on Friday \u2014 and plan to strike Saturday.\n\u201cWe are entering the end of year spurt, the most stressful time for employees,\u201d said Mechthild Middeke, a spokesperson for Verdi. \u201cEspecially on a day like Black Friday, employees should be the central focus.\u201d\nAmazon Germany says that a majority of employees stayed on the job, and that there would be no delay in customer service. It also defended its pay and worker conditions, saying that it offers competitive pay and benefits, with workers earning an equivalent of $12.23 per hour to start.\nIn Spain, 85 to 90 percent of the employees took part in the walkout according to the local unions. Amazon Spain disputes the numbers, saying that a majority of employees were still at work, processing customer orders.\nA trade union in the United Kingdom also announced a protest against Amazon, saying that the company fosters \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions for warehouse workers. The GMB Union claims that workers are \u201cbreaking bones, being knocked unconscious, and being taken away in ambulances.\u201d\nWe're staging #BlackFriday protests across the UK in anger at the awful conditions people work under at @Amazon warehouses.

At one warehouse with somewhere between 1,800 and 2,000 workers, an ambulance was called 115 times. For comparison, a nearby Tesco with 1,300 workers needed an ambulance just eight times.\nAmazon UK says that its network is \u201cfully operational,\u201d and that \u201cany reports to the contrary are simply wrong.\u201d\nThe company also disputes that working conditions in its warehouses are dangerous or that it is paying out substandard wages in the U.K.\n\u201cAccording to the U.K. Government\u2019s Health and Safety Executive, Amazon has over 40% fewer injuries on average than other transportation and warehousing companies in the U.K.,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage everyone to compare our pay, benefits and working conditions to others and come see for yourself on one of the public tours we offer every day at our centers across the UK.\u201d\nGMB says that workers in Italy will also \u201ctake action\u201d to protest conditions and pay for Black Friday. The union is encouraging other Amazon employees to share their experiences with the company using the hashtag #AmazonWeAreNotRobots.\n}}

{{We\u2019re talking about Singles\u2019 Day, which takes place this Sunday, November 11. Singles\u2019 Day is (also known as \u201cDouble 11\u201d because it takes place on November 11, or 11/11 every year) is a Chinese holiday that began in 1993 and celebrates the pride in being alone, or single. Matter of fact, the reason Singles\u2019 Day falls on November 11 every year is because of the number \u201c1\u201d represents a single person.\nBut since its inception, mainly thanks to Chinese tech giant Alibaba, in the last decade Singles\u2019 Day has blossomed into the largest shopping holiday in the world. 2017\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day brought in $25 billion in sales in just a single 24-hour period, reports CNBC. While most businesses benefit from the holiday in China now, the biggest beneficiary of Singles\u2019 Day is Alibaba. In 2017 the company handled 256,000 transactions per second in the 24-hour period and shipped 775 million parcels.\nBut surely Singles\u2019 Day can\u2019t be bigger than Black Friday, right? Wrong. Singles\u2019 Day dwarfs Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Last year Black Friday online sales hit $5.03 billion, and Cyber Monday sales hit $6.59 billion\u2013less than half of what Singles\u2019 Day brought in on, well, a single day.\n}}
{{A respondent to a Pew Research Center survey a couple years back said, \u201cIf the news is important, it will find me,\u201d highlighting the importance of social media \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, etc. \u2013 in delivering content in the future.\nSome of you may have seen this stat from Pew this week: 30 percent of Americans didn\u2019t know how the Supreme Court ruled on the Affordable Care Act.\nNow, my guess is few, if any, of those 30 percent are a news provider\u2019s target demographic on any platform, but think about how many people around you knew what had happened minutes after the ruling. Where did you find out about the ruling? Was it on your phone? Through Twitter? A friend at the office?\nWhat we\u2019re aiming to be in our new company, Alabama Media Group, is the start of that information flow that you can use, specifically around local and state issues. Then, in our new print editions, provide more analysis and context about recent news developments.\nA point that tends to get lost is that despite our print product being somewhat stagnant from a circulation perspective, more people read our content and advertising than at any time in our history because of digital.\nThat\u2019s a powerful position to be in, and while transitioning to Wednesday, Friday and Sunday printed newspapers is a difficult change in habit, it reflects where our audience is headed.\nOn to this week\u2019s questions:\nQ What happens to special holiday papers like the Thanksgiving papers which carry Black Friday ads? And what about having print papers of 9/11 anniversary and 4/27 anniversary? I used to enjoy the Christmas papers with letters to Santa.\n\u2013 Susan\nA Excellent question, Susan. We have already decided that we should provide a paper on Thanksgiving, even though it\u2019s a Thursday, and we are reviewing the case for a Christmas day paper, which this year falls on a Tuesday.\nIn short, we know there are special days when readers want a paper, either because of the content or advertising. If Alabama or Auburn are in a national championship game on a Monday, for example, we know we have to be organized to publish a paper (and if Northern Illinois University makes it to a national championship, I\u2019ll personally make sure we\u2019re ready to print, although that may have more to do with the coming apocalypse than any news value pertaining to my alma mater).\nWe\u2019ll be ready to print when news developments warrant, such as those national championships or a disaster like the April 27 tornadoes. For example, in Huntsville, which went without electricity for five days after the storms, I would have strongly advocated printing every day without power, and I expect we would have done that.\nQ I want to hold a newspaper in my hands every morning as I drink my coffee and find out the latest news in our area and the world. I am also an avid reader of TIME magazine on which I will continue to depend for my national and world news as well as NBC nightly news for daily updates. I am hoping that someone else will come along and start a local daily paper so I can cancel my subscription to the 3 day a week excuse for a newspaper. Based on other letters that have been in the papers in Birmingham, you all have underestimated and misunderstood your customer as most of us would have been happy to pay more to continue with a daily newspaper. Alas, it appears no one asked your customers how they feel. \u2013 Sally\nA I chose your letter, Sally, because it hits on several important points as to why we are making these changes. The printed paper cannot compete with digital for providing the \u201clatest\u201d news. So, we believe we should build it around analysis and thought-provoking content, and allow digital to continue to grow as the breaking news vehicle. You say you read TIME and watch the nightly news. This highlights the challenge we face as people have more options to turn to for their particular needs.\nThe flip side to that, of course, is that folks can go through their entire day and only hear what they want to hear. It\u2019s one of my biggest fears for how we evolve in the Internet era as an informed citizenry \u2013 you can follow only what you want to, whether that\u2019s based on your politics, religion, whatever. Despite the simple one-liners from politicians and talk show hosts, we in journalism strive for unbiased news coverage that can be relied upon for accurate, honest discussion. But we live in a time when too often we can\u2019t even agree on facts. Think about what that means.\nSo, we must remain committed to the truth, and our reinvention is intended to ensure that unbiased reporting is sustainable as a business and available across all platforms.\nWhich gets to your point about asking our customers how they feel -- they\u2019re telling us every day how they feel through their clicks and subscription rates. Monday and Tuesday papers are not our biggest drivers of circulation or revenue, especially compared to Wednesday, Friday or, absolutely, Sunday. Furthermore, Monday and Tuesday are on average our two highest-traffic days at al.com.\nWe know there are people who love the seven-day experience. But we are living in a time of great technological disruption, and we have to evolve in this environment. These changes build on what we\u2019ve learned about our audience.\nKevin Wendt is editor of The Huntsville Times. He will be vice president of content for Alabama Media Group.

{{A Target store in Raleigh was practically empty, while a Tallahassee Best Buy had crowds that were no bigger than any other Friday.\nBlack Friday crowds failed to turn up in at least two U.S. cities, and more than one retail analyst is convinced that the shopping holiday is slowly becoming a thing of the past.\nFor years now, Black Friday \u2014 the unofficial opening of the Christmas shopping season \u2014 has been the scene of huge crowds, lines down the street, and even people camping out overnight in order to snag once-in-a-lifetime deals. So extreme have been the excesses of Black Friday that more than one store has seen the crowds divulge into verbal altercations, fistfights, or even riots.\nAnd in a couple of places, at least, it seems that the enthusiasm for black Friday may be waning.\nIn Raleigh, North Carolina, for example, shoppers are posting pictures on social media of largely-empty stores.\nLee Hilts tells WDTV (Raleigh-Durham) that he\u2019s all about Black Friday.\n\u201cI do a little bit of research every Wednesday morning to see what I want to get.\u201d\nHowever, when he went to his favorite big-box retailer in Raleigh in the wee hours of Friday morning, armed with his knowledge of Black Friday deals cross-referenced with his wife and daughters\u2019 Christmas lists \u2014 and accompanied by a WDTV reporter \u2014 he didn\u2019t find the pandemonium that he expected. Instead, he found a mostly-empty store.\nThe situation was similar over in Tallahassee. WTXL-TV (Tallahassee) reporter Jada Williams went to a local Best Buy to get a live shot of the Black Friday crowds. There weren\u2019t any. Instead, there was a crew of workers, sweeping up and getting the store ready for a normal day of business. At this point it bears noting, however, that Williams was there hours before store opening. Although there were no long lines \u2014 or people camping out at the time \u2014 they may yet have shown up in force by the time of this writing.\nIn fact, Black Friday may be slowly winding down \u2014 at least, from its peak craziness of a couple of years ago. That\u2019s the opinion of Vox writer Gaby Del Valle.\nShe writes that a few things have contributed to the beginning of the end of the unofficial holiday. The first is the fact that retailers are expanding Black Friday sales and hours into Thanksgiving Day itself \u2014 much to the annoyance of many Americans who fear that it encroaches on the traditional family time. Another is the emergence of so-called \u201cCyber Monday,\u201d when online retailers roll out deals for shoppers who would rather not leave the comfort of their home.\nHowever, it bears noting that elsewhere across the U.S. today, other stores have been inundated with Black Friday shoppers as per usual. So while Black Friday may or may not be past its prime, it still has a long way to go before it\u2019s over.\n}}

{{I know what you are thinking, the 2012 holiday season is more than eight months away. That's a lifetime for many of us, but not for brands. For these businesses, March and April are when the teams put together their game plan for the season that this year will kick off one day early.\nWith that , let's look at some of areas that marketers should consider for the upcoming season. First, as I alluded to above, they must be ready to begin the holiday push earlier. How much earlier?\nTraditionally, Black Friday has served as the launching point of the season with brands focusing all their energy on that day. However in 2011 we learned that Thanksgiving Day doesn't just kick off holiday football, but also the quest to find the best deals. Last year sales on Thanksgiving grew by nearly 40 percent over the previous year. Translation? There is a huge amount at stake on that day, a day that traditionally was spent enjoying a meal with friends and family. With the day expanding to include a post-meal course of online shopping, retailers must plan to target the Turkey Day shopper with compelling offers while building a plan that sustains interest into Black Friday, over the weekend and into on Cyber Monday.\nWhen it comes to targeting shoppers, one method retailers should be considering are QR codes. It's true that QR codes have not lived up to their promise thus far, but one year ago we were saying the same thing about the mobile shopper. My point is that today the mobile stars are aligned and QR codes are ready to deliver. Retailers that embrace this technology now may be the ones making front-page news with their customers.\nBeyond mobile, another area that is picking up momentum is social media. Last fall I spoke to far too many retailers who discounted the notion that social shopping could make significant contributions to their bottom lines. Others just threw up their hands in frustration, saying something along the lines of \"I just don't understand how to use it to drive revenue.\"\nThese are the kinds of perspectives that drive retailers out of business. The fact is that the internet has evolved from a click-based experience to a people-based experience, where the opinions for your networks matter most. Perhaps my colleague Yuchun Lee put it best when he said that social media is like \"truth serum\" for businesses.\nWith that , huddle up with your team and start asking how plugged in are you to the social channels. Are you looking at how your customers are behaving on social media? Not just Facebook and Twitter, but other sites across the Web and even your own site where consumers frequently post comments about their shopping experiences. Next, are you able to identify patterns in how consumers are sharing specials and promotions within their networks which you can replicate and amplify in 2012?\nIn addition to social buying and sharing patterns, you should be examining social sentiment. In recent posts I have discussed this concept in depth so I won't delve into all the details, other than to say that now is the time to shift the focus from the social sentiment of the Superbowl champion New York Giants and the Oscars to the sentiment of your brand online. Examine how consumers perceive your company. What are you saying? Which of your products or campaigns are generating the most buzz? Is there any negative discussion? If so, what are they saying and can you fix it now? These insights are huge and can help you predict your customers' buying behavior and avoid any potential mishaps.\nThe way consumers shop has certainly changed in recent times, with buyers consistently shopping across channels. With that , it's time that business leaders investigate how customers interact with their brand through a new lens. This insight will allow businesses to not only tap into these vibrant conversations, but also determine how best to service these newly empowered customers on their terms. The business leaders who put in the time now to really understand their customers might be the brands I end up talking your ear off about this time next year.\n}}
{{Black Friday numbers are strong across the board, according to initial reports coming in today from retailers and payments companies. As IBM reported earlier today, total online sales saw a surge of 20.7 percent in spending from last year. eBay-owned PayPal is reporting that Black Friday global mobile payments volume was up 193 percent from last year.\neBay is also reporting a major increase in transactions; total mobile volume in the U.S. was up 153 percent, and GSI Commerce saw a 198 percent jump in mobile sales.\nPayPal spokesperson Anuj Nayar says that the payments giant believes that this is the year where holiday shopping on mobile devices has gone mainstream. Yesterday, shoppers in Houston made the most purchases via PayPal using mobile phones. For the previous three years, New York City has taken the top spot.\nFor Thanksgiving, eBay saw a 133 percent increase in mobile volume transacted; and PayPal saw a 173 percent increase. While more shoppers are hitting their phones and tablets for sales on Thanksgiving, it\u2019s also apparent that consumers are perhaps forgoing the malls and stores for mobile shopping on Black Friday, as well.\nIBM says department stores saw online sales grow by 16.8 percent over Black Friday 2011. And mobile sales reached 16.3 percent of total sales for Black Friday. Design-focused e-commerce site Fab says that sales were up 300% yesterday vs 2011. And mobile sales tripled vs. last year.\nNext up is Cyber Monday, which is also expected to see strong growth in mobile as more consumers use their phones at work to purchase items.\n}}
{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nIt's a blessed time of year, when \"we all give thanks for our families and our health and prepare to beat the shit out of people to go shopping.\" So, noting several instances of highly publicized racial profiling in recent weeks, Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams (who would be a sweet choice for Jon Stewart's heir apparent, should the time come) offered up some genuinely helpful shopping tips last night: how to go shopping on Black Friday when you're black.\n\"It's hard to take advantage of all the Black Friday steals when you are accused of stealing,\" Williams quipped while interviewing black shoppers on the street about their own experiences with racism.

{{Credit card companies such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), American Express (NYSE:AMX), and Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) have a big problem: Americans don't want to carry balances.\nJust look at this chart, which shows revolving credit card balances since the Great Recession:\nIt turns out consumers just aren't interested at borrowing at rates as high as 20% per year. Can you blame them? After all, paying interest on a credit card is one of the worst financial mistakes you could ever make. For the credit card companies, though, lower balances cut into profits.\nHow the industry is coping with lower balances\nThis year, credit card companies are upping the ante to put their cards in your wallet. Discover offers its customers 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in online purchases from October to Dec. 1. American Express is working with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to give away free Amazon Prime accounts to customers who sign up for its cards.\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) promised its Chase Freedom customers 5% cash back at Amazon and \"select department stores.\"\nThe credit card companies of the world know that the fourth quarter is their time to shine -- their time to grab balances on which they can earn returns topping 20% per year.\nHow their marketing pays off\nAnyone who collects 5% cash back or a free Amazon Prime account this year will benefit at the card company's expense, provided they pay off their balances on the next due date. Those who carry balances will help make the businesses -- and their shareholders -- even wealthier.\nBut these marketing plans aren't a one-off opportunity to grab balances. These promotions can pay dividends for years to come.\nLet's use Discover as an example. The company reported that it paid a rewards rate of 0.98% in the third quarter, or about $273 million to customers who use its credit cards.\nHowever, it generated revenue of $550 million on total transaction volume of $77.4 billion across its network in the same period. That amounts to an average take of about 0.7% on all transactions. It also earned about $1.5 billion in interest on $50 billion in credit card balances.\nDiscover would love to give away $273 million to generate more than $2 billion in fee and interest revenue over and over again. It's an investment the company would love to make hundreds of times per year.\nCreating a perpetual revenue stream\nThere's an obvious reason credit card companies want you to use their cards online. Once used, retailers save credit card information for future use. At Amazon, for instance, I have three different cards plugged in to my account. When I make a purchase and pick a card to use, the credit card company gets a balance. If it's a Discover or American Express card, they also get the transaction fees.\nSo, for a small upfront investment, credit card companies can earn processing fees and gather balances in perpetuity. While Discover, American Express, and JPMorgan may lose money initially on heavy promotional activity, they secure their place in your account at department-store sites scattered around the Internet.\nEach time you shop, your trusty credit card will be preloaded, ready to use. And for the credit card companies, that's a huge advantage in growing their market share. The more places they can encourage you to spend, the more likely you are to use their cards in the future.\nSure, all these promotions come at a cost, but it's hard to see how aggressive promotions today won't lead to big balances -- and big profits -- for years and years. American Express and Discover have an advantage on most credit card issuers, as they get paid twice when their cards are used: first on the transaction fees, and again when interest accrues on carried balances. The others just collect interest on the balances.\n}}
{{Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) is no best-seller after having released fiscal second-quarter earnings. This is a sad story, indeed. Given Black Friday's approach, this is a week during which we think about retail -- and, as investors, retail stocks -- the most, and Barnes & Noble isn't adding holiday cheer.\nBlack Friday is a holiday quarter highlight each and every year, but investors might wonder how badly Barnes & Noble will struggle on that red-letter shopping day... and beyond.\nLosing the plot\nThe big-box bookstore has outlasted Borders, but it's been harder pressed to thrive in the bookselling business as time goes on. Barnes & Noble did manage to cut its quarterly expenses in order to increase its profit. The retailer's second-quarter net income spiked to $13.2 million, or $0.15 per share, after having reported a negligible increase in net income and a loss of $0.07 per share this time last year.\nHowever, investors can read nastiness in Barnes & Noble's revenue. Its retail segment revenue, which doesn't include the Nook, fell 7.5% to $921 million, and same-store sales dropped 3.7%. The tidings reflect a negative trifecta: store closures and deteriorating Internet sales, not to mention a drop in actual human beings in the stores.\nIn an interesting aside that says a lot about the bookselling business's reliance on best-sellers, this quarter didn't include the temporary boost of last year's Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. That adds a little extra whipping to the numbers.\nNot that long ago, Barnes & Noble had managed to outdo and survive Borders by jumping swiftly and competently into an area that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) had sparked with its Kindle: e-readers and e-books. The Nook was a real contender as Borders struggled with its financials and staggered into the e-reader market by offering the Kobo e-reader device. (Once Borders went belly-up, Kobo went solo.)\nThe Nook was going strong for a while, shining like a crown jewel in Barnes & Noble's challenged brick-and-mortar business. Today, Barnes & Noble's traction is deteriorating in its physical bookstores and in the Nook business. Its digital content sales have fallen 21%, and its market share in e-books has fallen to about 20% from 27% a year ago.\nEarlier this year, one investing thesis hinged high hopes on Barnes & Noble's future, at least in terms of the Nook. Recall the thrill at the concept that Microsoft could purchase the Nook business in full; it already owns a stake.\nOf course, there's a small problem for long-term investors. In that case, Barnes & Noble would have very little left in its core business, so a bull thesis was of the super-speculative, lottery-ticket nature. Still, that possibility hasn't come to pass yet. And obviously, the Nook is looking worse for the wear at this point.\nWar and peace of mind\nMany investors mock an Amazon investment, talking about its ridiculous valuations and lack of profitability. Granted, Amazon's bottom line is a risk to be aware of, but sales volume actually is astronomically impressive.\nLast year, Amazon generated sales growth of 27% to $61 billion. Amazon is no one-trick pony. It can push e-books and e-readers, physical books, and even help authors cut out the middleman of traditional publishing because its diversification is, in a word, epic. It's Tolstoy-esque.\nIn fiscal 2012, Barnes & Noble's sales fell 4% to $6.8 million. Barnes & Noble is a one-trick pony (with a few decorations like trinkets and odds and ends). It's the equivalent to War and Peace CliffsNotes, but not even as compelling a purchase. (War and Peace is a classic, but not the easiest great book to read.)\nBarnes & Noble's Black Friday story illustrates plenty of reasons for investors to avoid the stock. Maybe I'm adding a surprising plot twist, but despite Amazon shares' pricy reputation, investors should contemplate its addition to their holiday stock watch list. It's one of the truly great disruptive, visionary companies.\nIs Amazon.com a buy right now? Maybe not, depending on whether individual investors feel nervous about buying high-quality stocks for the distant future, and riding years of ups and downs. Cheaper prices on the stock will likely be had, too; over the course of Amazon's history, investors and analysts have had a history of flipping out about its margins and profitability concerns, resulting in occasional stock beat-downs. After the holidays, as with late gift-shopping, investors may get a deal.\nAmazon is most definitely a hold for those already lucky enough to own it -- and willing to ride some stock price roller-coaster rides over the long haul.\nBarnes & Noble is an example of an opposite type of stock: a Black Friday dud for those window-shopping for retail stocks and, given the uncertainty, hardly any bargain. Its fundamental business is a sad story that will likely not have a happy ending.\n}}
{{The two big shopping days also revealed some new trends in the retail industry.\nThe Black Friday and Cyber Monday numbers are in, and if these early indications of the Christmas shopping season are any indication, it\u2019s going to be a banner year for retailers, some of whom rely on the Christmas season for up to half of their annual bottom line.\nAs Adobe Analytics reports, Cyber Monday 2018 was not only the biggest Cyber Monday in history, it was the biggest single-day retail shopping day in U.S. history. Approximately $7.9 billion changed hands on that day, shattering the previous year\u2019s marks by 19.7 percent.\nJohn Copeland, head of Marketing and Customer Insights at Adobe, says that part of the increase \u2013 $2 billion worth \u2013 comes from shoppers using mobile apps on their smartphones or tablets to purchase Christmas gifts rather than the old-fashioned method of online shopping: browsing on your laptop or desktop computer.\nEven so, the day could have been even bigger if not for technical glitches, according to retail industry trade publication Multibriefs. Several users on high-profile sites such as Amazon were hit with \u201cout-of-stock\u201d messages. Other websites, such as those of Lowes, Target, and PayPal, all went down for periods of time on Cyber Monday.\nThat\u2019s not good, says retail analyst Rob Strechay.\n\u201cEvery minute of downtime can equate to tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue on a normal day. We all know this is much higher during the holiday shopping season.\u201d\nAjgul / Shutterstock\nAs for shoppers who prefer to do their shopping in person at brick-and-mortar stores, Black Friday 2018 was something of a mixed bag.\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, some Southern cities, such as Tallahassee and Raleigh, reported all-but-nonexistent Black Friday crowds at some locations. Where the day had once been a free-for-all, in some places descending into riots, in a couple of cities the day was no different than any other Friday.\nSo is the madness that is Black Friday becoming a thing of the past?\nThe numbers both do and don\u2019t bear that out. Black Friday sales across the country were off from the previous year, but only by 2 percent.\nMeanwhile, Black Friday and Cyber Monday\u2019s numbers also reveal the popularity of a new trend in the retail industry, one that combines the best of both worlds. BOPIS, as it\u2019s called in the industry \u2013 Buy Online, Pickup In Store \u2013 allows customers the convenience of shopping online while simultaneously saves them shipping charges and allows them to skip (mostly) the crowds. Roughly 50 percent more shoppers utilized this option than in 2017, and retailers that offer BOPIS saw 28 percent more use of the feature than in 2017.\nRetailers are optimistic that these trends point to a huge Christmas shopping season this year.\n}}
{{More South Africans are expected to shop online this Black Friday than ever before.\nBlack Friday sales this week are expected to draw more South Africans online than ever before, with local e-commerce players expecting to double their earnings from last year.\nInstead of facing hordes of people in traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, the trend over the years has seen price-conscious South Africans increasingly choose to rather scramble for deals online.\nBlack Friday, which takes place this Friday, is traditionally the day after Thanksgiving in North America, which marks the day when retailers move into profitable territory (the black). The trend has been embraced globally in recent years and is regarded as the start of the festive shopping season.\nArthur Goldstuck, World Wide Worx MD, says: \"The appeal of Black Friday lies entirely in ridiculous prices. The unspoken deal is that shoppers will get a quarter, third or half off the price of a product. Many people who are in the market for a specific product that falls under Black Friday deals will wait for the day to try to get the same product they were going to buy anyway, but at a substantially lower price.\"\nHe says Black Friday shopping online is probably doubling every year, \"versus overall online retail going up by 25% a year, according to the Online Retail in South Africa 2019 report that World Wide Worx released at the beginning of November. It could reach half a billion rand this year, if we include the so-called Cyber Monday that follows.\"\nAccording to the report, only around 4% of South Africans shop online regularly, although Goldstuck says far more do so on an ad hoc basis.\nHe says those consumers who are regular online shoppers will stay away from stores completely, and only shop online.\n\"Many other shoppers, who have been reticent to shop online, will be persuaded to try it out both by the madness in malls and by the superb deals being offered online. This should result in a big boost in the number of South Africans shopping online.\"\nTakealot CMO Julie-Anne Walsh.\nLucrative business\nJulie-Anne Walsh, CMO at Takealot, says within the first hour of Black Friday 2017, there was a 280% year-on-year uplift in visits to the site, generating more than R6 million. In total, for the whole day, there was a record number of 2.2 million visits, with the company making R87 million in gross merchandising value (GMV) compared to R56 million in 2016.\nShe anticipates the growth to continue this year. \"We expect to see a 75% increase in traffic during Black Friday 2018 and 2.2x growth in terms of GMV.\"\nThis means a GMV of more than R175 million is expected on Friday for Takealot, in a single day of sales.\nKlyne Maharaj, head of brand at Superbalist, one of SA's largest online fashion retailers, says last year's Black Friday (before the firm's merge with Spree) was its biggest trading day to date, with 118% year-on-year growth and double 2016's sales figures.\n\"Since Superbalist.com first took part in Black Friday in 2014, sales and traffic have more than doubled each year. This year, Black Friday comes just two months after the merge with Spree and so we expect to see an even bigger increase considering the newly joined Spree database of customers.\"\nBidorbuy CEO Jaco Jonker says: \"We believe consumer interest will be at its highest this year. Black Fridays are traditionally exceptionally high, and this year we expect better results than ever.\"\nJohn Bradshaw, head of marketing at Pick n Pay, says the retailer's online shop will launch its Black Friday deals at 00.01am on 23 November, when there will be selected online-only deals.\n\"For a convenient and stress-free Black Friday shopping experience, we invite customers to shop online. For Black Friday weekend we have added additional delivery and Click n Collect slots to minimise any delays in customers receiving their Black Friday purchases.\"\nWorld Wide Worx MD Arthur Goldstuck.\nStaying up\nLast year, Takealot and other online retailers struggled to keep their sites up as overwhelming volumes of people tried to score a deal at the same time.\n\"Over the past year, we have prepared intensively for Black Friday,\" says Takealot's Walsh. \"We've bolstered resources across the business, from our engineers and developers to customer service shopping assistants and warehouse staff, and have increased our Takealot delivery team drivers from 1 300 to 3 000, to manage the increase in volume.\n\"In terms of online infrastructure, we've looked at all options to ensure an excellent experience and efficient management of traffic to the site over the period.\"\nSuperbalist's Maharaj says the team is also taking every possible measure to keep the site up.\n\"Our engineering team is preparing ahead of Black Friday, testing our systems rigorously to pre-empt any possible issues that may arise. If the site does go down, we will have contingencies that allow customers to shop Black Friday deals in the subsequent days.\"\nParcelninja CEO Justin Drennan expects a 500% spike in sales this Friday.\n\"Many online shopping sites' IT infrastructure buckles under the load, and payment providers often struggle with the high number of transactions,\" says Drennan.\nHowever, he says the biggest problem is deliveries. The delivery company has geared up for the increased demand by employing more staff over the period, scaling up servers, and investing in advanced IT systems that allocate deliveries across multiple couriers, based on load and delivery volume commitments from couriers.\n\"This means that we never end up giving too much volume to a single courier, which can cause delivery problems.\"\nLast year, the top-selling category for Takealot was TVs, followed by small kitchen appliances, cellphones and wearable tech.\nMaharaj says women's fashion was the most popular category sold last year, followed by sneakers, with the most in demand product being the Adidas Originals Superstar Foundation in black and white.\n\"In keeping with the Black Friday themes, we also found the most popular colour across all products sold was... black!\"\n}}
{{It appears that Microsoft had a nice Thanksgiving holiday \u2014 at least in terms of Xbox One sales numbers.\nRetail analytics firm InfoScout analyzed 180,000 user-submitted receipts and reported that the Xbox One made up 53 percent of all consoles sold on Black Friday, compared to 31 percent for Sony\u2019s Playstation 4. The Xbox 360 came in third with 9 percent market share; the Wii U was fourth at 6 percent; and the PS3 had a 1 percent share.\nInfoScout also found that 66 percent of those receipts were from parents purchasing a console for their kids. Of those who bought Nintendo\u2019s Wii U, 92 percent said they were buying the device for their children, compared to 66 percent for Xbox One buyers and 45 percent for PS4.\nIn addition, the firm also noted the popularity of bundle deals. Microsoft offered a handful of Xbox One packages, including games like Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity and Halo: The Master Chief Collection with the console itself, while Sony sold its own bundles.\nMicrosoft also slashed the price of the Xbox One to $329 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. That was $70 cheaper than the currently advertised price for the PlayStation 4, and $20 cheaper than the holiday price Microsoft announced last month.\nMicrosoft debuted the Xbox One in November 2013 for $499, which was $100 more than the PS4. The PS4, which has stayed at $399 since launch, has outsold the Xbox One in the U.S. for the past nine months \u2014 but perhaps the Black Friday sales can help Microsoft end Sony\u2019s streak.\n}}
{{How\u2019s this for an opener? \u201cMore Americans will be shopping this year on Black Friday,\u201d divines Reuters, \u201cor at least that\u2019s how it looks from outer space.\u201d No, that\u2019s not a dispatch from the news wire\u2019s Martian correspondent: it\u2019s a report on satellite photos being used to gauge the state of the U.S. consumer economy.\nScientists often talk of \u201cproxies\u201d: you measure one thing to get an indication of another. In this case, the proxies for shopping activity are cars parked outside shopping malls\u2013visible in satellite photos from Remote Sensing Metrics. Fully 35% of parking spots have been filled since the middle of September this year; that figure was just 31% and 32% in the previous two years. On the Saturday before Black Friday (i.e. four days ago) this year, 42.3% of parking spots were filled, versus just 36.5% in 2009 and 30.6% in 2008.\nTranslation: the alien\u2019s-eye view of the economy looks good this year.\nSometimes, however, clogged parking lots don\u2019t necessarily translate into higher retail sales. In 2008, for instance, there were a lot of customers elbowing each other at the shopping malls\u2013but the actual amount of money spent was less than in year prior, since the busted economy had forced retailers to slash prices. But since an analyst tells Reuters that \u201cprices could be higher this year on groceries and luxury goods,\u201d the stuffed parking lots could well mean big money this year \u2014 when it comes to luxury goods, that is. The day after Thanksgiving is the one day a year when you are least likely to need groceries.\nWhen scientists use proxies, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have access to more immediate forms of measurement. For our part, we\u2019ll forego the measurements from outer space, and wait for the direct sales data, coming soon to a mall near you.\n[Image: Flickr user marc_smith]\n}}
{{By Rita R. Robison\nThousands of shoppers will be crowding Seattle-area stores on Black Friday, and even Thanksgiving Day, to find deals on gifts and services.\nBut, you need to be on the lookout for deals that aren\u2019t deals and scammers who want trick you and steal your money.\nDeals vary and often reading the fine print is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself.\nBefore you go shopping and get caught up in the frenzy, the Better Business Bureau offers the following tip to help you save time and money:\nTip 1 \u2013 Know before you go\nBefore Black Friday, many retailers will release their deals online, in social media, and in other publications. Research where the sales are and make a list of your gift priorities to compare prices and plan your day of deals. Since many advertisements will begin before the actual sale, build up a coupon collection as soon as possible. Bring the ads with you on Black Friday to make sure you\u2019re getting the deal you expected.\nTip 2 \u2013 Don\u2019t fall for false advertising\nSome companies resort to advertisements that are untrue, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent. Be sure to watch for red flags.\nYou could lose money if you\u2019re lured by prices too good to be true, bait-and-switch ads designed to bring you in but push you toward more expensive items, fine print return policies, final sales, and deals that end before the day is done. Do your own research to confirm the claims being made.\nTip 3 \u2013 Maximize advance alerts\nSign up for the email alerts from your favorite retailers and \u201clike\u201d their Facebook page.\nTip 4 \u2013 Bring your reward cards\nBlack Friday deals may have strict restrictions. Make sure you have reward cards with your favorite stores and keep them with you.\nTip 5 \u2013 Shop with trust\nIf you find a deal, don\u2019t jump at the first chance to get it. Do research on the business \u2013 know how long it\u2019s been in business, look into their customer service track record, and check them out at bbb.org. If you have concerns about the type of gift or the right fit, make sure you ask about the return policy.\nTip 6 \u2013 Comparative shop online\nDozens of Black Friday websites claim to have the best deals. Be sure the sites you use are reputable by checking them out at bbb.org. In addition, see what others say about the site through an online search.\nYou also need to find out if the site is secure and be certain you have a phone number and physical address if problems come up with your order.\nTip 7 \u2013 Look for QR codes\nThey\u2019re a black-and-white square that they can take you directly to a deal. QR stands for Quick Response codes, and they\u2019re popping up in many ads and print materials. Before you can scan one and view the offer, you\u2019ll have to install a QR app reader. Most new smart phones are equipped to scan QR codes.\nTip 8 \u2013 Shop small\nCheck your neighborhood retailers for their weekend deals and shop there to support local businesses.\nTip 9 \u2013 Check return and exchange policies\nStores can change their policies at any time. Make sure you know what the return and exchange policy is for your Black Friday special and that a return is possible, especially if you\u2019re buying online. Final sales, a short return window, or in-store or online only credit could ruin your deal.\nTip 10 \u2013 Shop safely\nTake your time and plan ahead for the most rewarding shopping experience:\nMake a list and prioritize where you should go and when.\nShop with friends to help sort through the options, take two cars so shoppers can go in two directions to get limited quantities, and take turns waiting in line and shopping.\nRemember to get gift receipts and keep them organized.\nFor more information for boomer consumers, see my blog The Survive and Thrive Boomer Guide.\n}}
{{(TIME)\u2013 The widely growing card game, Cards Against Humanity, followed suit with the inappropriate yet light-hearted attitude of it\u2019s players as the company sold actual bull poop as a rebellion against Black Friday.\nCards Against Humanity is a fill-in-the-blank party game where players try to one up each other with phrase cards ranging from merely politically incorrect to legitimately disgusting, according to Time.com.\nFor a sweet deal of only $6, costumers who went online to purchase a game received a sleekly designed box with a nice little heap of literal bull poop, appropriately called \u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cWe all really hate Black Friday, it\u2019s just kind of a horrible day,\u201d says game co-creator Max Temkin.\nHe continues, \u201cIt comes after this day where you\u2019re supposed to be thankful for what you have, and then it\u2019s just this whole huge media spectacle of people fighting each other to save $50 on a TV.\u201d\nSo CAH decided to stick it to the man.\nThe company pulled all of its products off its site to only sell \u201cBullshit\u201d \u2014 which Temkin says sold out in less than two hours.\nAccording to Time.com, this isn\u2019t the company\u2019s first stunt \u2014 for last year\u2019s Black Friday, the game was sold for $5 above the normal price.\nYou\u2019ve gotta love the mischievous nature of it all.\nAll they did to pull off the stunt was find a cattle ranch somewhere out in Texas that sold pasteurized bull feces for shipments, and sell the box by simply writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the same manufacturer that does packaging for Apple!\u201d\nTime.com says LAist journalists broke the poop apart to see if there was hidden inside, only to find that it was simply feces.\nEven though the promotion is over, some people are selling their \u201cBullshit\u201d packages on eBay for up to as much as $36.\nAccording to Time.com, Cards Against Humanity made 20 cents on each $6 box of holiday bullshit. The profits will go to Heifer International, a charity that aims to eradicate poverty and hunger by providing livestock to developing communities.\n}}
{{Xbox One got off to a rocky start but has dramatically turned things round to knock PS4 off the podium position in October.\nGamespot have recently announced that Xbox has stolen the best selling crown from the PS4 for the first time since both consoles launched.\nWe don't yet have precise figure but VGCChartz estimates that Microsoft sold 303,000 units in October compared to Sony's 275,000.\nSince launch Xbox One has significantly lagged behind the PS4 partly due to their rather ambitious initial price tag of \u00a3429 compared to the PS4's \u00a3349, meaning most people opted for the cheaper option.\nHowever Xbox have hit back at PlayStation releasing more and more exclusive titles such as: Halo 5, Forza and the new Rise of Tomb Raider game which fans will be able to grab a year earlier than PlayStation users.\nWith Halo 5 being the best selling game of October, Microsoft likely raked in eager Halo fans heading down to the shops to pick up a bundle deal.\nAnother factor putting Microsoft back in the running is that they've finally slahed the price of the console with a game to around \u00a3299.99, (which is exactly the same price as PS4).\nFor PS4 to hit back they'll need a better line-up of exclusive games and a price cut on the unit to lure people back towards Sony.\n}}
{{Black Friday, rest in peace.\nThe day as it once was is no more. People still shop on the Friday after Thanksgiving, and some even get up really early to fight for doorbuster deals, but the frenzy has ended. You can blame the death of Black Friday partly on holiday creep. What used to be one day now officially starts on Thanksgiving evening or earlier, which takes away urgency, but the real culprit is online retail.\nA record $4.45 billion was expected to be spent online between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to research from Adobe. Thenumbers broke down to $2.72 billion on Black Friday, 14% more than in 2014, and $1.73 billion on Thanksgiving Day, a 25% increase over last year.\nThose numbers show a shift in overall shopping habits from physical retailers to digital ones. That data was reaffirmed by the National Retail Federation's Thanksgiving Weekend Survey, which showed that nearly 102 million people said they shopped in stores over the Thanksgiving holiday period, and more than 103 million said they shopped online.\nThere was clearly significant overlap between the two. The survey found that more than 151 million people said they shopped either in stores and/or online over the weekend.\n\"We recognize the Thanksgiving weekend shopping experience is much different than it used to be as just as many people want that unique, exclusive online deal as they do that in-store promotion,\" said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay in a press release. \"It is clear that the age-old holiday tradition of heading out to stores with family and friends is now equally matched in the new tradition of looking online for holiday savings opportunities.\"\nThat trend helped define which companies did well in the fast-changing retail landscape. Here's a look at the winners from this year's Black Friday (and we mean that term to broadly cover Thanksgiving as well).\nAmazon is the king\nClearly a shift from bricks-and-mortar retailers to online ones is going to benefit Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The online retailer was also helped by the fact that shoppers were increasingly likely to use mobile phones to make purchases -- about one-third of the nearly $4.5 billion in digital sales was generated by phones. That trend almost certainly helps Amazon because of its one-click purchases and enormous database of registered users with credit cards on file, who can buy very easily.\nAmazon was expected to win the season even before it started, but what it actually sold may make the company even stronger in the long run.\nThe company's biggest seller over the sales holiday was its own Fire 7-inch tablet, according to research from InfoScout, which also showed that the $50 device being sold for $34.99 topped Best Buy's (NYSE: BBY) sales as well. That's great news for the company because every Fire tablet sold creates a new mini-storefront for the company, which will generate app, movie, music, and more sales for years to come.\nWal-Mart and Target look to be strong, too\nBoth Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) shifted their Black Friday strategies from focusing on in-store sales to also pushing customers online. That likely helped both chains (neither of which has released sales data yet) minimize the impact of the fact that fewer people are coming out to stores than in previous years.\n\"We've said this Black Friday would be the most integrated between Walmart stores and Walmart.com -- and we delivered,\" Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies said in a Black Friday press release. He also noted that the company's investment in its digital offering also helped its retail stores. \"More than 25 million customers accessed store maps and the circular through our online and mobile tools for Black Friday,\" he added.\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell also released a press release lauding \"record online sales and strong in-store traffic.\"\nNeither company released any real numbers, and nobody would expect them to come out and declare failure, but their statements make sense given changing shopping habits. Both retailers have invested heavily in their websites and apps, which has led to increasing digital sales overall. There is reason to believe that would pay off during the holiday shopping season.\nWal-Mart and Target can't stop Amazon from taking sales, but they have showed they can at least hold on to some of their customers who want to shop digitally.\nJ.C. Penney makes a mark\nOne surprising Black Friday winner, J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), is notable just for making it to the 2015 holiday shopping season. There were many who had predicted it would not survive after its disastrous run under CEO Ron Johnson, which ended in his firing in April 2013.\nUnder former CEO Mike Ullman, who took back the post he had lost to Johnson, the company found stability. Now under Ullman's successor, Marvin Ellison, the company entered Black Friday 2015 being rated as the best retailer for Black Friday deals, according to research from WalletHub.\nOffering cheap prices appeared to have paid off for the retailer, at least in the short term, as Forbes cited many social media pictures of lines at J.C. Penney stores as well as people posting positive reaction to the deals being offered. In some ways, JCP is a winner just for being open, but these findings show some positive signs that it may have turned a corner and found its place in the retail world.\n}}

{{\u2018Selma\u2019 director Ava DuVernay is among the Hollywood figures leading a retail boycott this Friday in protest against police brutality in response to the grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cFerguson is a mirror of the past,\u201d DuVernay wrote in an email to TheWrap on Wednesday. \u201cAnd S\u200eelma is a mirror of now.

{{Black Friday, the second most profitable day for US technology retailers after Christmas, is well underway for Apple UK although we've got some slightly disappointing sales - which started earlier today - going on at its online store.\nWe randomly picked some of the best-loved Apple products and managed to get find them at prices that are not only better than Apple's own \"Black Friday\" prices - at least in the UK - but which are likely to remain the same past midnight.\nApple sells the iPod Nano 8GB 5th Generation for \u00a3108, down from \u00a3115. Amazon goes even lower, offering it for \u00a3105.62 including delivery for all the shades except the black one which is \u00a31.16 more expensive. The 16GB version is also a few pounds cheaper than Apple's sales price (\u00a3128 vs \u00a3124.52).\nAmazon yet again defies with lower than Apple MacBook Pro prices. The 13-inch model with a 2.26Ghz Core 2 Duo, 2GB, 160GB hard disk drive and a Nvidia Geforce 9400M costs only \u00a3810.79 delivered. Apple's normal price is \u00a3899 while the \"sales\" price is \u00a3828. Sales, it clearly, isn't.\nOneStopPCShop sells the Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Home and Student Edition for \u00a368.24. Apple sells it for \u00a378 this Friday, down from \u00a389.95. This is still is significantly cheaper than the \u00a3120 that Microsoft is asking in its online store.\nEven the Magic Mouse from Apple can be found cheaper elsewhere. At \u00a351.76, it is more affordable at Lamdatek than anywhere else in the UK. Apple sells it for \u00a355 excluding delivery.\nThe Western Digital 500GB My Passport for Mac is on sale at Apple for \u00a384 (normal price is \u00a399.95). Its PC version costs \u00a369.99 at PC World. The only difference between them is the filesystem which means that users will need to reformat the PC drive for Mac use. Whether this warrants the price difference - \u00a330 is uncertain.\nThe conclusion is to always look elsewhere before buying at Apple (or indeed any company selling their own products - and that includes Dell and Microsoft). Savings can be substantial and are always welcomed especially if you are buying several items in one go.\n}}
{{Amazon has suffered a major data breach that caused customer names and email addresses to be disclosed on its website, just two days ahead of Black Friday.\nThe e-commerce giant said it has emailed affected customers but refused to give any more details on how many people were affected or where they are based.\nThe firm said the issue was not a breach of its website or any of its systems, but a technical issue that inadvertently posted customer names and email addresses to its website.\nIn a short statement, Amazon said: \u201cWe have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.\u201d\nCustomers who received the email were told: \u201cOur website inadvertently disclosed your email address or name and email address due to a technical error. The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action. The impacted customers have been contacted.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cAmazon takes all security-related matters very seriously and your account security is our top priority.

While Black Friday predominantly takes place in the US around the Thanksgiving holiday, hundreds of UK retailers now also take part on what has become a multi-billion pound shopping day.\nRichard Walters, chief technical officer of cybersecurity firm CensorNet, said those affected should ignore Amazons\u2019s advice and consider changing their passwords.\n\u201cIf the reports are correct, the information leaked \u2013 names and email addresses \u2013 is less significant than some of these other breaches, which saw card details leaked,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it would be wrong to assume that this makes the breach inconsequential. Cyber-criminals can do a lot of damage with a large database of names and emails.\n\u201cA large majority of people still use predictable passwords, and thanks to previous high-profile breaches many people\u2019s passwords are also readily available on the dark web. For cyber-criminals, it then just becomes an exercise in joining the dots.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been affected, make sure you change your passwords quickly.\u201d\n}}

{{Despite a number of online videos showing shoppers rushing through store doors at the stroke of midnight, grabbing haphazardly in an effort to get their hands on discounted items, Black Friday sales were down more than $1 billion this year compared to last.\nSales in brick and mortar stores fell from $11.6 billion in 2014 to $10.4 billion in 2015, TIME reports. That\u2019s an overall 10 percent decrease in sales, a consequence of both stores offering sales days earlier and online sales that allowed consumers to shop from the comfort of their homes, The Guardian notes.\nA big reason for the decline is increased online shopping, as Americans hunt down deals on their smartphones, tablets and computers. Many retailers are also offering bargains long before Thanksgiving, limiting the impact of Black Friday specials. Online retailers have been bombarding customers with email discounts and bargains for weeks. Online sales jumped 14.3% on Friday compared with last year, according to Adobe, which tracked activity on 4,500 retail websites. Email promotions drove 25% more sales compared with 2014, the company said. Brick-and-mortar retailers saw fewer customer visits on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, compared with last year, according to Kevin Kearns, ShopperTrak\u2019s chief revenue officer. \u201cShoppers are researching products ahead of time, targeting their store visits, and arriving in store with the intention of making a purchase,\u201d Kearns said.\nBut the drop in sales could also be contributed to actions across the nation to boycott Black Friday sales. The demonstrations, dubbed Black Out Black Friday and Not One Dime, were sparked by high-profile police brutality cases, including the fatal shooting of a Black Chicago teenager by a White cop. As originally reported by NewsOne, Chicago protestors planned large demonstrations on the city\u2019s Magnificent Mile to disrupt the shopping holiday and present their demands, one of which included the request for a Justice Department probe into the shooting of Laquan McDonald.\nFriday\u2019s demonstrations also highlighted protesters\u2019 other demands, including the resignation of the police commissioner in Chicago over the fatal shooting.\nIt\u2019s unclear just how much of a decrease in sales can be contributed to the activism, but organizers are planning to continue the effort, boycotting Black Friday\u2019s successor, Cyber Monday.\nSt. Louis organization, Hands Up United, is urging the community to withhold the dollar once again to \u201cexpose the real terrorists,\u201d according to a statement sent to NewsOne.\n\u201cAfter participating in Not One Dime, economic resistance during black Friday with several protests, Hands Up United and its supporters are now leading into exposing the real terrorists. It is absolutely critical for us to define state sanctioned violence against people of color from a perspective that accurately holds it\u2019s purveyors accountable. We do not believe in the vilification of poor people from war torn lands. Lawmakers, prosecutors, and other forms of government officials remain idle as underprivileged people of color are executed in record breaking numbers,\u201d the statement read.\nOnline sales this holiday season have raked in more than $2 billion, a 14 percent jump from 2014.\nSOURCE: TIME, The Guardian | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty\nSEE ALSO:\nBLACK OUT FRIDAY: Chicago Protesters Plan Black Friday Demonstration Over Laquan McDonald Death\nEXCLUSIVE: 3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets \u2013 Ahead Of HBO Premiere, Jordan Davis\u2019 Parents Call For Nation To End Racial Bias, Stand Your Ground Laws\nAlso On News One:\n}}

{{Predictions for Black Friday and 2013 holiday sales range from tentative to lackluster, thanks partly to a drop in consumer confidence following the government shutdown. But one thing is certain \u2013 major retailers aren\u2019t taking chances. That means stores opening at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving, holiday ads before Halloween and aggressive layaway programs and discounts through Cyber Monday.\nWith Black Friday turning into Black Weekend, there\u2019s some fear that Small Business Saturday \u2013 a nationwide campaign launched by American Express in 2010 \u2013 may get lost in the blitz, along with the small businesses that can\u2019t afford to slash prices.\nBut there\u2019s a unique opportunity for small businesses, according to Ronald C. Goodstein, Associate Professor of Marketing at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, who specializes in retail and consumer behavior.\n\u201cWith consumer confidence down this year, people will give fewer gifts but more meaningful ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe competitive advantage for small businesses is the ability to provide personalized service. They can help customers pick that thoughtful, relevant gift in a way that Macy\u2019s, Walmart or Target can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe best way for small businesses to win customers, he adds, is to join forces.\nThinking little and local\nPower in unity is what drove Betsy Cross and Will Cervarich to launch Little Boxes, a two-day post-Thanksgiving shopping event in Portland, Ore., that rewards consumers who shop the city's local retailers.\nLittle Boxes was born in 2011, after Cross saw a Black Friday ad for a big-box store opening on Thanksgiving night.\n\u201cIt struck me that you never think about small shops on Black Friday. I thought, \u2018There has to be a way we can band together and be more powerful,\u2019\u201d said Cross, who co-owns the Portland boutique betsy & iya with Cervarich, her husband.\nRelated: How Online Retailers Can Make More Money by Next Week\nThe campaign now unites over 170 businesses, which offer discounts and raffle prizes to customers. It\u2019s also boosted bottom lines, with some store owners reporting as much of a 50% increase in Black Friday sales since joining Little Boxes.\nCervarich adds that the goal isn\u2019t to compete with Black Friday or Small Business Saturday, but rather harness existing buzz. \u201cThere's no question that AmEx\u2019s Small Business Saturday has helped focus the spotlight on small businesses. But one of the reasons we started Little Boxes was because it didn't seem right that shopping locally should come only after you've shopped big boxes.\u201d\nThere are a number of similar initiatives brewing nationwide, including Seattle\u2019s Gift Local Pledge and Dallas/Ft. Worth\u2019s Spend and Win campaign. But even smaller communities are getting big benefits from building their own shop-local holiday campaigns.\nThe city and Chamber of Commerce in Fallon, Nev., created the Live Local Fallon campaign this summer to encourage residents to spend locally, rather than driving to nearby Reno. They\u2019ve recruited 155 businesses to participate in a campaign where shoppers get stamps in a \u201cpassport\u201d that makes them eligible for raffle prizes for every $15 spent. There\u2019s a special push around Black Friday, during which incentives for shoppers will be tripled.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very concerned about the leakage of dollars getting spent outside Fallon,\u201d said Rick Gray, executive director of the Fallon Convention and Tourism Authority. \u201cWe tried educational campaigns and ads. But until we came up with this tangible way to reward residents, we didn't feel the message was hitting home.\u201d\nRelated: Disturbing Crime Trends Facing Retailers (Infographic)\nBut other non-retail small businesses prefer to avoid one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Visit Myrtle Beach is launching Travel Saturday this year. For 24 hours after Black Friday, gift-givers and deal-seekers can book discounted travel, lodging and entertainment for 2014 at participating small businesses in the South Carolina beach community. The idea is to spotlight a travel-centric economy on a day when consumers are likely to be at home, online and less occupied with retail deals.\nAccording to Goodstein, this is the kind of creative thinking and unity that small businesses need to compete.\n\u201cBlack Friday used to delight consumers and offer real deals. Now big companies buy in order to sell at sale price. They compete on lower margins, which means less quality,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall businesses need to work together to lower prices [but keep quality high]. Offer consumers service and something special in a tough economy at a discounted price \u2013 you can\u2019t beat that.\u201d\nRelated: How to Establish Retail Store Policies When Just Starting Out\n}}
{{The Black Friday edition of Record Store Day (which is set in late April) is a sneaky way for independent record stores to get us vinyl nerds out of the house the day after Thanksgiving to buy things and it totally works.\nWhat can we say; record stores are more pleasant places to visit than the Galleria, Target, and Wal-Mart the day after Thanksgiving.\nHere in Houston you can expect crowds with tryptophan hangovers at Cactus Music, Sig\u2019s Lagoon, Sound Exchange, Heights Vinyl, Vinal Edge, and Black Dog Records on November 28.

{{The company behind the popular card game \u201cCards Against Humanity\u201d has made its stance against Black Friday known for years, but they took things to a whole new level this year.\nThe company, who in past years has given away boxes of feces and dug a hole in a random Illinois town as part of their promotional blitz around the holiday, is selling a breathtaking variety of items in what they\u2019re calling a \u201c99 percent off sale.\u201d\nThe website, which is ringed by phrases like \u201cDeath is the Ultimate Savings\u201d and rude comments about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is putting new items on sale every 10 minutes, including a Presidential Mahogany Casket, a Poncho Toilet, and even cash, all of which are being sold at drastically reduced prices.\nThe items, even the obscure ones like the life-sized cut out of Orlando Bloom and an original Picasso Lithograph, have all sold out within seconds, and all have required customers to answer a type of trivia question before they can be purchased.\nIn past years, the company has used Black Friday to deride consumerism. In one instance, the company told patrons to send in $5 in exchange for nothing, and hundreds of people did, with employees of the company pocketing the money or donating their share to charity.\nThe company also raised money to dig a hole in Oregon, IL, and sold boxes of literal bull feces for $6.\nFor your chance at a Nursing Skills Geriatric Medical Doll, or money, or whatever else the company is selling, you can visit their website before the end of the day.\n}}
{{(CNNMoney) \u2014 A group of Wal-Mart workers are planning to stage a walkout next week on Black Friday, arguably the biggest holiday shopping day for the world\u2019s largest retail store.\nThe walkout builds on an October strike that started at a Wal-Mart in Los Angeles and spread to stores in 12 other cities. More than 100 workers joined in the October actions.\nOne of the workers who plans to join next week\u2019s walkout is William Fletcher, who works at a Wal-Mart in Duarte, Calif.\nFletcher, who also participated in the October strikes, claims Wal-Mart cut his hours after he asked to move from the receiving department to another division because of a knee injury. He has since switched departments.\n\u201cI kept asking myself, \u2018when is the retaliation for speaking our mind and acting on our rights going to stop?\u2019 \u201d he said. Wal-Mart did not have an immediate comment in response to Fletcher\u2019s claim.\nThe union-backed groups OUR Walmart and Making Change at Wal-Mart, and a watchdog group Corporate Action Network, are calling on the nation\u2019s largest employer to end what they call retaliation against employees who speak out for better pay, fair schedules and affordable health care.\nOn Black Friday, the organizations expect 1,000 protests, both at stores and online.\nA Wal-Mart spokeswoman said the number of workers who are raising concerns is very small and don\u2019t represent the views of the vast majority of its workforce of 1.3 million.\nBut labor experts say that even a small number of workers could make an impact.\n\u201cEven if there aren\u2019t that many people, it could have an effect, because their campaign in front of stores could discourage shoppers,\u201d said Ken Margolies, senior associate at the Worker Institute a Cornell University.\nThe strike could have an even greater impact if workers from its supply centers participate, according to Margolies. He said it could impede distribution of merchandise on what is usually the busiest day of the year.\nOrganizers have planned a social medial blitz, mobilizing workers through Facebook pages, a YouTube video, Twitter and Tumblr. They\u2019re also using online platforms to collect donations to sponsor striking workers. So far, the campaign has raised more than $22,200.\nWal-Mart workers have been battling with management over pay, benefits and their ability to speak up for years, experts say.\nAccording to Anthony Bianco, author of Wal-Mart: The Bully of Bentonville, butchers at a Wal-Mart supercenter in Jacksonville, Texas, voted to form a union in 2000 \u2014 the first time employees had done so. But soon after that, Wal-Mart eliminated butcher departments in its stores across the country, he said. It has been reported that Wal-Mart said it got rid of its meat department as a cost cutting measure.\nA similar thing happened when workers at a Quebec store attempted to unionize in 2005, Bianco said. Wal-Mart closed that store a few months after that. The company said at the time that its decision was prompted by the union wanting to change how the store operated.\nAlso On The Chicago Defender:\n}}
{{November, as any self-respecting online bargain hunter would know, is an exciting month of online sales - on Saturday, the Singles' Day or 11.11 sale takes place, followed by Black Friday on Nov 24 and Cyber Monday on Nov 27.\nThese events have been growing in popularity year on year, so much so even brick-and-mortar retailers have rolled out their own editions.\nFor the first time this year, department store Metro is holding a Singles' Day sale on Saturday, offering buy-one-get-one-free deals as well as 20 per cent discounts for card members. And for the second year in a row, it is holding a Black Friday sale from Nov 24 to 26, offering up to 75 per cent in discounts.\nDuring Black Friday, it will open its Paragon and Centrepoint stores at 7.30am and provide breakfast - including coffee and chocolate muffins - until 10am for its early-bird shoppers.\n\"The retail landscape is changing and we are constantly evolving to keep up with the trends and to stay relevant,\" says Ms Peggy Tan, Metro's marketing manager.\nDepartment store Robinsons is also organising 11.11 and Black Friday sales across its three stores as well as online. Since these sales coincide with the year-end festive season, they are appropriate for those looking to do their Christmas shopping, says a Robinsons spokesman.\nDrugstore chain Watsons is holding its 11.11 sales from now until Wednesday on its website and app. And this year, MAC Cosmetics and The Body Shop have joined Lazada's platform in time for its Online Revolution sale, in hopes of increasing their online reach.\nTips to ace the November online sale season\n1 Prep the app Download your favourite websites' apps and browse the products to see what deals you want to snag. Pre-load your shopping cart so you need only click \"checkout\" on the sale day. Remember to enable your app notifications so that alerts on good deals pop up. 2 Mark your targets Many sites let you label products that have caught your eye as favourites or starred items. For example, Lazada has a wishlist function on its app where shoppers can keep track of what they want. \"By doing so, you get up-to-the-minute alerts on the best deals for the products you've picked,\" says Lazada's group chief commercial officer Robin Mah. 3 Shop smarter with cashback Consider using cashback sites such as Shopback, which allow you to get cash back if you buy items through them, says avid online shopper Tan Yien. Cashback amounts can range from 5 per cent to 20 per cent of an item's price. 4 Pay with the best card You can save even more by using selected credit cards, depending on the deals each site offers. 5 Keep an eye on shipping and delivery options Remember that time saved may be worth just as much as money saved. Some sites offer custom delivery systems such as Qoo10's popular QX Quick Delivery, a three-hour express service that lets customers pick their preferred delivery times. 6 Do your homework Compare sale products and prices across various sites, says Ms Tan. \"Let's say I'm buying a fan - it may be offered in different colours at different prices on different sites,\" she says. 7 Strength in numbers Gather your friends to make bulk purchases. This way, you can take advantage of group-buying discounts, Mr Mah recommends. SOURCES: QOO10, LAZADA, TAN YIEN\nEven heartland family businesses and smaller mom-and-pop shops are looking to cash in on the action. These include shoe stores Mimosa and Dr Kong, industrial power tools store Teck Cheong Hardware, camping equipment store Winning International and baby and nursing products store Mums & Babes.\nE-commerce platforms such as Qoo10, Lazada, Shopee, Taobao, ezbuy and Zalora are bracing themselves for when the online sale season flags off with 11.11.\n\"As consumers' needs continue to evolve rapidly, more retailers are beginning to understand the value of adopting an omnichannel retail strategy,\" says Mr Zhou Junjie, Shopee's Singapore country head.\nConsumers are shopping more online and since \"it is difficult to develop a high-performing Web infrastructure from the ground up, many retailers turn to platforms like Shopee\", he adds.\nThe platform saw a 35 per cent increase in the number of seller sign-ups in the month leading up to its 11.11 Shopee Super Sale, 40 per cent of which have a physical retail presence, says Mr Zhou. He adds that the number of sellers with brick-and-mortar stores on the platform has increased by 60 per cent this year, compared with last year.\nTo prep for this month's sales period, Qoo10 is extending its retail space into the physical world, with a fair at Suntec City's atrium and 20 merchants setting up booths selling beauty, food and lifestyle products until Sunday.\nMr Hyun Wook Cho, Qoo10 Singapore's country manager, says that about 80 per cent of its sellers operate physical stores and that more merchants now let customers pick up purchases at their stores.\nThe November period means bumper sales for Lazada, whose Online Revolution sale offers discounts of up to 90 per cent. During this period, says Mr Alexis Lanternier, chief executive of Lazada Singapore, the orders placed on key sale dates can go up to 10 times of a regular day's.\nThis year, the site has more than 5,000 participating local sellers for the sale, twice the number compared with last year.\nPiano teacher Tan Yien, 28, says she gladly welcomes the arrival of more traditional brick-and-mortar stores to the online sale period as this means more options for shoppers.\nThe mother-of-two regularly buys household products and groceries such as diapers and milk powder online and shops at sales looking for discounts, promotions and freebies.\nShe particularly enjoyed a 11.11 sale last year that featured \"surprise boxes\" - in which shoppers could get a hundred dollars' worth of mystery brand-name products in a box for $29.\n\"That was quite fun because of the surprise element.\"\nThe only thing to be wary of, she says, is that during such sales, there may be delays in shipping due to the volume of orders being dealt with.\nOnline sales a shoo-in for shoe store\nMimosa\u2019s director Ong Soon Keat and his wife Choa Shi Ling are participating in the 11.11, Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales for the first time. ST PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID\nTo try to revive a declining business, women's shoe store Mimosa is hedging its bets on this month's online sale season as well as its venture into e-commerce.\nFor the first time, the shoe store, with six outlets here, is participating in 11.11 (Nov 11), Black Friday and Cyber Monday - through e-commerce platforms Lazada and Qoo10.\nThe brand's director, Mr Ong Soon Keat, 41, says he decided to jump into the fray this year to see how effective online sales events are.\n\"Sales at our retail stores have been slow for the past few years. This is a good opportunity to boost our sales. Customers are drawn to online platforms on these particular days,\" he says.\nRelated Story Celebrating being single with good buys\nRelated Story South Korean firms woo China's Singles Day shoppers as detente boosts hopes\nThe brand started selling its wares on Lazada and Qoo10 this year.\n\"We used to serve younger customers, but now, we see fewer young people in our stores. We realised they are now shopping online and that we had to go online and reconnect with them or we would lose them forever,\" says Mr Ong.\nBut although online sales have been encouraging, he says the brick-and-mortar stores still make up about 97 per cent of business.\nMr Ong, who left a career in teaching, opened the first Mimosa outlet with his wife and her parents at Far East Plaza in 2007.\n\"At the time, that was where all the young people hung out. Business was good then,\" he says.\nAt their peak in 2012, they had 11 stores, six of them in Far East Plaza alone, under the names Mimosa and Covet. But shortly after, trade started to decline and the stores shuttered one by one.\nDetermined to turn things around, Mr Ong took a series of e-commerce courses in June and even made a trip to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou in August to learn about its operations.\nThat was when he realised just how big the online market is.\n\"The potential is there,\" he says. \"You really have to differentiate your products from the rest. Once you do that, pricing is not an issue.\"\nOnline sales such as 11.11, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, he says, help to increase brand visibility, especially among younger shoppers. Mimosa will be offering $11 deals on its shoes, usually priced at $12.90.\nThis means not turning a profit on the items, says Mr Ong, but he hopes the exposure will be worth it. After all, the father of two expects average daily sales to triple this month.\nDespite his enthusiasm about e-commerce, however, Mr Ong plans to keep his six brick-andmortar outlets to provide an \"omni-channel approach to sales\".\n\"I think online customers feel more assured because they have seen our brand around. It gives them more confidence to make the purchase online,\" he says, adding that online shoppers are given a $3 voucher to shop at Mimosa's physical outlets.\nYoung successors of brick-and-mortar stores make online push\nTeck Cheong Hardware owner Oh Lee Tong and his son Jayden decided to take the business online together. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\nWhen it participated in Lazada's Online Revolution sale on 11.11, or Nov 11, for the first time last year, Teck Cheong Hardware, which sells power tools from its warehouse in Ang Mo Kio, saw a threefold increase in orders placed.\nThe company had heard about the 11.11 sales frenzy in China, \"but we didn't expect that it would have such a huge impact in Singapore as well. We were caught by surprise\", says its business development manager Jayden Oh.\nThis year, it will not be caught out - the company is doubling its stocks and making space in its warehouse for them.\nAnd to attract more sales, it will be offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on the site, up from last year's 30 per cent.\nThe online push is spearheaded by the 26-year-old Mr Oh, whose great-grandfather started the business in 1965. But the idea of taking the business online came jointly from himself and his father.\n\"We have to adapt to changes in market trends,\" the younger Mr Oh explains. \"Going online gets us exposure and attention from customers we were unable to reach in the past.\"\nHe wasn't sure how to go about doing it. We had to ask him to try purchasing items online. MR TERENCE TAN on his father, who owns camping equipment seller Winning International\nTheir regular clientele consists of contractors and industrial businesses. But now, they have expanded their product range to meet the demand from new groups of consumers reeled in amid the online shopping wave.\nFor instance, they now offer smaller, portable tools to cater to crafters and DIY practitioners.\nEvolution is not new for Teck Cheong Hardware. The business grew from a pushcart hawking used tools in the Sungei Road area.\nAnother local family-run business, Winning International, which sells camping equipment, is also ramping up for 11.11 - a charge led by its founders' young successors.\nWhen Mr Terence Tan, 24, and his sister Tricia Tan, 25, began to take an active role in helping to run their parents' company, they introduced lifestyle products such as beanbags and travel gear.\nTo prepare for the online sales period across various e-commerce platforms, the brand - with five stores in locations including Lot One and Westgate - is stocking up on its most popular items, such as luggage and sleeping bags, and offering discounts of up to 20 per cent.\nIt was only in April last year that it entered the e-commerce sphere by setting up its website, www. winningmktg.com. It also began selling on platforms such as Qoo10, Lazada, Shopee and ezbuy.\n\"Sales were starting to get a little stagnant. We were looking at platforms and avenues for growth,\" Mr Tan says.\nAlthough his father, who started the business in 1991 in the Beach Road area, was open to the idea of going online, \"he wasn't sure how to go about doing it\". \"We had to ask him to try purchasing items online. He purchased a phone charging cable - a small item,\" Mr Tan recounts.\nNow, his father is a convert. He realised that items move faster online than at physical outlets, says Mr Tan.\n\"We have more exposure as well. We have had people at our stores telling us that they saw our products online and came down to check us out. It's good to hear this kind of feedback.\"\n}}

{{This Friday, when you head down to your favourite mall for the deal of a lifetime on that 52-inch TV, exercise a little caution.\nYou might get hurt \u2014 or worse \u2014 by other shoppers who want that TV much more than you do.\nAt least that\u2019s what a University of B.C. Sauder School of Business professor has concluded in a study looking at shoppers\u2019 habits before and during Black Friday, when holiday sales offer big deals for customers but also send dozens of people to the emergency ward.\nAnd, occasionally, the morgue.\n\u201cFrom the research we\u2019ve done, it seems like it\u2019s a hardwired reaction to when we\u2019re faced with scarce goods that we want that there isn\u2019t a lot of,\u201d said Darren Dahl, who co-authored research that found the seeds of consumer aggression can be planted long before customers enter a store. \u201cWhen you think of it in evolutionary terms, we\u2019d compete and be aggressive to get (food and goods).\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a sad commentary that we\u2019d have this reaction for something like iPhones.\u201d\nDahl said much can be done to avoid the type of aggression increasingly common at Black Friday sales, including developing lineup protocols and managing a product\u2019s scarcity.\n\u201cAs a consumer, you should be aware. Don\u2019t go into a road-rage type moment. As a store or retailer, be very mindful of the impact of these sales events by managing crowds or having enough staff on hand, or (have) a queuing system that works.\u201d\nAmong other things, Dahl found that aggressive behaviour begins the moment customers are first exposed to retail ads.\n\u201cWhen an ad promotes a limited quantity of TVs or iPhones at an amazing sale price, consumers start seeing other consumers as a potential threat to their ability to buy that product,\u201d said Dahl.\n\u201cThis threat then provides a base response that can turn into aggression. One of our experiments even found that exposure to scarcity promotions led to increased levels of testosterone \u2014 a hormone shown to be predictive of aggressive behaviour \u2014 among participants.\u201d\nPeople affected by ads can have the same aggressive reaction to a limited quantity of TVs as they do to a shortage of food or water, Dahl said.\nSuch reaction taps into something primal, in that \u201cparticipants in our study literally experienced a physiological change that prepared the body to aggress when they were exposed to these types of ads. So, in order to eliminate the perceived threat they felt from other consumers, participants responded with aggression.\u201d\nbmorton@postmedia.com\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

{{The Walmart Black Friday 2015 brings the return of the 1 Hour Guaranteed in stock deals to Walmart Stores on Thanksgiving. One of the biggest questions is, \u201cAre the Walmart Black Friday 2015 1 Hour Guarantee deals worth buying?\u201d\nWe hope to answer that question for each of the five deals and let you know if you should stand in line for deals. That\u2019s right, the special 1 Hour Guarantee is only available on a small number of items, and it\u2019s not available online so you will need to pay attention if you want to save.\nCraig Robinson, aka Darryl from The Office is serenading shoppers with details about the Walmart Black Friday 2015 1 Hour Guarantee deals in new ads on TV that the retailer hopes will lure shoppers in on Thanksgiving Day.\nIf you want to get the Walmart guaranteed deals you will likely need to skip Thanksgiving since they start at 6PM on Thursday November 26th. You will likely need to get there before 6PM, but even if the store runs out you will have the opportunity to buy the item and get it delivered by Christmas eve to your local Walmart.\n[contextly_sidebar id=\u201dZzK5RmElaFR4qTSygPqifPbcX9bRXH1j\u201d]\nThe Walmart Black Friday 2015 ad includes a smaller number of 1 Hour Guarantee deals than earlier years \u2014 but the quality is ramped way up.\nWalmart stopped calling these a 1 Hour in stock Guarantee last year, since the item may not be in stock in that store, but if you are in line at the right time you can make sure you get one in time for Christmas.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycBfiG-N8so\nYou\u2019ll need to be in line on Thanksgiving before 7 PM local time to get in on these deals. If the items are in stock you can buy it immediately. If it is out of stock you can pay for a ticket, register that online and it will ship to your local store. You need to register by November 30th.\nShoppers can buy more than one of the 1 Hour Guarantee Walmart Black Friday 2015 items if they can make it to another line before 7 PM, but there is a limit of 1 individual item per line. So you could in theory get the iPad Air 2 deal and the Xbox One deal, but not two iPad Air 2 devices.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at if the Walmart Black Friday 2015 1 Hour Guarantee Items are worth buying.\n}}
{{It is normal for Destiny\u2019s Xur to go missing from his known location each Sunday, which is thanks to the Agent of the Nine disappearing the same time of arrival after just two days each week. You can next look for the new Xur location in Destiny from November 28, although this is the same date as Black Friday 2014.\nThis fact will mean very little to some of Product Reviews readers, although others won\u2019t wonder where is Xur in Destiny on Black Friday, but rather where are the best video game deals for PS4, Xbox One, and previous generation systems.\nDestiny\u2019s Xur appears in a new location at 9AM UK time, or around 1/2am in the US at Pacific Time. Late night gamers normally like to play in the early hours and find Xur the moment he arrives in Destiny, and yes that\u2019s even in the early US hours as well. On Black Friday, this could be very different thanks to stores opening for late night shopping on Thanksgiving day.\nIn fact, we\u2019ve heard that many of the bigger game stores will open at 12:01am on Black Friday, so we expect a lot less players to be hunting Xur when he arrives within Destiny on Black Friday. This event only happens once a year, although Xur appears in the game every week.\nWill you be hunting the new Xur location in Destiny on November 28, or would you rather be visiting the Black Friday sales at 1/2AM next week? We also hear that GameStop is opening many of their bigger stores from Midnight as well.\n}}

{{TUCSON (KGUN9-TV) - The turkey won't even be cold before people head out to hunt down those hot Black Friday deals.\nBlack Friday got its name because it's the boost that can put stores in the black for the year and that shopping surge is something stores, large and small take very seriously.\nWalmart's been planning this year's Black Friday ever since the last one. Stores stopped keeping Black Friday deals secret until the last minute. They want you to know the deals in time to plan with military precision.\nWalmart spokesperson Delia Garcia says, \"Then they can find how those departments are gonna be color coded so they can even plan, make their plan now with going on the Walmart app, seeing the store map to see where those items are going to be and they can get their operation together even before Black Friday.\"\nWalmart gets advice from kids on what toys to stock. That led to toys ranging from high tech and interactive to low tech and traditional.\nElectronics are another emphasis, with deals ranging from Smart TVs to gadgets that let you manage your home with your voice.\nThe company says it's keeping prices low and stocks high so you can be confident it will not run out of the items you want.\nBig retailers offer a world of options but some people want to shop for local items.\nFourth Avenue is full of shops like Antigone Books with an emphasis on local goods.\nBookstore co-owner Kate Randall says, \"As you go into local shops you'll find things by for us, local authors, local artists and just basically lots of exciting things that get especially picked out for Tucson and the people of Tucson.\"\nAnd with a mix of people on your list, you might choose a mix of styles from big stores and small.\n}}

They couldn't wait to spring through those doors, make their purchase, and load those $200 50 inch TVs onto their truck.\n\"I mean I got to pay my tuition I got books and things to pay off, I got things to save, I can't be spending all kinds of money,\" said Castaneda, who estimates he and his friend saved a combined $700.\nWith only 20 of the TVs in stock, many customers had to settle for the next best deal.\n\"We came two hours early but it wasn't early enough apparently, they came out with some tickets for the 55 inch so we decided to do that,\" said Robert Clontz.\nIn order to keep the sanity, Best Buy only allows 75 customers inside at a time, and has a staff of 100 employes on duty which is four times more than usual.\n\"You know it's what the customers want, you kind of hear a lot of people say why are you open on Thanksgiving but then you see how many people are in line here,\" said Best Buy Manager Bryan Dee.\nThe sales go beyond electronics, just ask the folks who waited outside Gordmans in Midvale for two hours.\n\"Twenty-five percent off anything you can shove into a bag, I mean come on, clothes for the kids,\" said Kathryn Hargis.\nMany of these bargain hunters said they enjoy the new tradition of bombarding stores on Thanksgiving Day.\n\"I didn't want to watch football,\" said Becky Little.\nClick here for a list of retailers offering Black Friday deals you may have missed.\n}}
{{Black Friday is just two days away (Nov. 27), but it isn't what it used to be when retailers held back on their holiday season pricing deals until the day after Thanksgiving. Once again, \"it's the economy, stupid.\"\nThe strained economic climate now running into its second consecutive holiday season has led most retailers (both on-site and online) to start their sales as early as possible (which is one big reason why you started hearing holiday carols on store sound systems well in advance of Thanksgiving this month).\nStill, even the early deals on HD-centric items are worth noting this time around, and there are some good deals that will have to wait for Black Friday, as usual. Yet, as with most special sales, this week's also comes with its own big caveat: Many of the most enticing deals are extremely short-lived because the HD/Blu-ray products affected are contingent on that infamous \"While Supplies Last\" tag, which, in many cases, could mean less than half a dozen units are available at any one retail outlet.\nBesides noticeable price cuts on both Blu-ray players and Blu-ray disc titles this season, another trend seems to be low prices for 1080p panels\u2014not just the 720p models that were subject to lower price points a year ago.\nIn fact, it's becoming increasingly difficult to even spot any large-screen 720p screens these days in North America, since 1080p has apparently been tapped as the mode-of-choice by consumers. (The fact that nothing is being transmitted in 1080p and you can only take full advantage of the format with 1080p Blu-ray disc content is another matter.)\nIf consumers spend slightly less this year for the holidays, as several surveys have found, it will be interesting to note how both HD set and Blu-ray player sales manage in the weeks ahead, as the percentage of HD household in the United States passes the 50-percent mark.\n}}
{{Oy. Photo by Rob Stothard/Getty Images\nBlack Friday is rapidly approaching \u2026 in Great Britain. And it promises to be as full of crazed bargain-hunting shoppers as the American version. What makes this even more ridiculous? The British don\u2019t celebrate Thanksgiving. (After all, the Pilgrims hosted the first Thanksgiving dinner after their successful exit from England.) And until recently, they didn\u2019t celebrate Black Friday, either. Enter Amazon.\nThe e-commerce juggernaut first introduced Black Friday to Britain in 2010. The concept proved popular. As a result, other U.K. retailers began to offer Black Friday discounts, both online and in stores.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the day achieved something near the legendary status in Britain that it enjoys in the States. That\u2019s when Asda, a U.K.-based superstore owned by, yes, Walmart, began to run Black Friday promotions in its physical stores promising \u201cearth-shattering deals\u201d with \u201cunbeatable\u201d prices. The chain\u2019s chief merchandising officer specifically cited Walmart\u2019s Black Friday sales as an inspiration. Guess what happened next?\nBritish consumers, who for years had thrill-watched American Black Friday shoppers on YouTube, knew exactly what to do. They mobbed the front doors of Asdas across the British isles hours before the 2013 Black Friday sales began, and then, as if on cue, began to fight over the goods when allowed inside. There were reports of a \u201cstampede over cut-price televisions\u201d at a Belfast, Northern Ireland, Asda, and a \u201cscuffle\u201d over the same product at one located near Bristol, England.\nThe Mirror launched a blog to report on retail mayhem, from the Leeds neighborhood of Pudsey to New York City. In a marvelous bit of British understatement, an Asda representative told the media, \u201cOur customers were eager to take advantage of the great offers available to them. \u201d But from a bottom-line perspective, the day was a resounding success for Asda. The chain subsequently reported, according the Telegraph, that it sold 16,000 tablet devices in the space of 60 minutes.\nNot surprisingly, even more U.K. retailers decided to join in 2014\u2019s Black Friday sales bacchanalia. The result was predictable. What the police described as \u201cdisturbances\u201d occurred at retailers holding sales across the country. In one store, customers were almost trampled in the rush to get deals:\nAt a number of Tescos, the staff called the police on their own shoppers. Reports from customers caught offguard\u2014British Black Friday is only a few years old, after all\u2014abounded. One Jamie Hook, who made the mistake of going supermarket shopping at a Tesco that Thursday night, told the BBC he saw \u201cpeople climbing over shelves and displays, staff running for cover, fights breaking out, stock flying through air, people breaking through carrying televisions\u2014and this was before the sale had even started.\u201d Police futilely begged both stores and people to keep better control:\nEven on #BlackFriday shoving people to the floor so you can get \u00a320 off a Coffee Maker is still an assault. pic.twitter.com/azOSD1HmCp \u2014 Surbiton Hill Police (@MPSSurbitonHill) November 28, 2014\n\u201cThey were scenes that shamed Britain,\u201d the Independent recently opined.\nNow, it seems, the British are stuck with Black Friday much as American retailers are\u2014their shoppers now expect it. Some retail analysts predict customers will spend more than 1 billion pounds on combined online and in-store shopping this Friday.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s not even clear Black Friday is a win for British or American retailers, never mind shoppers. LCP Consulting reported only a third of retail executives they surveyed in the United States and Britain claimed the shopping holiday was profitable, with another 28 percent saying it was not only a money loser, but \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\nAs for those looking for discounts, they\u2019re likely not doing much better. The experts say more than a few items can be gotten on sale again in the days closer to Christmas. As for the too-good-to-be-true sale items? Quantity is limited and few customers actually get them. My advice, no matter what country you live in? Stay home and fire up the computer or mobile. The YouTube viewing is bound to be entertaining.\nOne last thing: There won\u2019t be any Asda videos this year. The chain decided to sit this Black Friday out. It turned out all the marauding bargain hunters were scaring off the regular shoppers. \u201cThis year customers have told us loud and clear that they don\u2019t want to be held hostage to a day or two of sales,\u201d Asda\u2019s CEO Andy Clarke explained.\nSee more of Slate\u2019s Thanksgiving reads.\n}}
{{Share\nCovered by an ABC News affiliate in San Diego this week, two women attempted to start the official Black Friday line in front of a Best Buy store in El Cajon, California. Rhiannon Buckingham and Alicia Gomez were filmed by an ABC News crew after they set up a couple outdoor folding chairs in front of the Best Buy location on Wednesday. Buckingham told the news team that she purposely wanted to get in line approximately eight days before Black Friday in order to secure the best doorbuster items for themselves.\nWhen asked about her previous experience with sitting in line in front of Best Buy on Black Friday, Buckingham said \u201cLast year, I came on Tuesday and I was 17th in line. They only had 15 TVs.\u201d\nSitting in line for a good deal on a television once again, Buckingham had planned to sleep in the folding chair outside of the El Cajon Best Buy and trade shifts with a friend to hold her spot in line over the next week. Unfortunately for Buckingham, management at the El Cajon Best Buy called security to escort both women off the property. Security told both women to return on Thanksgiving to stand in line.\nGetting displaced by security hasn\u2019t stopped Buckingham from waiting in line though. Buckingham relocated to a Best Buy location in La Mesa, California with her folding chair as well as a small tent. Management of the La Mesa Best Buy had a different attitude about early campers and even started taking pictures of the early shoppers for the corporate newsletter.\nAccording to Buckingham, she plans to purchase four televisions, a Blu-ray player, headphones and other electronics when the doors of the Best Buy open at midnight on Black Friday. She believes that she will save approximately $2,000 on purchases due to her position at the front of the line. As of today, she has been joined by a La Mesa resident that was quoted as saying \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing else better to do,\u201d when asked about his reason for waiting in line.\nAccording to Best Buy\u2019s Black Friday sales flyer, the company plans to give out tickets for doorbuster electronics approximately two hours before the doors open on Black Friday. Some of the doorbusters include a 40-inch Toshiba television for $179.99, a $39.99 Toshiba Blu-ray player, a Sony PlayStation 3 bundle for $199.99 and a 15-inch Lenovo laptop for $187.99.\nWhile Best Buy is sticking to the same opening time as last year for Black Friday shoppers, other retailers are starting to open during Thanksgiving to get a jump on the competition. For instance, Walmart will be opening the doors at 8 p.m. and plan to stagger the release of doorbusters at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving as well as 5 a.m. on Black Friday. Sears also plans to open up the doors at 8 p.m. and will be open through Black Friday. In addition, Target plans to open up one hour later on Thanksgiving at 9 p.m.\nThere has been an online backlash in response to stores attempting to open early on Thanksgiving. A Target employee in Corona, California started a Change.org petition, directed at Target CEO Gregg W. Steinhafel, which requested a shift away from opening early on Thanksgiving. To date, that petition has received over 230,000 signatures. However, Target employees that do work the late night Thanksgiving shift will be paid time-and-a-half rather than their normal rate.\n}}
{{Share\nWith the BlackBerry Priv, the Canadian company gave us a glimpse of what could be the company\u2019s Android-filled future. Those who are not ready to give up on BlackBerry OS 10, however, might want to take a peek at BlackBerry\u2019s Black Friday deals.\nStarting with the Passport, BlackBerry will give customers a $100 discount on the boxy smartphone, effectively lowering the price tag from $500 to $400. The Passport Silver Edition, a refreshed version of the Passport that swaps out the original\u2019s plastic-laden DNA for stainless steel, is now $500, a $100 discount from the original $600 price tag.\nElsewhere, the nostalgic BlackBerry Classic, which comes in black and blue, currently goes for $300 \u2014 a fair amount lower from its original $380 price tag. Finally, the smallest discount goes to the all-touch Leap, which now sells for $180, only a step down from the original $200 price point.\nUnfortunately, BlackBerry did not issue any discounts for the recently-released Priv, nor for the Q5 and the Porsche Design P\u20199983. In addition, unlike HTC and Samsung, BlackBerry did not issue discounts for any of its accessories, making Black Friday a smartphone-laden affair for the company.\nOf course, we wouldn\u2019t blame you if any of these deals made you stop and think. For one, the app situation for BlackBerry OS 10 is relatively paltry, even when you consider the Amazon Appstore, which we consider more of a stopgap than an actual solution.\nIn addition, with the Priv\u2019s release, many have wondered whether BlackBerry will slowly kill support for its in-house operating system. Even though the company has come out and refuted the claim, it\u2019s not hard to see BlackBerry inevitably make a complete switch to Android just to remain afloat.\nIf any of that hasn\u2019t pushed you away, however, know that all of these discounts are only in effect until December 1 or while stocks last.\n}}

{{\u00d7 Almost three background checks per second as gun sales boom on Black Friday\nBy Kristina Sgueglia\n(CNN) \u2014 The busiest shopping day of the year also saw a major boom for gun sales, with the federal background check system expected to set a record of more than 144,000 background checks Friday, according to the FBI.\nThe staggering number of checks \u2014 an average of almost three per second, nearly three times the daily average \u2014 falls on the shoulders of 600 FBI and contract call center employees who will endure 17-hour workdays in an attempt to complete the background reviews in three business days, as required by law, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer said.\n\u201cTraditionally, Black Friday is one of our busiest days for transaction volume,\u201d Fischer said.\nOn average, more than 500 gun background checks a day fail because of incomplete information required for a decision, according to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is responsible for checks on firearm purchases from federally licensed shops.\nOfficials estimate that about 3,000, or 2%, of the more than 144,000 Black Friday background checks will not be completed because of insufficient information from records such as court documents.\nEmployees of the background check agency, who work every day but Christmas, will work through the weekend to vet Friday\u2019s purchases.\nAs of 2 p.m. Friday, the agency had processed more than 94,000 transactions, on pace to surpass last year\u2019s 144,758, Fischer said\n\u201cWe are averaging three checks per second,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge is to have staff keep up with this volume. We do that by limiting personal leave, asking employees to work extra shifts and reutilizing former \u2026 employees to serve in NICS during this busy period.\u201d\nThe agency brings in 100 extra employees to deal with the increase.\n\u201cThis means saving lives and protecting people from harm \u2014 by not letting guns fall into the wrong hands,\u201d FBI Manager Kimberly Del Greco said in a statement. \u201cIt also ensures the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers.\u201d\nOverall, about 186,000 background checks a year cannot be completed, according to the FBI. It\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many gun sales are authorized from that number because whether to make the sale is ultimately in the hands of the shop owner.\nLast year, the agency completed 21 million background checks, and about 1.1% of those purchases were denied, the agency said.\nFirearm background checks have doubled from the more than 9 million conducted when the system was implemented in 1999.\nTen factors can disqualify a purchase: felony conviction, arrest warrant, documented drug problem, mental illness, undocumented immigration status, dishonorable military discharge, renunciation of U.S. citizenship, restraining order, history of domestic violence or indictment for any crime punishable by longer than one year of prison.\nGun purchasers are required to fill out a form from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with basic identification information and questions about the 10 disqualifying factors.\nThe gun shop can read the information to the background check agency over the phone or run the information through a secure Internet connection.

{{INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Nov. 29, 2013)\u2013 With so many big screen TV deals this holiday shopping season (more than 20 TVs 40\u201d screens or larger for under $300), it can be overwhelming to know whether you\u2019re getting a deal, or falling in to the marketing hype.\nThe online shopping experts at FatWallet.com suggest applying these simple steps should guide you to a smarter purchase. For example, their Black Friday Deal Finder features a 32\u201d Seiki TV which normally sells for $224. It is marked to be on sale on Black Friday for $98. First, checking the TV model cost with an online price tracker like camelcamelcamel.com revealed it\u2019s lowest price ever was $199 in October. So far, so good. Then a quick Google search to compare prices of similar size and quality TVs shows the current low price at $179. So purchasing this Black Friday TV at $98 would save you at least $81 on Black Friday and you can rest assured you\u2019ve scored a good deal.\nFatWallet\u2019s Top 10 TV deals on Black Friday weekend, and why these are good buys:\n1) Target: Element 50\u201d 1080p LED HDTV $229 (was $599.99) This doorThe best priced TV in this size range during Black Friday 2012 was from Sears for $299. It\u2019s not a top name brand or the highest quality out there, but it\u2019s a bargain for a second TV.\n2) Amazon: Seiki 50\u201d 1080p LED HDTV $229 (was $599) This is matches the target 50\u2033 TV, except you can stay home, and order from the comfort of your couch.\n3.) Sam\u2019s Club: Vizio LED Razor 70\u201d 1080p 120 Hz HDTV $998 (was $1,699.99) The only 70\u201d LED HDTV we\u2019ve ever seen under $1,000, and it\u2019s a smart TV, too. NOTE: Same deal available at Walmart.\n4.) Best Buy: LG 55\u2033 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV $499.99 (was $999.99) This is a budget model but specs show it\u2019s a solid TV. If you check 55\u201d TVs at Best Buy, this one comes in $50 cheaper than their lowest end RCA model, which is $549.\n5.) BJ\u2019s Wholehouse: Samsung 46\u2033 1080p 120Hz LED 3D HDTV +3D Blu-ray Player w/WiFi $579.99 (was $849.99) TV itself is the same price as on Amazon, but what makes this deal sweet is the included blu-ray player that will play 3D movies added in for basically free ($70 value).\n6.) Best Buy: Insignia 39\u201d 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $169 (was $249) If you look at what Amazon has for TVs in this size range, they cost around $299, so at $169 this is a good buy. NOTE: Insignia 24\u2033 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV &79.99 (was $169.99)\n7.) Walmart: Vizio 60\u2033 1080p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV $688.00 (was $998.00) LINK This was a better buy at this price last year (it retailed for over over $200 more) It\u2019s still a solid buy this year.

Kohl\u2019s: LG 42\u2033 1080p LED HDTV $379.99 (was $499.99) The price of this one is average at sale price value, but what makes it a deal is taking an extra 15% off using any credit card.

And with Kohl\u2019s Black Friday special of 15% off (w/coupon) and $15 Kohl\u2019s cash with every $50 spent, it\u2019s a huge bargain.\n9.) Walmart: Funai 32\u2033 720p 60Hz LED HDTV $98 A 32\u201d TV for under $100 is a good deal, if you read the example above. Not much else to day about that. Don\u2019t let the 720p deter you as we explain in FatWallet\u2019s TV buying guide with a screen this size you have to be under 4\u2019 away to notice the difference between a 720p and 1080p TV.\n10) Kmart: RCA 42\u2033 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $299.00 (was $449.99) Almost half price for a TV that got 4 out of 5 stars from PC Mag. It\u2019s a solid TV for the money. There are other models that will be available for the same price, but none that rate as well.\nSOURCE: FatWallet.com\n}}
{{Share\nIf you need something a bit more premium than some of the cheaper, entry-level Chromebooks on the market, then you may want to take a look at Best Buy come this Black Friday. As part of the retailer\u2019s holiday sale, Google\u2019s Pixelbook will be $300 off, taking its price from $999 to just $699.\nThe savings is only valid on Google\u2019s base Pixelbook configuration and doesn\u2019t apply to models with upgraded specifications. This means that the model that will be on sale will come with a 7th-Generation Intel Core i5 processor, along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage. At $699, this is one of the lowest prices we\u2019ve seen for the Pixelbook, and according to Chrome Unboxed, the deal comes with three months of free YouTube TV for new subscribers. Best Buy\u2019s pricing is valid between November 22 and 24.\nIf you need more storage, Best Buy does offer the 256GB Pixelbook model for $1,199 and a high-end model with 512GB of storage, 16GB RAM, and an Intel Core i7 processor for $1,649, though neither of these models were discounted on Best Buy\u2019s published Black Friday advertisement. None of the Pixelbook models ship with the pen, so digital artists and note-takers who want to ink should budget an extra $99 for the Pixel Pen accessory.\nShoppers looking for #MadebyGoogle hardware will also have another option come this holiday season when it comes to Chrome OS. This year, Google also announced a new Chrome OS tablet in the form of the Google Pixel Slate. The tablet, which is designed to compete against Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 6, and other detachables on the market, can be used with an optional folio keyboard cover that essentially converts the tablet into a laptop form factor.\nLike the Pixelbook, Google\u2019s Pixel Slate also doesn\u2019t ship with the Pixel Pen, and the optional keyboard cover adds another $199 to the overall cost. The Pixel Slate starts at $799; given that the tablet will only begin to ship in time for the holidays, we don\u2019t expect the Pixel Slate to see any discounts this holiday shopping season. At $799, you\u2019re getting 64GB of storage, 8GB RAM, and a newer but weaker 8th-Generation Intel Core m3 processor alongside a 12.3-inch display. The Pixelbook likely represents a better value with most shoppers, given that it comes with a more powerful processor, more storage, and the keyboard is built-in. If you need help deciding between the Pixelbook and the Pixel Slate, be sure to check out our comparison guide and our review.\n}}
{{BLACK Friday 2018 sales will begin on November 23. Here\u2019s how to get the best deals, discounts and bargains at the annual event.\nBlack Friday promises a plethora of amazing discounts and bargains. Every year, shoppers are sent into a frenzy as they snap up affordable products in time for Christmas. But how can you tell if you are actually getting a good deal? Daily Star Online spoke to Julian House, founder of My Favourite Voucher Codes, to find out more.\nBARGAIN HUNT: Here's how to hone in on the best offers this November (Pic: GETTY)\nFour ways to bag the best bargains in the Black Friday sales 1. Do some research It\u2019s all too easy to throw items into your trolley without considering if they\u2019re at a reasonable price point. Instead of grabbing everything that\u2019s been discounted, it\u2019s advisable to do your research first. Money expert Julian said: \u201cDon\u2019t assume someone selling an item at \u201c30% off\u201d makes it the cheapest you\u2019ll get it. \u201cThat\u2019s typically just 30% off the price that retailer has been selling it for a certain amount of time. Still do your homework. \u201cA quick Google search for the exact name of the product will typically return ads with prices, so you can do a quick scan of prices elsewhere today. \u201cDon\u2019t abandon the usual price checks just because of the big discount marketing!\u201d\n5bee9ed6e0fa022aef64d246\n2. Check price history In the past, stores have been accused of hiking up prices before promotions start. When they are then reduced in the sales, they end up looking like better deals than they are. To avoid being hoodwinked by this trick, see how the cost has fluctuated over time. Julian recommends: \u201cYou can use the Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) to check what a previous version of a web page looked like on a given date. \u201cSo if you\u2019re browsing the TVs page on a big retailer\u2019s website, you pop the web address into the Wayback Machine and see what that page looked like on a variety of different dates. \u201cThis will give you a true idea about whether the deal really is as good as it looks or whether there are generally always similar products at a similar price.\u201d\nNO TIME LIKE THE PRESENTS: Many will be snapping up their Christmas gifts early (Pic: GETTY)\n3. Use voucher codes Like with any purchase you make, you can get money off by using vouchers. This can cut down the cost of your bargain shop even further, so don\u2019t forget to apply them at checkout. Julian added: \u201cSome retailers will let you apply discount codes on top of any existing deals (not all). \u201cSo do hunt the voucher codes out and it\u2019s always worth at least trying to apply them to your basket at the end of the shop.\u201d\n}}
{{\"Americans come together to bow before their lord, the Walmart rollback guy. 'Cause Jesus isn't the only one who saves\"\nShoppers stormed the stores today to kick off the holiday shopping season with a day of trampling, violence and other forms of mayhem, all in the name of getting a good deal. The traditional post-Thanksgiving retail bonanza known as Black Friday has long been a favorite of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, which has humorously skewered the day (along with its more recent digital counterpart Cyber Monday).

'Cause Jesus isn't the only one who saves,\" Colbert said, going on to reveal the Biblical roots of the shopping frenzy.

That was also the year that one L.A. shopper was so determined to get a good deal that she pepper-sprayed fellow shoppers to get her hands on an Xbox. \"Good for her,\" Colbert said, suggesting that her behavior be used as the inspiration for a game: Call of Duty: Black Friday Ops.\nSee more Stephen Colbert's Career in Pictures\n\"Black Friday Interpretation\" (Nov. 29, 2010) The year before Colbert revealed he made a terrible mistake in what he believed Black Friday to be about, thinking it was connected to a traditional Christmas story. \"I'd like to extend sincere apologies to everyone at my neighborhood Walmart who may have been offended by my wrongful interpretation of what Black Friday means,\" he said.\nRead more Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell on Running From the KKK and the Value of Being \"Nauseated by Food\"\nThe Daily Show\n\"Turkey Day\" (Nov. 26, 2012) Two years ago, Stewart suggested that the violent behavior exhibited on Black Friday might really just be pent-up hostility from an uncomfortable experience with one's extended family the day before.

{{Share\nApple\u2019s iOS App Store downloads surged in the shopping category on Black Friday, as millions of Americans started hunting for deals from their favorite retailers.\nAccording to information gathered by marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, there has been a 26 percent increase in year-on-year downloads, reaching 1.05 million downloads in a single day. The majority of those downloads were for Amazon, Wish, RetailMeNot, and Walmart, which collectively noted 363,000 downloads on Black Friday \u2014 200,000 from Amazon alone.\nAmazon app downloads were 242 percent higher than last year. Amazon has improved the experience for mobile users over the year \u2014 even though it still doesn\u2019t offer Apple Pay support for purchases \u2014 which has given the app more exposure on iOS.\nSan Francisco based e-tailer Wish also noticed a huge surge in downloads on Black Friday, reaching 61,000 downloads, moving five places higher than its position in 2014. The store allows suppliers to set their own price for goods, and plenty took advantage on Black Friday to increase sales. Similarly, eBay jumped four places over its position in 2014, with 24,000 downloads on Black Friday.\nWe don\u2019t know how much money was made on iOS during Black Friday, as Apple hasn\u2019t released figures and intelligence firms cannot look into in-app revenue.\nThe biggest losers on Black Friday included Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s, and the Black Friday Ads App. All three noticed less downloads than last year, with Macy\u2019s dropping from 39,000 to 20,000 downloads.\nMost shopping apps are seeing a decline in sales in 2015, according to Sensor Tower.

But in terms of a larger trend, growth was slower compared to this time last year when spending was up 5 percent and quantities rose 3.6 percent.

{{It seems Black Friday 2014 is indeed upon us, even if technically Black Friday began yesterday at 6pm as family members hightailed out of their thanksgiving dinner tables and straight to the shopping aisles at such vendors as Walmart, Best Buy and Macy\u2019s here in NYC. Where there is a will there is a way. Where there is a wet dream there is shopper mayhem\u2026\nWith scrums of shoppers rushing to see what they can pick up at suggested steal prices (because who can refuse a new flat screen tv, skimpy lingerie for the new boyfriend and the chance to watch the frantic perspiration dripping off your fellow shopper on the hunt for idyllic discounts) it was simply business as usual. This after all is America, defined by a culture which has made the consumption of goods and services and the suggested status of such consumption as the defacto instant gratification devoid in a realm where one is taught over and over one\u2019s sense of self is conditional on their possessions. Whatever happened to long walks in the park and sitting in the backroom post full thanksgiving belly, watching your nieces finger paint on your new shoes?\nWho am I to judge?\n\u2018Do you mind moving over so I can get my hands on that Argyle cashmere sweater sir?\u2019\nIndeed\u2026\nAs is customary in the stampede for instant gratification and the perceived saving of some extra dollars (how many cashmere sweaters do I really need anyway?) there was the customary flare of run ins. Run ins which normally happen on Black Friday which instead happened on Black Thursday, Thanksgiving day itself. Yes the notion of being thankful for something has truly been ruined with the ever forward notion of getting one\u2019s hands on goods. Really it would have been that much more bearable to have sat through the sing alongs with an extra heaping of pumpkin pie.\nBut rest assured there were punch ups, run ins, cops with tasers and a few extra heated words.\nShall we then?\nVia the blaze: Then there\u2019s another clip captured at a Walmart that shows additional scuffles unfolding over discount tablets (see mayhem directly below)\nVia the UK\u2019s dailymail: In Indianapolis, two people were arrested for punching an off-duty police officer in a mall parking lot around 3am, Fox59 reported, while sheriff\u2019s deputies were also called to a Walmart store in Norwalk, California after two women started fighting over a Barbie doll.\nOh dear poor Barbie doll.

The officers working security detail didn\u2019t see the fight, but they saw the victim\u2019s bloody nose.\nAn off-duty officer told the suspect to leave. The suspect refused to leave and he started punching the off-duty officer in the jaw.\nThis too led to the boyfriend and girlfriend being arrested oh well, never mind, at least they will both have something exhilarating to talk about next thanksgiving right?\nAnyone for an extra slice of pecan pie or two, I got it on sale of course\u2026\n}}

{{Online sales during Cyber Monday are showing signs of being the savior for US retailers licking their wounds from weak-in-the-knees Black Friday.\nStores were expected to ring up digital sales of $3 billion on Monday, or 12 percent more than last year, according to Adobe Index, which tracks spending at the top 100 US retailers.\nRoughly 41 percent of online purchases were made with smartphones, according to Adobe.\nA good chunk of that spending is on \u201cStar Wars\u201d toys and electronics, the two biggest categories.\n\u201cTwo of the top five toys are \u2018Star Wars\u2019-related and there are some of the futuristic sci-fi film\u2019s products like the BB-8 droid that\u2019s out of stock just about everywhere,\u201d said Tyler White, an Adobe analyst.\nThe strong online demand helped ease the worry of some retailers left wanting after business on Thanksgiving and Black Friday failed to meet expectations.\nSales in stores on those two days are expected to total about $12.1 billion, or 11 percent less than last year\u2019s $13.6 billion haul, according to ShopperTrak.\nSome blamed the lackluster two-day results on retailers jump-starting Black Friday sales by as much as a week.\nNot everyone was feeling pain after Black Friday.\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer, Amazon, said it improved on last year\u2019s Black Friday results when it reported sales of 500 items per second.\nOn Monday, Amazon was adding new deals every five minutes to lure customers.\nWhile online revenue is still a fraction of traditional retailers\u2019 overall sales \u2014 between 10 and 15 percent \u2014 it is an increasingly important component, especially as millions of consumers adapt to using their mobile devices as their go-to shopping tool.\nLast year, the iPhone 6 and tablets led the purchase parade, but this year most people who want an iPhone 6 already have it, White said.\nThis year\u2019s Cyber Monday wasn\u2019t without its frustrations, however, as consumers received word that their chosen item for purchase was out of stock up to 13 percent of the time, according to Adobe data.\nThe PlayStation 4 and Xbox One limited-edition \u201cStar Wars\u201d console bundles were among the hardest items to score.\n}}

{{For better or for worse, Black Friday has become an American tradition. Over the past decade, the busiest shopping day of the year has warped holiday shopping habits, modified retail business strategies, and shortened Thanksgiving dinners -- an impressive cultural impact for a \"holiday\" invented by retailers.\nLet's look back at the history, business strategies, and financial impact of Black Friday to understand how this phenomenon started and where it could be headed.\nThe history of Black Friday\nThe term \"Black Friday\" originated in Philadelphia in the 1960s to describe the heavy pedestrian and road traffic that usually occurred on the day after Thanksgiving. Over the following decades, retailers used the term to describe seasonal profitability. Some retailers operated at a loss from January to November, but holiday sales starting on the day after Thanksgiving would bring them back \"into the black\" with profits.\nYet, it wasn't until the late 2000s -- when retailers started opening at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. on the day after Thanksgiving -- that the modern \"Black Friday\" was born. In 2011, several major retailers -- including Target (NYSE:TGT), Macy's (NYSE:M), and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) -- opened at midnight for the first time. The following year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and several other retailers opened their doors at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. By 2014, retailers were opening for business as early as 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, effectively replacing Thanksgiving with a two-day shopping holiday.\nThe business of Black Friday\nHow did a holiday invented by retailers overwrite the oldest American holiday? The answer is simple: by using steep time-limited discounts, known as \"loss leaders,\" to draw hordes of shoppers into their stores. Retailers sell these products at a loss, hoping shoppers will buy other products in the store at less dramatic discounts. Many of those products might seem cheap to consumers (when compared to regular prices), but the retailer is still making a profit.\nMost retailers post Black Friday ads, coupons, and offers online to help customers plan their purchases. Other companies release their promotions at the last moment to ensure shoppers keep checking their websites for an announcement.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, total Black Friday spending in the U.S. surged from $45 billion to $59 billion. In 2013, total spending slipped to $57.4 billion and then dropped to $50.9 billion in 2014, according to the National Retail Federation. That sharp decline hinted that Black Friday's heyday might be passing.\nThe future of Black Friday\nThe decline of annual Black Friday spending coincided with the rise of online shopping, where revenue on Thanksgiving and Black Friday in the U.S. surged from $1.06 billion in 2010 to $2.51 billion in 2014, according to comScore (NASDAQOTH:SCOR).\nGranted, that's a small amount compared to total retail revenue from Black Friday, but it indicates more shoppers are getting fed up with waiting in long lines, battling other shoppers for \"doorbuster deals,\" and missing Thanksgiving dinner with their families. Meanwhile, e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have ramped up their Black Friday efforts to provide similar deals online.\nRising e-commerce sales during that period puts brick-and-mortar retailers in a tough spot. On one front, they must match or beat online prices; on the other, they must race other retailers to the bottom to attract more foot traffic. To remain competitive, retailers started introducing steep discounts earlier, which weakened the overall impact of Black Friday. David Bassuk, managing director at AlixPartners, told Fortune that strategy \"diminished the excitement\" and essentially made Black Friday \"a non-event\" for most shoppers.\nLessons learned\nBlack Friday will likely remain known as a major shopping day for years to come, but the manic mood might fade as more shoppers buy their products online.\nInvestors in brick-and-mortar retail companies should realize that decline could drag down annual revenue quickly, since November and December are traditionally their biggest months of the year. If Black Friday continues growing as an online event, Amazon, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and other leading e-commerce players will likely profit -- continuing their long tradition of stealing business from brick-and-mortar rivals.\n}}
{{It\u2019s 3:45 in the morning. My stomach is upset over the amount of pumpkin pie I gorged myself on the night before. I\u2019m standing in the chilly darkness and I\u2019m surrounded by a crowd of pushy mothers and grandmothers.\nI should be in bed, but instead I\u2019m waiting in an unfathomable line for Target\u2019s Black Friday event to begin. A shiver creeps up my back and I ask myself, \u201cWhy am I doing this to myself again?\u201d\nThe irate mothers are starting to get restless. Did that kid cut in front of me in line? I don\u2019t think I can handle the pressure of waiting with these people any longer, until, like Saint Peter, the store manager opens the doors to retail heaven and starts ushering people in, 20 at a time.\nOnce I\u2019ve finally made my way inside the Target, I fight and claw all the way to the to the electronics section. I take out a granny or two in the process and locate the FlipCam I had my eye on for the last month. Oh no, there\u2019s only one left and it happens to be in the clutch of a little girl! Her weak, little hands can\u2019t hold onto the camera for long, and eventually, I walk out of the store with my prize.\nSo my re-enactment of last year\u2019s Black Friday may be a little over-dramatized, but that\u2019s pretty close to what I experience every year. The hours are unjust, the crowds are ridiculous and the tensions are sky-high. So why do I continue to be drawn annually into the vicious trap of Black Friday sales?\nCase in point\u2014the deals.\nLet\u2019s face it, the only other place I would be able to buy a FlipCam for myself at a 40 percent markdown is a pawn shop, and it would probably have to be a stolen one.\nBlack Friday is where I get most of my holiday shopping done: I shop at Target for my sister and I, Staples for my father and I, Macy\u2019s for my mother and I, and whatever\u2019s left at Best Buy is just for me.\nApparently, a big chunk of America also gets its shopping done the morning after Thanksgiving. According to the National Retail Federation, total spending in 2010 for Black Friday hit $45 billion. The NRF said, \u201c212 million shoppers visited stores and websites over Black Friday weekend, up from 195 million last year.\u201d Clearly Black Friday is worth it for some people.\nI always get asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay home and shop online? The deals are just as great and you can order at your convenience.\u201d\nMy retort always comes, smartly, in the form of another question. What other time of the year do you have a chance to push over mean, old ladies and pry expensive electronics out of a little girl\u2019s hands? Why sit behind a computer screen when you can be part of the action?\nBlack Friday is like a sport\u2014an ugly, terrible competition. It gets your adrenaline pumping and your wallet open. I enjoy the pressure of fighting with everyone for that prized item just as much as I enjoy the thrill of winning it. I like seeing the mothers squabble in line when someone cuts or when Target runs out of their free promotional totes and can\u2019t hand them out anymore.\nMost of all, I love seeing people cry over losing.\nFor me, Black Friday is almost as much of an American tradition as Thanksgiving. It\u2019s a combination of my two favorite things: shopping and squabbling. In my own weird way, Black Friday is like paradise. And hey, it beats cleaning up the Thanksgiving mess from last night.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for our weekly newsletter with our top stories of the week. Email\n}}
{{The post holiday chaos is starting to bare a striking resemblance to the grisly nature of its etymology.\nWhile the day after Thanksgiving is supposed to be for digestion, Black Friday has been erroneously referred to as the momentous beginning of the Christmas shopping season since the 1980s.\nDespite that being an idealistic way to look at the day that\u2019s responsible for nine deaths and 102 injuries thus far, according to the blackfridaydeathcount.com, there is a history that many like to forget when going out to buy those marked down items.\nThis year 59 percent of Americans\u2013an estimated 137.4 million people\u2013who planned to or considered shopping during the day of sales reckoning, according to a 2016 survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics.\nIt\u2019s no wonder a few eggs have unfortunately cracked in the making of this consumer market omelette.\nThis year, Black Friday has been host to two deaths and four injuries, both of which were a result of fighting over parking spaces. The mere idea of someone being shot dead over a spot to park should really put some sort of damper in the mind of Americans, especially when they consider plowing their way through parents and children just so they can buy an outdated television for 15 percent off.\nFor those wondering, the Saturday before Christmas is usually the best time for sales, according to thebalance.com, so the unnecessary crime is founded in no truly profitable basis.\nThe history of Black Friday is always a conversation that finds its way to the dinner table that Thursday evening. The real story of how Black Friday got its name comes from roots similar to the ones we are witnessing today.\nIn the 1950s, Philadelphia was home to an amazing amount of heroin usage and a collapsing economy. The ripples of the Great Depression were significantly apparent and were felt greatest during the holidays. However, the one thing that brought people together in a time of light-heartedness was the annual Army-Navy football game held most frequently in Philadelphia, which is still held today.\nWith the holidays approaching and a football game commencing, police officers of Philly had no choice but to accept longer hours and time off to oversee and control the monumental rise in volume for shoppers and tourists who flooded the city.\nThe subsequent chaos and recklessness of these rabid consumers led the officers to coin the fatefully crime-ridden day as \u201cBlack Friday,\u201d according to History.com.\nThe retailers attempted to rid the day of its negative connotation, but ultimately failed. But luckily, the term subsided with time.\nUntil only recently has the term been uprooted and spun to convey some sort of sales pitch by collective retailers around America. The day is known for some sort of \u201ceverything-goes\u201d sales that ultimately comes to a $20 to $40 discount for a majority of the shoppers, except for those fools camping out at 3 a.m. on Thursday and waiting until the clock strikes midnight.\nIt seems then that the history of Black Friday has repeated itself, where police officers of a 1950s Philadelphia witnessed crime and traffic at a level big enough to bare a title. This year\u2019s Black Friday chaos is a testament to its original name\u2019s intended connotation.\nThe only thing that is left to do is for the media and the public to at least accept that Black Friday and Friday the 13th have more in common than one might think.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for our weekly newsletter with our top stories of the week.

{{* Brent remains below $60 per bbl after almost 8-pct drop on Fri\n* Oil plunge came amid broad market weakness\n* Morgan Stanley expects weakness to last into 2019\nBy Henning Gloystein\nSINGAPORE, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices won back some ground after hefty losses on Friday, but remained under pressure with Brent crude below $60 per barrel amid weak fundamentals and struggling financial markets.\nFront-month Brent crude oil futures were at $59.20 per barrel at 0049 GMT, up 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $50.58 per barrel.\nBut Monday\u2019s gains did little to make up for the almost 8-percent plunge on Friday, which traders have already dubbed \u2018Black Friday\u2019.\nGreg McKenna, an independent financial analyst from Australia said there had been an \u201cutter capitulation in crude oil\u201d markets.\nThe downward pressure comes from surging supply and a slowdown in demand-growth which is expected to result in an oil supply overhang in 2019.\nWIDER DOWNTURN\nBeyond weak fundamentals, oil markets are also being impacted by a downturn in wider financial markets.\n\u201c2018 clearly marked the end of the 10-year Asia credit bull market due to tightening financial conditions in Asia (especially China), and we expect this to remain the case in 2019,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a note released on Sunday.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that we are at the bottom of the cycle yet,\u201d the U.S. bank said.\nOil markets have also been weighed down by the strong U.S.-dollar, which has surged against most other currencies this year, thanks to rising interest rates that have pulled investor money out of other currencies and also assets like oil, which are seen as more risky than the greenback.\n\u201cAnything denominated against the USD is under pressure right now, said McKenna.\nAnother risk to global trade and overall economic growth is the trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, the United States and China.\n\u201cThe U.S.-China trade conflict poses a downside risk as we forecast the U.S. to impose 25 percent tariffs on all China imports by Q1 2019,\u201d U.S. bank J.P.

{{Marijuana shops, Colorado's newest retailers, are embracing to an old-school tradition: Black Friday.\nMany shops in Denver are planning steep discounts on marijuana products for three days starting Friday, Nov. 28 \u2014 the same tactic used by national retailers like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Best Buy to encourage holiday shopping.\nSee also: Dope grandmas smoke weed for the first time\nAt Grass Station in Denver, the shop plans to offer daily specials including 16 one-once bags of marijuana for $50, 60 cone joints for $1 each, eight 1/8th-ounce bags for $10 and 15 150 mg vapor cartridges for $15, according to Connor Morrison, the store's manager.\nAn ounce usually costs $300, a joint runs about $10 each and a vapor cartridge is usually $35, he said.\n\"We would like to double the 350 to 400 customers we usually get a day on Black Friday,\" Morrison said in a phone interview. \"We have the capacity to do so and we\u2019re prepared to do so.\"\nThe Grass Station is using push notifications to promote sales to its customers. Image: Grass Station\nDubbed by some as \"Green Friday,\" the holiday is the first since Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana use two years ago. The state's roughly 300 retailers have brought in $207 million in recreational sales alone this year \u2014 contributing $52.5 million in state taxes, licenses and fees, according to the Colorado Revenue Department.\nMarijuana legalization is spreading. Washington, where voters also legalized marijuana, held its first weed auction on Nov. 16 and raised $600,000. Earlier this month, voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. approved ballot measures making marijuana legal.\nU.S. legal pot sales this year will be worth about $2.3 billion this year, rising to more than $10 billion by 2018, according to ArcView Group, a San Francisco-based firm that invests in the industry, first cited by Bloomberg News.\nOther pot shops in Denver that are planning specials include Ganja Gourmet, Sticky Buds and The Green Depot.\nIt's not just marijuana buds for sale. Most shops are using marijuana, and its active ingredients THC and CBD, in brownies and other baked goods, as well as in candy bars, lollipops, coffees and sodas. Edibles are quickly growing in popularity, and have become the industry's fastest growing segment.\nUnlike other retailers, however, Colorado's pot shops are restricted in how much they can promote their products, and forbidden to advertise in magazines, newspapers, billboards, radio or television.\nTo get around those restrictions, Morrison said the Grass Station has sent an e-mail blast \u2014 titled \"Green is the new Black\" \u2014 to previous customers who provided their contact details. The store also developed an app that customers can download.\n\"We can send push notifications through that app,\" he said.\nBONUS: How Do We Stop Black Friday?\n}}
{{NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping season showed the increasing preference for online purchases, as more Americans opted to stay home and use their smartphones while sales and traffic at brick-and-mortar stores declined.\nThe ongoing shift to online shopping has forced retailers across the country to invest heavily in boosting their e-commerce businesses, and also highlights the impact of early holiday promotions and year-round deals on consumer spending.\nThe weekend also redefined the importance of Black Friday. For the past few years, Black Friday was believed to be waning in importance, but it is now turning into a day when shoppers do not necessarily flock to stores but spend heavily online.\nBill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, said online sales are starting to complement in-store shopping over the weekend, and for shoppers and retailers the two platforms are starting to converge.\nThis is happening more and more as retailers like Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc sell both online and through stores, making winning the transaction more important than where it occurs, retail consultants and analysts said.\nOnline sales rose more than 23 percent, crossing $6 billion on Black Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers. On Thanksgiving, it estimated sales grew 28 percent to $3.7 billion.\nPreliminary data from analytics firm RetailNext showed net sales at brick-and-mortar stores fell 4 to 7 percent over the two days, while traffic fell 5 to 9 percent, continuing the trend of recent years. No data was yet available for actual spending in stores.\nIn 2017, brick-and-mortar sales were down 8.9 percent for the weekend year-over-year, and shopper traffic fell 4.4 percent. In 2016, store sales were down 4.2 percent and traffic was down 4.4 percent, according to RetailNext.\nThe decrease in store foot traffic is a little greater than it has been in years past, though still within expectations, RetailNext spokesperson Ray Hartjen said.\nData from retail research firm ShopperTrak also showed that visits to stores fell a combined 1 percent during Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared with the same days in 2017.\nBrian Field, senior director of advisory services at ShopperTrak, said online sales have eroded traffic from retailers over the years, \u201cbut what we have noticed is that the decline is starting to flatten out ... Overall its been consistent with where it\u2019s been over the last few years.\u201d\nIn 2017, visits to physical stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were down 1.6 percent, according to the firm.\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\u201cThis decline feels pretty good to me. I think retail is in for a good season,\u201d Field said.\nRetail consultants have said spending patterns over the weekend are not as indicative of the entire season as they were a few years ago the tendency now is to spread shopping over November and December.\nThe National Retail Federation forecast U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December will increase between 4.3 and 4.8 percent over 2017, for a total of $717.45 billion to $720.89 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.\n}}
{{Emma Haslett\nBlack Friday may be the shopping equivalent of Marmite - you either love it or you hate it - but it looks like, despite their complaints, British shoppers are seizing the deals bonanza with both hands.\nFigures from PCA Predict suggest the UK has gone bananas for deals, with a 62 per cent increase in the volume of online activity compared with last year in the hours before 7am alone.\nHere's how things have stacked up so far:\n1. People stayed up late last night to take advantage of deals\nThe figures suggest volumes between midnight and 1am were 660 per cent higher than on an average shopping day. That dipped in the wee hours, rising to 330 per cent as people began to wake up just before 7am.\n2. Mobile is king\nThe humble smartphone has been the weapon of choice for the UK's online shoppers, the figures show. Although we can only speculate over whether that's because people were in bed at the time....\n3.

{{Online retailers rely on the holiday season for a high proportion of their revenue, yet a new survey suggests that with Black Friday only two months away, 38 per cent aren't yet prepared for this year's sales.\nThe survey from email marketing company Campaigner shows this lack of preparedness is despite 70 per cent anticipating a rise in mobile sales and nearly 50 per cent planning to prioritise social sharing for marketing success.\nOther findings are that 50 per cent are enhancing their mobile responsive design to prepare for increased mobile sales this year. Social integration is seen as crucial too, with 71 per cent agreeing that the number one add-on for email marketing success is integration with sites like Facebook and Twitter.\nContent strategy is also changing with 69 per cent saying they're approaching their content strategy differently this season compared to last year. There doesn't seem to be much consensus on how to do this, however, with almost 28 per cent saying they're using more informational content over promotional content but just over 26 per cent saying the opposite. Meanwhile 22 per cent say they plan to incorporate more video content in their efforts but over 15 per cent are planning a simpler approach to content.\n\"It's shocking to learn that such a high number of Internet retailers have not yet begun executing holiday strategies for this year,\" says Seamas Egan, manager of revenue operations for Campaigner. \"Black Friday is just a couple of months away, and for most retailers, the holiday season is ripe with revenue if they prepare adequately\".\nYou can see a summary of the survey results in infographic form below.\nPhoto Credit: Robert Kyllo/Shutterstock\n}}

{{Every year ahead of the holiday season, Apple puts together a year-end gift guide, which is usually a roundup of new products it released just a few month earlier. But this year, in addition to the regular gift guide, Apple has also put up a landing page advertising a mysterious four-day sale event starting this Black Friday through Cyber Monday (November 23 to November 26).\nThough Apple hasn\u2019t shared many details. \u201cMark your calendar. Our four-day shopping event will be here before you know it. This Friday, start checking things off your list\u201d is all it says on the event page.\nSubscribe to Observer\u2019s Business Newsletter\nBased on Apple\u2019s past holiday season promotions, consumers are more likely to receive gift cards on the condition of making a minimum purchase than to get straight discounts on flagship products.\nBut it could also be a completely new campaign, as Apple faces mounting pressure from its investors who are increasingly bearish on the outlook for its new iPhone demand.\nEarlier this week, Goldman Sachs cut its target price for Apple stock the second time this month to $182, warning that the company might have miscalculated the pricing for its new \u201cbudget phone,\u201d the $750 iPhone XR, and would, as a result, face slowing demand in key emerging markets.\n\u201cIn addition to weakness in demand for Apple\u2019s products in China and other emerging markets, it also looks like the balance of price and features in the iPhone XR may not have been well-received by users outside of the U.S.,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\nThe analysts also don\u2019t believe Apple can turn around iPhone sales with an anticipated boost in December. \u201cHistorically, a disproportionately large chunk of December quarter demand tends to come in the two-week period beginning a week before Christmas day, so it is possible that things change though we do not believe this is likely,\u201d they wrote.\nIn the past month, Apple shares have dropped more than 20 percent, diminishing the company\u2019s market cap by $220 billion from its $1 trillion peak in October.\nIn any case, if you don\u2019t want to wait until Friday, several e-commerce sites and department stores are already featuring Apple products in their Black Friday deals. For example, eBay is offering a one-day, 15 percent off site-wide sale (ending 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday); Macy\u2019s is offering up to $80 off on Apple Watch Series 3 purchases; and Target is offering gift cards from $150 to $250 with iPhone purchases on Verizon, Sprint or AT&T.\n}}
{{Black Friday is starting to look a bit more like Cyber Monday. According to IBM's study of 500 retailers, online sales on Friday were up 24.3% over last year, suggesting that people stayed home to avoid the crowds and in-store havoc.\nMobile devices accounted for 14.3% of all online Black Friday traffic, up from 5.6% last year, and they were responsible for 9.8% of online sales. The iPad proved to be the king of post-Thanksgiving retail \u2014 its users were more likely to purchase than other mobile users, with conversion rates reaching 4.6%.\nEcommerce sales increased from last year in many retail sectors, from home to apparel to beauty, and web traffic catapulted department store sales to 59% higher than last year's Black Friday.\nBlack Friday was a hot topic on social media channels, too. Visits to Twitter and Facebook were likely to yield chatter about Black Friday sales, out-of-stock items, parking troubles and long lines. The volume of Black Friday dialogue was 110% more than last year, and there was \"a spike in positive sentiment\" around and anticipation for Cyber Monday.\nDid you use your mobile device to shop on Black Friday?

{{Consumers looking to get an early start on their Black Friday shopping will be out of luck at some stores this holiday season.\nA growing number of retailers have announced they will not be open Thanksgiving Day. They include Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Marshalls, IKEA, T.J. Maxx, Staples and Sam\u2019s Club, among others.\nAll told, more than 50 major retail chains will be closed on Thanksgiving.\nThat news is bound to disappoint hard-core shoppers looking to snag the deepest discounts ahead of everyone else. But the move has clearly resonated with lots of consumers, including Melanie Colbrunn, 39, of Pasadena.\n\u201cI refuse to shop on Thanksgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s a holiday and we need to honor the holiday. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate that some employees can\u2019t have Thanksgiving Day off so they can celebrate at home with their families and let Black Friday start on Friday.\u201d\nRamon Avila, a marketing professor at Ball State University, agreed. The idea of stores being open on Thanksgiving, he said, has rubbed many shoppers the wrong way.\n\u201cThey think retailers have crossed the line,\u201d Avila said. \u201cPeople look down on these companies as being mean to their employees. A lot of these retail workers have young children at home and they can\u2019t spend the day with their parents. It\u2019s also bad PR for these stores.\u201d\nBut bad PR aside, a slew of stores including Kmart, Kohl\u2019s, Fry\u2019s Electronics, Bass Pro Shops, Best Buy and J.C. Penney will be open for all or part of Thanksgiving Day.\nA survey from BestBlackFriday.com an online resource for retail information, shows that nearly 55 percent of Americans don\u2019t agree with stores being open on Thanksgiving. Digging deeper, 37.7 percent of that group \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d with the idea. And of those who strongly disagree, more than 80 percent say they will not shop at stores that are open on Thanksgiving.\nSimilar to years past, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores \u2014 which all fall under the ownership of T.J. Maxx \u2014 will be closed on Thanksgiving. They are scheduled to open at 7 a.m. the following day for Black Friday.\n\u201cWe consider ourselves an associate-friendly company and we are pleased to give associates the time to enjoy Thanksgiving with family and friends,\u201d the company said.\nHome Depot didn\u2019t issue a statement as why it won\u2019t be open on Thanksgiving, but company spokeswoman Margaret Smith said that\u2019s nothing new.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been open on Thanksgiving, so this is really no change for us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everyone shops on the Internet now, so if they want to shop they could do it that way, like on HomeDepot.com.\u201d\nA Nordstrom representative said her company has a similar philosophy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been closed on Thanksgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives our employees a chance to celebrate. But we will have a small team of people working at Nordstrom.com for those who are shopping on the holidays, as well as Nordstrom Bank to take care of our cardholders.\u201d\nLots of major retailers will be closed on Thanksgiving \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be angling for consumers\u2019 Black Friday dollars.\nHome Depot has already posted a notice promoting Black Friday discounts of as much as 50 percent. The home improvement chain will be offering a Samsung 29.5 cubic foot, stainless steel refrigerator, for example, for $2,298. That\u2019s 35 percent off the regular price of $3,549.\nA Samsung POWERbot Robotic Vacuum Cleaner will likewise be marked down 30 percent to $698.\nAvila said the holiday season is crucial for retailers and can sometimes account for about half of a company\u2019s annual revenue. In a brick-and-mortar landscape that has been increasingly undercut by online retailers, the revenue they earn during November and December can mean the difference between a business remaining in operation or closing its doors for good.\nThe National Retail Federation expects holiday sales in November and December (excluding auto, gas and restaurant sales) to increase 3.6 percent this year to $655.8 billion. That would be significantly higher than the average yearly increase of 2.5 percent that\u2019s been seen over the past decade.\n\u201cAll of the fundamentals are in a good place, giving strength to consumers and leading us to believe that this will be a very positive holiday season,\u201d NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement. \u201cThis year hasn\u2019t been perfect, starting with a long summer and unseasonably warm fall. But our forecast reflects the very realistic steady momentum of the economy and industry expectations.\u201d\nLars Perner, an assistant professor of clinical marketing at the USC Marshall School of Business, said the economy has improved to the point where retailers aren\u2019t as dependent on being open Thanksgiving Day. But they may find other ways to cash in.\n\u201cOne of the things they might do is front-load their discounts on the weekend before so their employees won\u2019t have to work on Thanksgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to remember that stores have very limited storage space, so doing it that way might work better.\u201d\n}}
{{There's new data revealing that this year's holiday shopping season may be the busiest yet for online retailers.\nNew reports show that the explosive growth of ecommerce is driving more Americans online and away from brick and mortar. Big retailers like Gymboree, Lane Bryant and Michael Kors are closing thousands of stores and 25% of shopping malls are expected to close in the next five years.\nIt\u2019s all part of the biggest disruption in shopping patterns since the mail-order catalog was invented \u2013 making it more important than ever before for online retailers to prepare now for the onslaught of traffic come Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nWhile most consumers are taking their summertime vacations, retail giants are mobilizing to beef up their online infrastructure and stress test their systems to handle the surge of holiday shoppers at the end of the year \u2013 which can generate more than 30% of their yearly sales.\nDespite this preparation, every holiday shopping season spawns a list of notable failures. Even the smallest misstep in these important preparations can lead to major problems down the road, when retailer web and mobile sites buckle under huge volumes of traffic and experience outages, resulting in lost revenue and tarnished brand images.\nIn fact, a recent survey of more than 1,000 Americans revealed that 52% of US consumers already expect retailers to have a major outage during the holiday shopping season \u2013 with Walmart (23%), BestBuy (17%), Macy\u2019s (16%) and Target (16%) noted as having the most risk of crashing.\nTo keep retailers\u2019 applications running smoothly, IT and Ops teams should follow a checklist to help them hit their targets throughout the year so they are ready for extreme scalability and continuous IT operations when the big shopping days hit. The biggest online shopping days this season are expected to be Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Green Monday, Free Shipping Day and Super Saturday.\nHere is what IT and Ops teams should have already checked off their list this year:\nBuild for high availability and resiliency: You want to ensure that your infrastructure can scale beyond your expectations of traffic and incorporates a high availability (HA) strategy that also delivers resiliency in case of server failure \u2013 be that web server, app server, or database server.\nWeb load balancers have proven invaluable for enabling resiliency at the web tier: With connection management, load distribution, and the ability to detect and route around downed web servers, these devices have enabled zero downtime at the web tier. The data tier is the next frontier.\nInvestigate how technologies such as database load balancing software can shield your apps \u2013 and therefore your customers \u2013 from database downtime, enabling zero downtime at the app tier.\nAdd new features and new technology: If you have major infrastructure or architecture upgrades to do, this is the time. Even if these features and technologies do not apply specifically to Black Friday efforts, you need to get them into play so you know how they affect the entire system.\nWork towards a goal of zero downtime: Seamless and immediate database failover is central to achieving zero downtime. Keeping your customers logged in and productive is paramount to Black Friday sales numbers.\nReview your infrastructure with an eye toward avoiding downtime from maintenance windows: This approach includes maintenance for adding new services. Because database load balancing software is transparent to the application layer, no application changes are required to scale, optimize, or add resiliency to new or existing applications and services.\nAnd here is what IT and Ops teams should be doing now to prep for Black Friday:\nJuly\nIncrease site performance: It\u2019s time to rev up the engine that will boost site performance to easily handle Black Friday traffic loads, delivering consistent and excellent customer experience. When it comes to databases, application performance bottlenecks tend to fall into three main categories: 1. poor query performance, 2. lack of concurrent capacity to handle high user loads, and 3. connection pooling / management issues. Look for technologies that can address these challenges capabilities.\nAugust/September\nImplement the system freeze and test all components: August is the time to stop making changes to your infrastructure. While most organizations have to occasionally accept last-minute updates beyond this point in time, most components should enter a freeze now.\nThis time is also good for delving into analytics again to see where you have potential weaknesses in the system: Start applying load tests to see how all your infrastructure changes are holding up. Testing at high load now gives you time to address any issues you uncover.\nOctober\nSee how natural load increases are affecting your system: By early October, you\u2019ll likely start to see traffic increase on a daily basis. Natural traffic growth can provide a better test backdrop than they load testing you engineer because it typically reveals surprises. Your Black Friday preparations should all be in place by now.\nNovember\nAnalyze the traffic: Organizations with high Black Friday loads report Black Friday traffic being a 10X to 15X spike over rest-of-year numbers. Some organizations see as much as a 5X spike on Black Friday compared to Thanksgiving Thursday \u2013 it can be a dramatic traffic ramp.\nMake any last-minute adjustments: If you\u2019ve been leveraging analytics throughout the year, any last-minute adjustments should be minor, and most likely based on an unexpected traffic increase in October that signals higher traffic rates on Black Friday.\nDecember\nYou made it! Wipe your brow, grab a beer and evaluate what just happened \u2013 it\u2019s time for the postmortem. Robust analytics with troubleshooting tools are paramount. Now is also the time to schedule January priorities.\nOnline retailers who follow these steps will be ready for the onslaught of traffic that will come their way this holiday shopping season. This will mean continuous uptime of their web and mobile sites, happy and returning customers and more revenue.\nMichelle McLean, VP of Marketing, ScaleArc\nImage Credit: Pretty Vectors / Shutterstock\n}}
{{It'd have been impossible to ignore, if you were driving home from your Thanksgiving festivities or at least tuned into the news, the long lines of people camped out in front of malls, big box stores and retailers otherwise, waiting patiently for the doors to open and thus begin Black Friday. And while the eager consumers have been easy targets for jokes and criticism from late night hosts, twitter comedians and those Pilgrim-saluting traditionalists that sat comfortably in their living room and looked down on those that forwent vaunted family time to get in early shopping, the coupon-driven pandemonium is less a joking matter than a symptom of the desperate economic situation so many Americans are facing this holiday season.\nBlack Friday, for many stores and customers, became pitch Black Thursday night, as big box chains such as Best Buy and Toys R' Us welcomed in shoppers on Thanksgiving evening; other stores opened in the wee hours of the morning, with people lined up on the sidewalk in the cold to get first crack at sales. What those who criticize and poke fun at the deal-starved camper don't consider is that many of them weren't there for the sport of it -- it's a necessity.\nWith massive unemployment draining consumer spending, Americans are searching for every deal they can get. The twisted part is that to get them, they're forced to sacrifice their nights of sleep and warm beds to sit outside the massive chain stores that have closed down so many small businesses, to buy products that are generally produced overseas.\nIt's a sick system that robs middle class Americans of their money, then forces them to pay with their time to grab a sliver of that cash back. It almost seems like a premise of an Onion article, especially in light of the fact that higher end retailers are doing far less Black Friday promotion than in past years, knowing their wealthier consumers don't need much help these days.\nStill, regardless of whether it's done at mom and pop shops or three-story megastores, consumer spending drives our economy. So what's been especially disappointing is how much of the left has responded to the Black Friday madness with disdain.\nWhile I've been a great admirer of the efforts of Occupy Wall Street, including their \"Move Your Money\" push to drive deposits from big banks to community credit unions, their boycott of spending today is ill-conceived. Great structural inequities in how businesses compete must be addressed, but in the immediate future, a strong retail holiday season will only mean good things for the economy, stifling job cuts and maybe even spurring hiring. If possible, it's very important to buy American made goods at small stores, but for many, that's simply -- and sadly -- not an available option.\nIn fact, while it may seem silly at first to compare those camping out in Occupy sites throughout the world with those that spent the night under tents in front of stores, aren't they both just looking for a fair shot in this economy? Both groups, it seems to me, are victims of the vast inequities of our system today -- right down to the pepper spray assaults.\n}}
{{The busiest shopping day of the year varies each year for retailers, according Missouri Retailers Association President Dave Overfelt. He says Black Friday is traditionally the busiest day of the year, but sometimes it\u2019s the weekend before Christmas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s competition and with the competition, they\u2019re going to want to get their people in the stores and move their merchandise,\u201d says Overfelt.\nThe National Retail Federation says an estimated six in 10 Americans will do their holiday shopping during this Thanksgiving weekend.\nOverfelt expects deep discounts to continue throughout the holidays.\nSome economists expect in-store holiday sales will increase 4 to 5% this season compared to 2015. Online shopping is expected to grow 7 to 10% in November and December compared to the same time period last year.\nGift card sales are expected to grow this holiday shopping season.Overfelt expects traditional toys like Barbies, dolls, GI Joe, Legos and Hot Wheels to be favorites.\nFree shipping options are expected to be offered more than ever this holiday shopping season.\nRetailers are expected to hire between 640,000 and 690,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, which is in line with last year\u2019s 675,300 holiday positions.\nMissouri\u2019s unemployment rate dropped one-tenth of a percent in October to 5.1%. Overfelt says the latest unemployment figures show an increase in part-time work but a decline in full-time work. He says seasonal holiday employment generally helps with unemployment figures.\n\u201cSome of those jobs become full-time but some people do not want to keep those as full-time jobs. They take them as a part-time job to save money for something particular. It could be travel in the winter. It could be toys and Christmas,\u201d says Overfelt.\nHe says the decline in full-time figures could be a result of a federal overtime rule that requires overtime pay for some salaried workers.\n}}
{{Walmart workers, who have been agitating peacefully for years for pro-worker changes at the notoriously anti-worker low-paying lousy-benefits retail monster, are again planning mass protests at their stores nationwide on \u201cBlack Friday,\u201d the big shopping day immediately after Thanksgiving.\nThe activists, members of Our Walmart, set their plans in motion after Walmart pressured police in D.C. and New York City to arrest 42 people on October 17. Arrestees were demonstrating outside the D.C. office of Walmart\u2019s foundation and outside a Park Avenue penthouse that a rich Walmart co-owner/family member just bought in Manhattan.\nProtesters demanded Walmart stop using taxpayer funds \u2013 calculated at $7.8 billion annually for food stamps, Medicaid, housing subsidies and more \u2013 to support its low wages.\nAnd they delivered a petition to firm chairman Rob Walton and to the foundation office, demanding the company pay its workers a living wage of $15 an hour, and provide full-time (40 hour) workweeks on predictable schedules. That would let them find child care, pay their bills and raise their kids normally. If Walmart refuses, the Black Friday protests will go ahead as planned.\nThe Walmart workers are a leading sector of the mass movement of low-wage workers nationwide \u2013 retail workers, port truckers, fast-food workers, warehouse workers and others \u2013 who have had it with low wages, no benefits and company oppression of their rights.\nMillions of those workers, like the Walmart workers, have taken the streets demanding a living wage, decent working conditions and benefits, regular hours and the right to organize without employer interference and law-breaking.\nWalmart\u2019s wages are usually below $10 hourly and often below $9. And it defines \u201cfull-time\u201d as 30 hours a week. Last year, Walmart\u2019s former CEO admitted most Walmart workers are paid less than $25,000 each yearly. The low-pay few-hours combination usually means Walmart workers cannot afford the firm\u2019s high-cost health insurance, either.\nWorkers who have protested Walmart\u2019s conditions have been met by massive company repression, illegal firings and other labor law-breaking. A Cornell University study showed at least 288 federal labor law-breaking citations against Walmart in the last five years.\nThe protesters made it clear that Walmart\u2019s wages and working conditions are totally inadequate to support families. Protests occurred at Walmart stores and other sites nationwide on October 17, though arrests occurred only in New York and D.C.\nWorkers from 1,710 Walmart stores, located in each state, signed the petition to Rob Walton. \u201cThe Waltons have made it impossible for me to get ahead and make sure my daughter goes to bed in a warm home,\u201d said Fatmata Jabbie, a Walmart worker who delivered a copy to the foundation\u2019s D.C. office. \u201cMy grandkids go hungry because of low pay at Wal-Mart,\u201d added Sandra Sok, a Walmart worker in Phoenix.\n\u201cWe are tired of seeing the Waltons enjoy every luxury this world can offer while the workers that build their wealth are unable to pay their bills,\u201d said Interfaith Worker Justice Executive Director Kim Bobo. \u201cIncome inequality will only be addressed when the Waltons and Walmart provide fair pay and regular hours to their workers. I\u2019m here today taking a stand for Walmart workers, and I\u2019ll be back on Black Friday with thousands of others who have had enough of Wal-Mart\u2019s destruction of the American Dream.\u201d\nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who spoke at the D.C. protest, noted that \u201cWalmart alone rakes in $16 billion a year while enjoying $8 billion in tax breaks and subsidies, but refuses to pay employees enough to put food on the table or clothes on their back. Many employees are forced to rely on taxpayer-funded programs, meaning taxpayers are paying for the Walton family\u2019s refusal to pay a decent wage. It\u2019s time to end this scam, and ensure all workers have the decency of a livable wage and full-time work.\u201d\nPhoto: This is what $15/hour and full time would mean for Our Walmart Southern California member Nikki.

{{U.S. online and bricks-and-mortar retailers are reporting solid sales for Black Friday Weekend, although bad weather in parts of the country are putting something of a damper on things.\n\"Retail sales are off to a good start, though it appears that some areas of cold weather in the East and wet weather in the West may have driven some sales volume online, especially in the department store sector early [Friday] morning,\" credit-card giant Mastercard (MA) said in a statement. \"Generally, online sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick-and-mortar sales to help the overall sales figures out a bit there.\"\nOnline giant Amazon (AMZN) added that \"this Black Friday is already on pace to surpass Black Friday last year in terms of items ordered. In just the first nine hours of Black Friday, Amazon customers have ordered more than 1 million toys and more than 700,000 fashion items.\"\nAmazon reports that hot items this Black Friday include a complete Harry Potter collection on Blu-Ray.\nAmazon said top-selling items so far include:\nThe new Echo Dot;\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K with all-new Alexa Voice Remote;\nThe Fire 7 Tablet;\nThe Instant Pot DUO80 8 Quart;\nThe Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat;\nThe Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection on Blu-Ray.\nBlack Friday marks not only the traditional beginning of the holiday-shopping season, but also a key shopping period that includes Nov. 24's \"Small Business Saturday\" (special promotions by small local retailers) and Nov. 26's Cyber Monday, when online retailers offer generous deals. Some stores even opened on Thursday -- Thanksgiving evening -- to give shoppers a head start.\nThe National Retail Federation predicts some 164 million Americans will shop during the five-day Thanksgiving break from Thursday through Monday. \"Whether it's heading to the stores after finishing their turkey or going online on Cyber Monday, consumers will be shopping all weekend and retailers will be ready to meet the demand,\" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said.\nAll told, the NRF predicts that U.S. consumers will spend as much as $721 billion this holiday season. That's up 4.8% from last year.\nMastercard expects that when retailers count up their receipts, U.S. consumers will have spent around $23 billion on Black Friday alone vs. about $21 billion last year. By contrast, the average holiday-shopping day only sees some $15 billion in sales, the cred-card firm said.\nHowever, this year's season has already been marred with problems. In Hoover, Ala., police shot and killed what they iniitlally thought was a gunman after someone opened fire late Thursday night during an altercation at the Riverchase Galleria mall. However, police later said that while the dead man might have been involved \"in some aspect\" of the incident, they now think the real gunman remains at large. Local media reported that the initial shooting injured two people, including a 12 year-old girl.\nMeanwhile, unions in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom staged walk-outs or other demonstrations at eight Amazon fulfillment centers to protest alleged repetitive-stress injuries and other problems for employees.\n\"I've seen too many people starting healthy and now having their second or third surgery already,\" said Andreja Schmidtkunz, one of the German Amazon workers protesting against the online giant. \"You start at the company healthy and leave it as a broken human.\"\nRetailers' stocks also mostly fell during Friday's shortened trading session on Wall Street, losing even more than the S&P 500's 0.66% decline.

{{(Adds details, analyst quote)\nJOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s retail sales rose slower than expected in January, data showed on Thursday, after a sharp rise in the final months of 2017 as the effect of Black Friday wore off.\nRetail sales rose by 3.1 percent year-on-year in January, after increasing by a revised 5.1 percent in December and 7.9 percent the month before that, the statistics office said.\nSales by general dealers and retailers took the biggest knock, while those in cosmetics also fell, the data showed.\nAnalysts said that an increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) due to start in April would slow down sales further.\nUnder new President Cyril Ramaphosa the Treasury took the politically risky step of raising VAT for the first time in 25 years in bid increase revenues and slash the budget deficit.\nKevin Lings, chief economist at Stanlib, said: \u201cWe might however see some buoyancy in March as people try to get ahead of the VAT increase and then the April number may suffer as a consequence.\u201d\nOn the depressed sales in January, Lings said it was a result of a slump in sales after the Black Friday sales.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Black Friday effect. This is the second year we\u2019ve had strong sales in November and December, and then the consumer almost takes a breather into the second half of December and further than that,\u201d he said.\nFurther gains in consumer confidence after Ramaphosa became president and an anticipated cut in lending rates next week could cushion the impact on sales after the VAT increase.

We take a look at the best ways you can avoid being caught-out.\nGetty Images - Getty 2 Black Friday 2017 is now less than a month away\nWhen is this year's Black Friday?\nThe shopping extravaganza originates from the US but has become part of the UK's shopping scene in recent years as retailers slash prices on a huge range of goods.\nThe day has been marred by violence as shoppers have fought over discounted TVs, gadgets and more but that hasn't stopped savvy savers from picking-up great deals both in store and online.\nThe date of this year's Black Friday is Friday, November 24 but many retailers will be having sales in the week before the big day, so make sure you're keeping an eye out.\nHow do I know what's on offer is a bargain?\nIt might look you're getting a real bargain when you're in a shopping frenzy but often discounts aren't as impressive as they first appear.\nIn fact, research from consumer group Which? found half of 178 deals were actually cheaper on another day in the three months before and two months after Black Friday 2015.\nOnly 8 per cent of the deals it looked at were the cheapest on Black Friday.\nGetty Images - Getty 2 Some Black Friday bargains might not be as good as they first appear\nThe Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) has also warned retailers their sales claims must be \"genuine and accurate\" and must not \"exaggerate\" the savings that could be made.\nTo stop yourself being suckered-in by a sneaky offer, do your own research.\nHelpfully, there are a number of websites you can use to check price data of items you are wanting to buy, so you can see if it is a real bargain or not.\nCamelCamelCamel lets you search the price history for all items on Amazon and Pricehistory lets you track prices at Argos.\nAnd of course, shop around.\nCheck the price of the items you're after at a few shops and websites to see where you can get it cheapest, so you'll know if you're actually getting a decent deal.\nHow can I get the best discounts?\nIt really pays to be prepared before the day itself.\nCreate accounts on the retailers' websites you want to use to save time and sign-up to their newsletters as they'll be keen to shout about their best deals.\nIt's also worth following shops on Facebook and Twitter to see what prices their slashing.\nIf you want to be extra clever, try adding items you want to your basket before the day.\nThat way, the items will already be reduced in your basket and ready to go.\nAnd there's no way around it - if you want the very best deals it pays to do your shopping as early as possible.\nThe very best deals are likely to go as soon as they go on sale - either online or when the shop opens - so be ready for a late night or early start.\nAnd remember - be sensible.\nDon't be tempted to buy things you don't need and might not save you much money anyway.\nOur top tips to avoid online fraud this Black Friday THE inevitable surge in online shopping over Black Friday and Cyber Monday makes it a prime target for online fraudsters. Here's our advice on how to stay safe online... Firstly, remember that if something seems too good to be true, it normally is.\nIf you like to interact with brands on social media, check they are \u201cverified\u201d. On Facebook and Twitter pages, this means the company will have a blue tick on their profile.\nAs a general rule, verified status means the account should be legitimate.\nLook for grammatical and spelling errors; fraudsters are notoriously bad at writing proper English.\nIf you receive a message from a \u201cfriend\u201d informing you of a freebie, consider whether it\u2019s written in your friend\u2019s normal style.\nIf you\u2019re invited to click on an URL, hover over the link to see the address it will take you to \u2013 does it look genuine?\nTo be on the really safe side, don\u2019t click on unsolicited links in messages, even if they appear to come from a trusted contact.\nBe careful when opening email attachments too. Fraudsters are increasingly attaching files, usually PDFs or spreadsheets, which contain dangerous malware.\nIf you receive a suspicious message then report it to the company it came from, block the sender and delete it.\nHow to bag the best Black Friday 2017 bargains\nMore on money AISLE STOP IN Inside the new smaller Aldi Local as it opens up first branch WE CAN BE HEROES Cadbury is adding TWO new chocolates to its Heroes boxes EVERY LITTLE HELPS Tesco insider reveals store secrets & all the things they CAN'T tell you MONSTER TREAT Forget Colin!

{{As you gear up to accomplish your holiday shopping this year, you may be more focused on doing so through online retailers than ever before. Ever since the breach of Target\u2019s payment systems just before Christmas last year, which made international headlines, consumers have had to endure story after story about leading global retailers having credit cards and personal information stolen from their customers.\nWhile online shopping may seem less dangerous than shopping at big-box retailers these days, don\u2019t be fooled about the inherent safety of online shopping. Attackers can still access important details from you if you aren\u2019t cautious. Be proactive about your financial security this holiday shopping season and follow these five tips to keep you safe on black Friday.\n1) Pre-paid credit cards\nIf a financial card breach concerns you, one of the easiest ways to mitigate financial risk is to use a card that has temporary usage, such as a pre-paid credit card. By purchasing pre-paid credit cards (usually for free) the purchases you make online (or in store) won\u2019t be attached to your primary credit card number that you may use to pay your bills online or for daily use. Pre-paid cards are also not attached to your financial institution, so you don\u2019t need to be concerned about an attacker accessing your bank accounts. If the card was stolen, the thief wouldn\u2019t be able to access your money and there is no risk attached for you.\nSome financial institutions, such as Bank of America, offer temporary credit card numbers for usage online that don\u2019t require you to physically acquire a pre-paid card.\n2) HTTPS everywhere\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s been a rather rough year for the security of SSL and TLS, the underlying standards that protect your website communications when shopping on the Internet. However, that\u2019s no reason to give up hope! Secure communications between you and the web server you are speaking with helps to prevent a number of attacks, especially when doing some on untrusted networks at places like coffee shops or university libraries.\nThe stalwart defenders of all things digital rights, the EFF, provide a browser extension called \u201cHTTPS Everywhere.\u201d This extension ensures that sites you are communicating with always leverage encrypted communications (when able). This prevents attackers from being able to manipulate your web traffic to make you feel that the network is secure and offer up sensitive data you believe to be safe. The best part? It\u2019s free!\n3) Fraud notifications\nOne aspect to information security that many people don\u2019t think about until it\u2019s too late is the ability to respond to fraud quickly. A problem that goes on for a day versus a month could be a big difference to your credit history and financial accounts. Companies such as American Express will even let you use their mobile application to receive fraud notices and respond, all without having to make a phone call.\nCheck with your financial institutions as to their ability to enable fraud alerts and what the thresholds are. Some companies may let you get an alert if spending goes over a certain dollar amount to make you more aware of when big transactions occur so that you can vet them easier. Being aware of how your money is being used is a great first step in resolving fraud when it happens.\n4) Password manager\nIt can\u2019t be overstated how much a bad or poorly secured password can ruin your day. Whether through phishing, brute force, or password reuse, criminals love to gain access to your credentials in order to steal money, buy goods, and, in general, steal your digital identity.\nWith the seemingly endless number of sites to provide a password for, using a password manager such as 1Password or LastPass is a quick way to regain your sanity and security. By randomly generating unique passwords for each website, you reduce the risk of one stolen password compromising security in other areas of your life. Password managers these days usually alert you when you are using a weak password or reusing a password that was used on an at-risk site, for instance: a website that was recently breached.\n5) Patch your system\nMany of us are still running operating systems or web browsers that were last updated two or more years ago, which puts us highly at risk. The number of vulnerabilities that can impact browser security, either natively or via plugins like Flash, is overwhelming. An updated and well-patched system can quickly and easily prevent us from potential risks while shopping online. So, make sure to download all updates on your computer. While you\u2019re at it, schedule automatic updates so that they happen regularly and often, without any input from your end.\nFinal though: Don\u2019t be a victim\nWith Black Friday just around the corner, these simple tips can help you keep your account information safe throughout the busy holiday shopping season. Since retail data breaches seem to be an inevitability, consumers need to empower themselves to protect their financial accounts, and this starts with monitoring for any suspicious activity and understanding the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of holiday shopping.\nCertainly, retail organizations will have an eye on security after major data breaches at leading global brands such as Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot and Michael\u2019s have led to negative headlines over the past year. But these five tips are a good start toward your own personal data security and making sure that you, and your personal information, aren\u2019t a victim in the next round of headlines.\nMark Stanislav is a security researcher at Duo Security.\n}}

{{Black Friday is days away and we have a feeling there are going to be a lot of tired ladies out there early Friday morning. Don\u2019t hit the sales before checking out our Black Friday beauty preparation tips!\nAvoid a hairy situation\nt\nThe last thing you want to think about at the crack of dawn this Black Friday is what to do with your hair! To avoid a hair disaster the morning of, prepare the night before.\nInstead of waking up in the morning and washing your locks, wash the night before and throw in a little texturizing cream \u2014 we like Bb. Texture Hair (Un) Dressing Cr\u00e8me from Bumble and Bumble (sephora.com, $26) \u2014 to create gorgeous texture for the next day.\nOr, if your hair is dry Thanksgiving night and you can hardly summon the energy to drag yourself into bed (never mind wash your hair!), braid your hair to create loose waves. Secure with snag-free elastics like Goody Ouchless Elastics (drugstore.com, $3) and you\u2019ll be good to go on Black Friday!\nIf your hair is looking a little worse for the wear in the morning, a great go-to beauty product is Fresh Start Smoothing Dry Shampoo from Tresemme (www.target.com, $5). Spray it in your hair and look fresh and clean in under 5 minutes.\nNail the deals with ease\nWe know that long, fake nails are fun to wear, but they\u2019re also a pain in the butt when you\u2019re grabbing deal after deal on Black Friday! Avoid any broken nail trauma this Black Friday and go natural with your nails. You don\u2019t have to forgo polish, ladies. In fact, we recommend painting your nails for Black Friday in this pretty Heart of Gold shade from Topshop (topshop.com, $10).\nMake shopping bags the only bags you\u2019re holding\nBlack Friday leaves us beauties very little time to apply a full face of makeup and some of us are lucky if we can even manage to swipe on some concealer after missing (err, ignoring) our early morning wake-up call. Spare yourself a few minutes of concealer application (after all, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll need some, considering you hardly slept) by prepping your peepers. Avoiding salt can help reduce dark circles and so can some good old-fashioned shuteye! Do yourself a favor for Black Friday and hit the sheets a tad early, avoid late night leftover noshing and consider popping on some soothing eye pads like Recover-E Cucumber Eye Pads (ulta.com, $5) before you go to bed.\nMore Black Friday\nAmazon Black Friday deals all week\nH&M Black Friday deals\nBlack Friday opening hours for major retailers\n}}
{{With Black Friday sales beginning on Thanksgiving for many retailers, Walmart and Target are getting the ball rolling with a variety of new events that experts say are intended to draw online shoppers and seize upon the first holiday season without a beloved children's toy haven.\nWalmart recently announced its first-ever \u201cLight Up Black Friday\u201d parties in stores at 4 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Walmart also added 30 percent more toys to its brick-and-mortar locations.\nThe retail giant is hoping to make holiday shopping as convenient as possible for this generation of customers, writing in a press release that with its early sales, festive events and color-coded store maps, \"it\u2019s never been easier for customers to shop \u2013 and save \u2013 at Walmart on Black Friday.\u201d\nAnd Target vowed to organize in-store experiences around the newly added quarter-million square feet of space dedicated to toys across more than 500 stores, according to CNBC. The retailer also promised to host 25,000 hours of in-store events later in the year, with many events allowing children to play with new toys.\nTarget's executive vice president said that for customers with a top priority of \"finding the perfect toy to wrap up and give their little loved ones this holiday, ... We want them to know that Target is here to help.\"\nBoth retailers are even deploying staff members throughout the stores to help shoppers beat long lines and check out the customers with mobile devices.\nWith the increased number of in-store holiday events, some experts say Walmart and Target are trying to combat the growing influence Amazon and other online retailers have over consumers. And playing an important role in their competition with online retailers is their new focus on toy sales during the first holiday season after the closure of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.\nSridhar Balasubramanian, a professor of marketing and Roy and Alice H. Richards Bicentennial Distinguished Scholar at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the extensive marketing campaigns are in response to how much Black Friday shopping has changed due to the growing popularity of online retailers.\nCrowds have traditionally flocked to stores on Black Friday, waiting in line for hours to get access to long-awaited holiday deals, Balasubramanian said. But Amazon, \"the 800 lb. gorilla of the online market,\" Balasubramanian added, has made those deals available all the time.\n\u201cWith online [shopping], you lose the sense of shopping at a particular time and at a particular place,\u201d Balasubramanian said. \u201cThat convenience is something that traditional retailers have really struggled to recreate.\u201d\nLook Back: The Most Popular Toys of Holidays Past\nFrom Cabbage Patch Kids to Hatchimals, here are 8 of the best-selling toys of holiday shopping seasons past. (Published Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018)\nIn Deloitte\u2019s \u201c2018 Retail Holiday Survey,\u201d 66 percent of customers said they would go shopping online versus 56 percent who said they\u2019d shop in-store. Respondents ranked convenience, free-shipping and time saving as the top three reasons to shop online.\nKatrijn Gielens, an associate professor of marketing and Sarah Graham Kenan Scholar at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said online shopping has made it increasingly difficult to attract customers into stores. For example, it is easier to avoid the impulse buying of additional items while shopping online.\nGielens added that stores have had to turn to strategies like in-store events to court customers, and targeting toys allow the whole family to get involved in the shopping process.\n\u201cOnce they\u2019re inside the store you can tempt them with other things and that is the ultimate goal to a certain extent,\u201d Gielens said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one type of consumer that is easily tempted, it\u2019s probably children. Ultimately, the parents will pay for it, but it\u2019s also hard to say no to children.\u201d\nBalasubramanian said that because children have a different perspective of shopping than adults do and that the in-store experience is more meaningful to young children than online shopping is.\n\u201cWith children, it is often a ritual to go to the store with their parents and have all the excitement around them \u2014 to touch, feel, experience the toys \u2014 and then to get something right then and there,\u201d Balasubramanian said. \u201cThat makes it fun for the family.\u201d\nBalasubramanian said that Walmart and Target\u2019s event-heavy, child-friendly marketing strategies also seem to be an \u201cexperiment\u201d to see if they can capture Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019 former customers year-round and increase their presence in the toy market.\n\u201cI would certainly expect that some of the traffic from Toys 'R' Us is going to go definitely toward Walmart and Target,\u201d Balasubramanian said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear to me that given how shopping habits have been shifting that Walmart and Target are necessarily going to capture all of the Toys 'R' Us\u2019 traditional customers.\u201d\nBalasubramanian noted that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us went out of business because its toy-only model could not compete with Amazon and other online retailers, who took over \u201ca big chunk of that toy market.\u201d Balasubramanian said, however, that because Walmart and Target\u2019s offerings cover a wide range of categories, their current business \u201cwill remain robust\u201d even if they can\u2019t increase their toy sales.\nPhotos The 2018 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book Is Here\nAlthough Gielens thinks the events could bolster the number of in-store visits on Black Friday, she said \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on whether the strategy would be useful in the long-run. She warned that retailers should not market the events and toys to the point that consumers are distracted from looking through the rest of the store.\nGielens also noted that because these events promote products at lower prices, the stores\u2019 profits might be affected. Gielens acknowledged that the retailers are being forced to take the risk to beat their competitors, but she advised that the companies should organize the events in such a way that they don\u2019t lose money.\n\u201cUltimately, what are [the stores] all trying to achieve: that they don\u2019t lose market share and that they don\u2019t lose their consumer to their competitors,\u201d Gielens said. \u201cBut it can accommodate huge costs in that it\u2019s simply not profitable.\u201d\n}}
{{To find the best deals on Black Friday, you have to have a game plan; you can\u2019t just stroll into the store at noon and expect to find what you want. Follow these Black Friday strategies and tips to get the best bargains and reduce your holiday shopping stress.\nCarry a shopping list\nSpend some time researching and create a detailed shopping list. When you get to the stores, stick to it. \u201cKnow exactly what you want. The best Black Friday deals are in very limited supply, which is why you should never enter a store and just be window shopping,\u201d says Service Strategist John Tschohl, author of The Customer is Boss. \u201cHave a detailed list of everything you want to get. To save valuable time, make sure you know ahead of time the differences in models, the need for any add-ons or accessories, and a backup store if your first stop runs out.\u201d There are apps available for your smartphone that will generate your wishlist for you and keep everything organized so you don\u2019t have to worry about losing it.\nSort by category\nSort your list by category according to the areas of the store. When shopping at big-box and department stores, your best bet is to go with two friends. One of you heads to the back of the store, one takes the middle section, and one remains near the front. This way, you won\u2019t miss out on the Black Friday deals in electronics because you are caught up in kids\u2019 clothing. Head to the story a few days in advance to map out your path of attack so you know exactly where everything is.\nHire someone else to camp out\nDiscounted electronics and other items are in very limited quantities on Black Friday, so you have to be near the front of the line. If you don\u2019t want to spend the night on the cold, freezing sidewalk, hire a trustworthy teen from your neighborhood to wait in line for you. Give her $50, a thermos with a hot drink or soup, and a blanket; tell her to bring a book (or her iPod). While she holds position in the line, you can catch some sleep and arrive right before the store actually opens.\nDon\u2019t give in to temptation\nIf you don\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for on Black Friday, don\u2019t be tempted to buy whatever is on sale. This is how you end up overspending on junk you don\u2019t really want or need. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the deals you want on Black Friday, wait,\u201d says Tschohl. \u201cRetailers usually run special sales the first two weeks of December. Prices generally go up closer to Christmas for those who wait until the last minute. If you\u2019re eyeing something for yourself, many retailers also run deeply discounted after-Christmas sales to reduce their inventories.\u201d Also be aware of false sales. Some retailers will advertise low prices that actually aren\u2019t any lower than the original price, they just want to move the product. Do your research ahead of time so you get the best deals possible.\nMore Black Friday deals >>\nMore about Black Friday\nAmazon Black Friday deals all week\nH&M Black Friday deals\nBlack Friday opening hours for major retailers\n}}

{{Online spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday was up two per cent on last year\nOnline spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday has shown a slight rise, partially allaying fears of an overall slump in internet sales.\nSpending was up two per cent on last year which, while not much, was better than some were expecting. Overall Americans spent $822m (\u00a3553m) in the 48-hour period, according to internet monitoring firm comScore.\n\"Early reports suggest that Black Friday sales in retail stores were slightly better than anticipated in this depressed retail climate, and this performance apparently extended to the online channel which saw sales on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday combined increase two per cent versus a year ago,\" said comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni.\n\"It is probable that on Black Friday consumers responded positively to the very aggressive promotions and discounts being offered in retail stores, so it will be important to see how they respond to similarly attractive deals being offered online on Cyber Monday, the traditional kick-off to the online holiday shopping season.\"\nHowever, many commentators are worried that, while spending will be up, profits for sellers may be falling. This year saw huge savings offered both online and offline, including HP cutting the price of some notebooks by up to 40 per cent.\nCyber Monday is seen as an important bellwether for the retail industry. In the past three years the spending growth rate for that day has mirrored the figure for the entire holiday season to within an average of less than one per cent.\n\"With so much volatility right now in the variables that influence consumer spending, predicting where this online holiday season will end up has been far more challenging than in previous years,\" said Fulgoni.\n\"That said, Cyber Monday may well prove to be an important indicator of whether the decline in spending during the first few weeks of the online holiday season will continue for the balance of the year.\"\n}}
{{Black Friday is just a month away, and many shoppers are already making plans for what they're going to try to grab at deep discount. So we checked with the experts at DealNews.com to see where the biggest markdowns will be this year when it comes to high-tech TVs, phones, gaming systems and more.\n1. TV Deals\nDealNews says if you've been thinking about upgrading to a 4K TV, Black Friday (or the days immediately after) is a great time to do it. Their report says 4K prices will hit record lows, with 60-inch sets as low as $429. They're expecting 4K prices to be somewhat comparable to 1080p HD sets. It predicts 40-inch 4K TVs will be priced as low as $170. Note, however, that these are \"doorbuster\" prices, which means you may have to stand in line on Thanksgiving Day to get the rock-bottom price. Prices may be higher on Friday during the day. DealNews also predicts Best Buy will have the lowest prices on name brand TVs such as Samsung, Sony and LG. Walmart and Target typically have their lowest prices on off-brand TVs such as Element.\n2. Smartphones\nIt's also a great time to shop for an iPhone. DealNews expects carriers to offer iPhone 7s for as low as $1 with a contract. It says while you won't find markdowns on the new iPhone 8 (Apple discourages discounts on new products), look for up to $250 in bonus gift cards with the purchase of a new iPhone 8 on Black Friday. It says don't expect any discounts on the brand new iPhone X, which will be in short supply. Samsung's Galaxy S8 should sell for $350 or less. Look for bonus gift cards with this phone, too. HTC and other Android smartphones may be free with a contract.\n3. Game Consoles\nIn gaming, DealNews says to look for hot games at half-price, from $25 and up. And you can expect to see last year's Xbox One and Sony PS4 bundles as low as $179. DealNews expects to see PS4 Slim bundles for $249. The new XBox One X will be released Nov. 7, so don't expect much in the way of deals.\n4. iPads and Tablets\nDealNews predicts you will find the current generation 9.7-inch iPad starting at $204, with the Amazon Fire HD as low as $50. It also says checks Best Buy, Target, and Walmart for iPad deals, instead of the Apple Store.\n5. Laptops and Chromebooks\nIf you are in the market for a laptop, DealNews expects to see Chromebooks as low as $99, and budget laptops as low as $110. However, if you plan to play games or do any video editing on your laptop, you would be best to avoid those dirt-cheap devices. DealNews says look for mainstream laptops starting at $300.\nTiming of Deals\nDealNews says there is no need to panic if you miss the Thursday night blowout deals. Except for those big screen 4K TVs you may find prices just as low in the days after Black Friday. In recent years, gaming systems stayed at Black Friday prices into early December. And toys are often cheaper two weeks later. If you stand in line for two hours, then find the same item cheaper three days later on Cyber Monday, you'll be one frustrated shopper. That's why if you are planning a big electronics purchase, you should check all the online prices first, and pay special attention to Cyber Monday ads. You don't want your great Black Friday find to be a bad deal come Monday morning.\nThis story originally appeared on Don't Waste Your Money .

{{It\u2019s Thanksgiving week and that means more than just turkey, football and family; it means shopping. Black Friday is the biggest shopping day of the year, and some dedicated shoppers are getting a head start \u2014 a big head start.\nSavvy shoppers or just plain crazy?\nIt may only be Monday, but dedicated Black Friday shoppers are already camping out at major retailers around the country.\nAccording to ABC Channel 7 and other news outlets, people are already beginning to camp out in front of retailers such as the Best Buy in Fort Myers, Florida. And it\u2019s not just a couple of people with blankets and sleeping bags. There are tents, mattresses, TVs, generators and more. Some of the patrons will even be making Thanksgiving dinner right there outside the store.\nSome Fort Myers shoppers aren\u2019t new to sleeping on the sidewalks in the days leading up to Black Friday. Sean Kelley and his family have been first in line at the Best Buy for the past six years. However, this year, they lost their place to the Valentin family.\nSavvy or crazy?\nSome people call them savvy shoppers, while others think the campers around the country are just crazy.\n\u201cHow smart is it to miss a week\u2019s worth of work just to save a few hundred dollars?\u201d asks Texas mom Veronica Garcia. \u201cYou can get a lot of deals online too \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to even leave your house.\u201d\nThough it does seem a little crazy, there are deals to be had. If you are going to be making large purchases on things such as electronics, it may be worth your time. Only you can decide how much your time is worth.\nGray Thursday\nOver the years, Black Friday has slowly become Gray Thursday, with stores opening up earlier and earlier. Most major retailers, such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, now open at midnight or earlier. At some stores, deals start on Thanksgiving Day in the evening, cutting into holiday and family time. Walmart has doorbuster specials starting at 8 p.m. Sears and Kmart do the same, with Target starting an hour later at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving evening.\nNo matter when you start your Black Friday shopping, arm yourself with a game plan and some research.

{{Last Friday, LinkedIn, Salesforce and Workday lost $18B in market capitalization. To put that in perspective, these three SaaS companies lost more in market cap on Friday than 15 current SaaS leaders are worth\u2026combined.\nHow can this be possible? LinkedIn, Salesforce and Workday are growing revenue with sticky customers and they are targeting large addressable markets. Are they now suddenly undesirable companies?\nInvestors Paid Yesterday for Today\u2019s Growth\nOn the contrary, public SaaS companies have largely met growth expectations and performed according to Wall St. expectations. The problem is that investors already paid for the projected revenue growth in many SaaS stocks a full 2 years earlier.\nLet\u2019s look at historical multiples of Enterprise Value / Forward Revenue for the past decade. As you can see below, enterprise software multiples have largely held steady at 3-4x forward revenue. However, SaaS multiples began diverging in 2012 from their historical range of 5-6x forward revenue. This divergence peaked at the end of 2013 and has remained elevated above historical averages for 2 more years.\nThe Black Friday correction brought SaaS multiples back in-line with enterprise software valuations. Like many corrections, the market has overshot to the downside as we at Emergence believe long term SaaS valuations of 5-6x forward revenue will return.\nNote: Enterprise Software = Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. SaaS = Athenahealth, Castlight, Concur, Cornerstone, Dealertrak, FireEye, Marketo, Netsuite, Realpage, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Splunk, Tableau, Veeva and Workday.\nGrowth Cannot Outrun Multiple Compression\nRecurring revenue business models are highly valued for recurring revenue and predictable growth engines. But what happens when predictable growth is no longer valued at predictable multiples? In the chart below, you can see what has happened to 4 of the hottest IPOs of the last few years. Workday has grown revenue from $470MM to over $1.1B in 2 years and yet their market value is down 40%. Marketo has doubled revenue over the last 2 years and their market value is down 60%. This is a really painful lesson for shareholders \u2013 it does not matter how fast revenue is growing if multiples are compressing faster.\nThere are number of factors that drive valuation multiples: future growth rates, operating margin and addressable market to name a few. For most of the public SaaS companies, the two main drivers of multiple compression have been decreasing revenue growth rates and diminishing risk appetite of investors.\nLessons for SaaS Entrepreneurs\nSo what does all of this mean for SaaS entrepreneurs? To be blunt, the issue of multiple compression is an even bigger challenge for valuations of private companies. Unlike the public markets which have regular earnings that ignite valuation changes, the private markets have very few catalysts for change. Private valuations have been driven upward by an abundance of capital pushing valuations higher and higher. You can see evidence of this trend in the scatterplot below of private SaaS valuations from the last decade.\nNote: Early Growth = $2-5MM ARR. Growth = $5-20MM ARR. Pre-Public is $20MM+ ARR. I excluded certain outliers.\nSimilar to the public markets, SaaS valuation ranges began expanding in 2012. Unlike the public markets, private market valuations remained elevated through 2014. I purposefully truncated the data at the beginning of 2015 so as not to give away too much proprietary information. However, I will say that 2015 continued the trend until Q4 when fundraising became noticeably tighter \u2013 particularly in angel rounds and late stage rounds.\nThe direct impact of a contraction in multiples is only felt when entrepreneurs are fundraising and the end result for the market is more flat/down rounds and more situations where a startup has to drastically cut burn.\nHere is a scenario that I\u2019ve seen play out multiple times in the last 3 months. Hot SaaS startup raised a large Series A 12 months ago: $8-10MM at a $40MM post-money valuation. The company projected 2-300% growth on a base of $1MM ARR. Because they raised a large A, they accelerated hiring to hit aggressive growth targets and they are now burning $600K/month.\nNow, that same SaaS startup is at $4MM ARR and they want to raise $20MM and they expect a valuation of $100MM. Only now, multiples have compressed to 10x ARR. The entrepreneur does not like the dilution of $20MM in a flat round so there is a hard decision to make: raise less and drastically cut burn or raise what you need and suffer dilution. This situation can become a vicious cycle as sustaining growth is critical for future fundraising.\nThis scenario oversimplifies the fundraising process and certainly every situation is different. However, the point I want to make is simple. The best entrepreneurs and best companies will be just fine fundraising even with a tightening market.\nIt\u2019s the startups with challenging cap tables, cost structures or market timing issues that will really struggle to fundraise.\nBlack Friday isn\u2019t the canary in the coal mine \u2013 it should be the last wake up call for SaaS entrepreneurs to take a good look at their business and make absolutely certain that they have a contingency plan for 18 months of cash.\nP.S. If you want to preserve cash without cutting costs, here are 5 cash flow hacks for SaaS startups.\n}}
{{Police in New Jersey are trying to track down a gunman who opened fire inside The Mills at Jersey Gardens mall on Black Friday. Wale Aliyu reports.\nA man was shot during Black Friday shopping at a New Jersey mall, sending terrified shoppers running and hiding in stores.\nThe man was shot in the wrist Friday night at The Mills at Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, city spokeswoman Kelly Martins said. She said his injuries didn't appear life-threatening.\nNo suspect was in custody, and the victim was not cooperating with police, Martins said. Police were reviewing camera footage.\nThe mall was evacuated after the shooting, which happened in a hallway between a Tommy Hilfiger and a Marshalls store, Martins said.\nCarli Disla, her boyfriend, and their 6-week-old daughter were in a Cohoes fashion store heading to the cash registers when the couple noticed people running.\n\"They were yelling, 'Hide, everyone, hide! They are shooting!'\" Disla, 22, told The Associated Press in an interview via Twitter.\nShe and her boyfriend grabbed the newborn out of her car seat, ran to the back of the store and hid in its receiving area. The store's security gates were pulled down and the exits locked until police and state troopers told shoppers and staffers they couldn't leave until everything was under control, Disla said. They were allowed to leave around 9 p.m.\n\"It was a horrible experience and very traumatizing,\" Disla said. But fortunately, the baby didn't pick up on the fright \u2014 she slept through the whole experience.\nJeanette Bermudez told WPIX-TV she was working as a manager in a store when she suddenly heard people running so intensely they sounded like they were stomping.

Officers found one man stabbed in the abdomen and another man wounded elsewhere on his body. Both are in their 20s and were taken to a hospital, police said.\nThe mall's management said in a statement that the bloodshed was an \"isolated incident\" and \"absolutely unacceptable.\" The management said it \"strengthens our resolve to remain vigilant.\"\n}}

{{Scheme is run by Just A Card, inspired by distressed shop owner\u2019s tale in the Guardian\nThe tale of a distressed shopkeeper in the What I\u2019m Really Thinking column in the Guardian has mushroomed into a nationwide initiative helping 10,000 independent retailers fight for survival.\nThe Just A Card campaign was started by London-based artist Sarah Hamilton three years ago after she read a mournful first person account of the owner of an arts and crafts shop facing closure.\nIn it, the struggling shopkeeper wrote: \u201cWe will be shutting up shop soon. We can\u2019t go on. Our little business has been a success in every way except one \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make money. I\u2019ve never got down on my knees and begged them to buy a card before they go, but I think about it.\u201d\nInspired by the story, Hamilton launched Just A Card to encourage people to buy from independent galleries and shops by reinforcing the message that all purchases, however small, even \u201cjust a card\u201d, are vital to the prosperity and survival of small businesses.\nThe Just A Card campaign.\nThe scheme is gathering momentum, with nearly 50,000 followers on social media and stickers, featuring its distinctive bird logo, in an estimated 10,000 shop windows. From Monday, it is running an \u201cindie week\u201d to counter the might of Black Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing something about what we see as a really big problem,\u201d says Hamilton, adding that the volunteer-run campaign came about as she noticed fellow artists and the stores where they sold their work were struggling. \u201cThe Just A Card sticker in a window is a call to arms. We want to remind everyone that shopping small is a must this Christmas.\u201d\nRecent figures chart the stark decline of Britain\u2019s high streets with the number of vacant shops, pubs and restaurants increasing by more than 4,400 in the first six months of 2008. As fewer Britons visit the high street shops, galleries and pubs are suffering in a climate of rising costs and falling sales.\nHamilton says the bird references a red cross and the idea of friendship and mutual support. \u201cRunning a shop is often a labour of love,\u201d she adds. \u201cWithout dedication and passion, and crucially sales, it would be another boarded up eyesore.\u201d\nThe recent budget included a \u00a31.5bn package to help struggling high streets, including business rates relief for independent shopkeepers and a \u00a3675m fund to back regeneration projects which will launch in 2019.\nVisa, which sponsored the recent Great British High Street Awards 2018, is running a Christmas ad for the first time featuring a cast of nine real shopkeepers to encourage Britons to use their local shops. \u201cThe festive season is critically important for shopkeepers nationwide,\u201d said Visa\u2019s Adrian Farina. \u201cWe are encouraging the nation to visit the high street this Christmas and celebrate the independent retailers that make them special.\u201d\n}}
{{In this Nov. 23, 2017, file photo, people wait in line for a Best Buy store to open for a Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving Day, in Overland Park, Kan.\nBlack Friday is the most famous shopping day of the year, with millions of bargain-hungry shoppers flocking to stores to cash in on dramatic sales.

As she told CNBC Make It in 2017, \"Black Friday is still very strong, but a lot of the big deals are going to go live on Thanksgiving Day.\" The holiday is, \"unfortunately, the better of the two days.\"\nSure enough, Dealnews recently reported that \"even though we posted the most deals on Black Friday itself in 2017, both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday featured more Editors' Choice deals.\"\nMore and more stores are even rolling out sales before Thanksgiving in an effort to get ahead of competitors, says Sakraida, who recommends checking for sales as early as the Monday before Thanksgiving.\nThe smartest time to shop also depends on what you're looking for.\nIn 2018, \"Black Friday will likely be the best day to get deals on kitchen goods, clothes, tools, beauty products, toys, laptops and appliances,\" Dealnews reports. \"But if you're looking for most types of electronics, Thanksgiving tends to have better deals. We're predicting Turkey Day will have the best deals on smartphones, speakers, tablets headphones and video games in 2018.\n\"And if you want to buy a television or book your next vacation? Cyber Monday is probably the best time to shop.\"\nIf you really want to maximize savings, you should continuously check for sales starting this week, as \"the best sales could pop up at any time,\" the sites notes.\nWhether you're shopping on the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday or Cyber Monday, you'll want to have a plan in place to avoid overspending.\nStart by determining exactly how much you can afford to part with. Once you have a budget in mind, do your research, says Sakraida: \"Definitely do historical price research to get a quick assessment of whether or not the prices you're seeing are actually good.\"\nShe recommends using camelcamelcamel, a free Amazon price tracker, or doing a Google search to get an idea of how different stores price various items.\nWhile you're at it, check out similar items or versions of whatever it is you're looking for, she says: \"If you're dead set on one specific model, you may be blind to the other discounts that exist on very similar alternatives. Keeping an open mind and being a little bit flexible with what you end up buying, within reason, is definitely a good tactic.\"\nFinally, avoid impulse purchases. One of the biggest mistakes consumers make over Black Friday weekend, says Sakraida, \"is buying things that they weren't planning on buying beforehand and that don't fit a specific need.\"\nIf you discover a discount on something that you were planning on buying, great, but resist the temptation to buy things just because they're on sale.\n\"The reason Black Friday exists is to bring you in with the really cheap, rock-bottom prices in the hopes that you do jump on those filler deals while you're there,\" says Sakraida. \"Being really aware of that and trying to avoid that temptation is important.\"\nCopyright CNBC\n}}

{{(CNN) \u2014 Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still shopping bonanzas for retailers.\nMastercard estimated sales on Black Friday hit $23 billion, surging 9% from last year. Cyber Monday sales are expected to climb to $7.9 billion, a 19% increase from last year, Adobe Analytics predicted.\nAlthough it will take several weeks for the dust to settle, traditional players have emerged as early winners in the holiday shake out. Traffic at Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), and Kohl\u2019s (KSS) was strong on Black Friday and into the weekend, analysts say.\nAmazon (AMZN) said US customers this year bought \u201cmillions more products\u201d from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, including toys like L.O.L. Surprise.\nThe early results signal that retailers got a lift from a strong economy, convenient new ways to spend, and the demise of former rivals. All five companies\u2019 stock prices rose on Monday, reflecting investor optimism for the holidays.\nAlthough fewer shoppers turned out at brick-and-mortar stores, more bought on online and on their smartphones.\nOverall, traffic to physical stores dipped 1% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared to 2017, according to ShopperTrak, a retail consultancy that monitors in-store traffic. Digital analytics firm RetailNext said traffic declined 6.6% during the four-day weekend compared to a year ago.\n\u201cThis was a great Black Friday. Consumers came out in droves and retailers stepped up efforts around inventory and servicing,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser at NPD Group.\nHoliday shopping still rules\nDespite fewer trips to the malls and more time for customers to score deals than ever before, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are critical to retailers. They make an outsized chunk of their sales during the final quarter of the year.\nRetailers that disappoint during the stretch can face harsh consequences from investors, especially those that sell holiday staples like toys, electronics, and jewelry.\n\u201cA weak performance during the end-of-year shopping season puts a retailer in a fragile position,\u201d Euromonitor International analyst Amanda Bourlier said in a research report earlier this month.\nSeveral factors have underpinned growth this year, starting with the economy and consumers flush with more cash to spend.\nWages, which grew 3.1% in October compared with a year ago, are inching up after years of stagnant growth. Unemployment is at a 49-year low and consumer confidence is at an 18-year high.\n\u201cWe continue to benefit from a very healthy consumer and macroeconomic backdrop,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts last week.\nEfforts to expand online pickup at stores and delivery options have paid off with shoppers. Online order pickups rose 73% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared with last year, according to Adobe.\nAnd a drop in gas prices is also helping consumers, giving them more to spend more on holiday gifts.\nSeizing the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us opportunity\nThe collapse of Sears, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and Bon-Ton is boosting the rest of the pack.\nMore than 5,460 stores have closed so far this year, including 881 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019, 472 Sears and Kmart\u2019s, and 260 Bon-Ton department stores, according to retail think-tank Coresight Research.\nWalmart and Target have raced to fill the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us vacancy. They have stockpiled inventory, expanded sections at stores, and built up their online offering. L.O.L. Surprise and Fingerlings have been among the best selling toys, analysts say.\nToy sections were busy at both companies during the weekend, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman said in a report on Monday.

{{Black Friday\nAccording to Snopes.com, the term \u2018Black Friday\u2019 did not originate with the practice of selling off slaves on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\u201cBlack Friday\u201d is the (originally derisive, now mainstream) term for the phenomenon that takes place in the U.S. on the day after Thanksgiving Thursday, when millions of consumers who get the day off from work or school crowd into stores for what is traditionally considered the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. The origins of the term \u201cBlack Friday\u201d have become somewhat obscured in the mists of time, however, leading people to invent fanciful explanations for how that phrase became attached to the day after Thanksgiving. The example reproduced above posits the term started with a tradition of slaveowners or slave traders using that day as an opportunity for selling their wares.\nThe use of \u201cBlack Friday\u201d as a descriptor for the day after Thanksgiving has nothing to do with the selling of slaves, though, and the term didn\u2019t originate until nearly a century after the practice of slavery was abolished in the U.S. The earliest known use of \u201cBlack Friday\u201d in such a context stems from 1951 and referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving in order to have four consecutive days off (because that day was not yet commonly offered as a paid day off by employers):\nAbout Snopes.com\nThe Snopes.com web site was founded by David Mikkelson, a project begun in 1994 as an expression of his interest in researching urban legends that has since grown into the oldest and largest fact-checking site on the Internet, one widely regarded by journalists, folklorists, and laypersons alike as one of the world\u2019s essential resources.

{{To the Black Friday victors go the spoils.\nUse these hacks to guarantee yourself the deals you want, whether you decide to shop from your couch or at the store.\nOnline shopping\nThink outside the box. Some stores are synonymous with Black Friday: Target, Walmart and Best Buy, to name a few. But don\u2019t limit yourself, especially if inventory is selling out quickly at these mass merchants.\n\u201cAlmost everybody offers something,\u201d says Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research, a business advisory firm. She recommends seeking out less mainstream sites, such as Newegg for electronics.\nGo incognito. When it\u2019s time to buy on Black Friday, open an incognito window to enable private browsing and disable plugins, says Mike Catania, chief technology officer of coupon website PromotionCode.org. If you don\u2019t, he says some websites can track your previous visits or coupon plug-ins and adjust their prices accordingly.\nWhen in doubt, compare prices across a few different browsers. You can also log in to your online account at the retailer, if you have one, to look for member-specific offers.\nScour social media. Follow retailers on Twitter and like them on Facebook for sale news in your social feed. Stores such as Target and Home Depot also have Black Friday pages on their websites where customers can sign up to receive deal alerts.\nCheck your inbox frequently on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday. Retailers sometimes offer deals for a few hours or less, says Jackie Breyer, editor-in-chief of toy review website The Toy Insider.\nThere will be countless sales, so make just three or four stores your top priority, says Michael Parrish DuDell, chief strategy officer of coupon website CouponFollow. He suggests going \u201call in\u201d at retailers with a history of Black Friday discounts in hope of being rewarded with exclusive offers. Subscribe to their newsletters, download their apps and join their loyalty programs.\nSeek out free shipping. \u201cI think a lot of Black Friday activity will be online this year,\u201d Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \u201cSurveys are showing that shoppers are still very price sensitive and free shipping is important.\u201d\nFind retailers that offer free shipping with no minimum or a very low minimum. Best Buy, for instance, has announced free shipping with no minimum on eligible orders through Dec. 25.\nIf you can\u2019t find free shipping, there\u2019s another option. \u201cWhen you can, get your online order sent to the store instead of your home to save money on shipping costs,\u201d Jon Lal, CEO of cash-back website BeFrugal, said in an email. \u201cSome large retail stores have a convenient desk at the front of the store and a pickup area to park so you\u2019ll be in and out quickly.\u201d\nIn-store shopping\nLean on retailers. The best way to win Black Friday is to plan ahead and use retailer resources. Last year, Target released a map online that detailed where specific deals would be located in the store.\nStores including Best Buy and Walmart post Black Friday shopping tips on their websites. Best Buy , for example, advises, \u201cCheck out the Best Buy preview ad in advance, and even visit your local store, scoping things out a few days ahead of time, so you know where the electronics deals you want are located.\u201d\nKeep your phone handy. Make sure your phone has a full charge before leaving for the store, Lal says. You can use it to compare prices and load scannable coupons.\nYou\u2019ll also want to download a few discount apps. They can save you from clipping coupons or furiously combing through pages of ads.\nSlice is an app that compiles sales. Open it on Black Friday, tap the \u201cdeals\u201d tab and browse available promotions. And Thinkover lets you save items you want to buy ahead of Black Friday. If something you\u2019ve been eyeing goes on sale, you\u2019ll receive an alert.\nYou could also get rewarded for shopping. With the Shopkick app, users earn points, or \u201ckicks,\u201d for walking into stores, scanning barcodes and making purchases. Points can eventually be redeemed for digital gift cards. Drop is another app that rewards users with points \u2014 and eventually gift cards \u2014 for everyday spending.\nAll shopping\nRequest an additional discount. It never hurts to ask, according to Mark Ellwood, author of \u201cBargain Fever: How to Shop in a Discounted World.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re shopping online, Ellwood advises contacting the customer service department a few days before Black Friday to see if it can sweeten the deal. There are \u201ctoo many shops and not enough shoppers,\u201d he says, so representatives might be willing to work with you rather than lose you to a competitor.\nEarn credit card cash back. Match your method of payment with the store where you shop. Some credit cards are offering generous cash-back percentages at certain stores this holiday season. That could pay off, especially if you\u2019re already going to be shopping at one of those stores.

{{Legislatures, state and federal, are starting to react to the trend of employers \u2014 at least the creepy employers \u2014 requiring job applicants and employees to turn over usernames and passwords for personal social media accounts.\nHere\u2019s a post from the Goodwin Procter law firm about a new law passed in Maryland and one in the works in Illinois. The point of such legislation is to make it illegal for employers to coerce job applicants and employees to surrender their autonomy in this manner. Federal legislation on the subject has also been introduced.\nLawmakers face a huge challenge, however, in trying to ensure such laws don\u2019t compromise an employer\u2019s legitimate interest in its own business information. Productivity applications are quickly being \u201cconsumerized,\u201d the iPhone is now enterprise-issued hardware, and cloud storage and web services are often used by most of us for both business and non-business. In today\u2019s mobile environment, for many, there is no bright line between \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cnon-personal\u201d digital behavior.\nUnfortunately, the Maryland law relies on just such an anachronistic \u201cpersonal / non-personal\u201d distinction.\nThe Maryland law says an employer can\u2019t require that the applicant or employee supply her password to access \u201ca personal account or service through an electronic communications device.\u201d Balancing that with allowance for employer access to business information, the Maryland law states it\u2019s OK to require an employee to produce a password to access \u201cnonpersonal accounts or services that provide access to the employer\u2019s internal computer or information systems.\u201d\nGood luck, Marylanders, dividing the email accounts and apps on your tablet computers into \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cnon-personal\u201d categories!\nThe Goodwin Proctor post says another initiative, one in Illinois, is about to take effect. This legislation betters Maryland\u2019s effort. It provides:\n\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any employer to request or require any employee or prospective employee to provide any password or other related account information in order to gain access to the employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s account or profile on a social networking website or to demand access in any manner to an employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s account or profile on a social networking website.\u201d\nThis legislation makes distinctions between social media and other kinds of web services. Here\u2019s how \u201ca social networking website\u201d is defined in the Illinois bill:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this subsection, \u2018social networking website\u2019 means an Internet-based service that allows individuals to: (A) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, created by the service; (B) create a list of other users with whom they share a connection within the system; and (C) view and navigate their list of connections and those made by others within the system.\u201d\nIs the definition perfect? No. For instance, while I think it captures Facebook and Twitter, at least as those two services work today, I\u2019m not sure it captures Google+. Something fun to try: think of your favorite cloud storage service, and ask yourself, would it satisfy all elements of the Illinois test, and thus be deemed a \u201csocial networking website?\u201d\nEmail is trickier. Illinois says that a social networking website \u201cshall not include electronic mail.\u201d There may be other laws in Illinois on the books about email, but the exception here in this legislation suggests Illinois is wary about treading into business information territory.\n}}

{{Facebook is hosting a webcast for press tomorrow about \"upcoming privacy changes\" to the site: the announcement will likely outline Facebook's transition toward becoming more public - some might say more Twitter-like.\nWe already know change is on the way: last week Facebook announced that they're beta testing a publishing feature (with a limited number of profiles) by which your Facebook status updates can optionally be made public. In short: you'll be able to use Facebook just like Twitter, and broadcast public updates to the world.\nWe also wrote about another interesting find last week: a new setting in Facebook that lets you receive an email when someone becomes a \"fan\" of your Facebook profile - not a friend, but actually someone who follows your personal Facebook page without you reciprocating. And a new Facebook Search is in testing too, allowing you to search updates from friends or all public publishers.\nFacebook, then, is moving to a model of public updates and Twitter-like followers. The question becomes: can Facebook, which built its brand on \"real names\" and true friendships, also become the leader in public sharing and updates?\nThe MySpace Era\nThe tactic is certainly in contrast to Facebook's early years: the network went beyond MySpace and its various clones by emphasizing real relationships and extreme privacy.\nYour Facebook profile was a representation of your real-life social graph, and when users tired of amassing thousands of fake MySpace friends and adding \"bling\" to their profiles, they flocked to Facebook's cleaner, more controlled environment with a smaller number of high-value relationships.\nFacebook even limited networks of friends to 5000 people to prevent this high-volume friend adding, which threatened to devalue the meaning of a Facebook friend. The strategy served them well; MySpace became a ghost town.\nThen Twitter happened...\n...and suddenly the press was in love with openness again, with our newfound ability to mine the public consciousness through Twitter search, with a new era in which there was more value to be had in sharing information than in keeping it private.\nFacebook's gated community was a lot less useful when penning a news story about the Iranian elections, or the Hudson Plane Crash, or the public reaction to Michael Jackson's death. Less useful, too, for conscientious brands looking for customer feedback. And less valuable for finding a new, spontaneous connection with that random Twitter user who happens to discuss the same topics as you.\nTwitter's public updates - and more specifically, the mining of these updates through Twitter Search - provided a more complete database of the public consciousness than ever before, a source of untold insights.\nSo what do you do when you're all about privacy, and your upstart competitor is doing the complete opposite? By making a complete about-face, Facebook would lose the faith of its 200 million+ users who value the privacy of the site most of all: it's what the core userbase was sold on from the start.\nSo Facebook is trying to find a middle road whereby privacy is maintained and public sharing is an optional extra. Over time, they surely hope, the number of Facebook \"public\" users will exceed the total number of Twitter users. At that point, Facebook would be a more valuable resource; it would become the larger hivemind.\nWho will win the race is anybody's guess: Twitter has a singular focus and the right DNA. It has a culture of public sharing that was present from the start. Facebook has scale on its side, and would only need to convert some of its users to public sharing to maintain its lead.\nIt's a race that will define social networking for months and possibly years to come. And tomorrow Facebook will likely twannounce its next step.\n}}
{{When Chris Hughes bought majority ownership of the New Republic in 2012, there was some hope that the Facebook cofounder would be the kind of benefactor who would bring the magazine into the 21st century while retaining its place as a leading liberal voice.\nLess than four years later, the magazine is a shadow of its former self \u2014 and Hughes is waving the white flag.\nThe magazine is now up for sale, according to a report on Monday, and is already in talks with a variety of suitors.\nHughes admitted that he had \"underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today\u2019s quickly evolving climate.\"\n\"There are bright signs on the horizon: Vox, Vice, the Texas Tribune, Buzzfeed, ProPublica, and Mic embody a new generation of promising organizations \u2014 some for-profit, others non-profit \u2014 that have put serious, high-quality journalism at the core of their identities,\" he wrote in a letter to the magazine's staff. \"The New York Times, The Atlantic, and other traditional outlets seem to have found business models that work for them. I hope that this institution will one day be part of that list. To get there The New Republic needs a new vision that only a new owner can bring.\"\nNews that Hughes is exploring a sale, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes amid continued struggles to adapt the publication's business and editorial operations to a more digital focus.\nHughes had worked to rejuvenate the magazine, unveiling the \"New New Republic\" in January 2013 after naming himself editor-in-chief and publisher.\nHis efforts did not sit well with some at the magazine, culminating in a mass exodus of its most talented journalists.\nIn early December 2014, editor Franklin Foer, literary editor Leon Wieseltier and a variety of senior editors and contributing editors resigned en mass.\nBREAKING: Mass resignations just submitted at @TNR Full list\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SdM0VPQ8Et \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) December 5, 2014\nHughes acknowledged this as part of his legacy at TNR, but said that he believed it would not mark the beginning of the end for the magazine.\n\"Our disagreement didn\u2019t help our ability to make The New Republic viable today, but it also did not spell our demise,\" he wrote.\n}}
{{I recently got a prompt from Facebook to take a short survey on my user experience. You might've gotten one, too. It's pretty quick and painless \u2014 the company gives you a multiple-choice form and starts by asking how happy you are with Facebook, whether the service is easy to use, and if it's reliable or not.\nBut then Facebook asks you something really interesting. It asks whether you trust it.\nWhat that means isn't exactly clear. Trust Facebook to do what? To be a reliable catalog of your life? To keep your data out of the hands of the NSA? To show you only the Farmville updates you care about?\nThe ambiguity isn't much of a surprise. It's a perfect reflection of the broader Silicon Valley philosophy about data: Explicit definitions are unnecessary if you have enough respondents to form an average understanding of what \"trustworthy\" implies. Let people answer according to their own interpretation of the word, and the aggregate results from the whole userbase should be sufficiently revealing.\nRather more enlightening is the fact that Facebook cared to ask at all. Someone there is at least curious about the answers, if not actively worried about it. And there's good reason for that: In polling by third parties, Facebook hasn't fared too well on the question of trust.\nNearly 60 percent of respondents to an AP/CNBC survey last year said they had \"little or no faith\" in Facebook's commitment to privacy. Active users of Facebook were in fact more likely to say so than non-users of the service.\nThen, this year, Reason ran a poll in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations about U.S. surveillance. The results were remarkable. Seventy-five percent of respondents said they trusted Facebook only a little bit or not at all to protect privacy. By contrast, the share of people saying the same about the NSA came to just 59 percent. More people, in other words, were distrustful of Facebook than the NSA \u2014 even in the weeks following massive unauthorized disclosures about the agency's controversial snooping activity.\nIf Facebook performs so dismally on third-party surveys, what does its own userbase tell the company? When I asked Facebook what insights it had learned from the questionnaire, a spokesman told me the company does not share the data it collects from the survey \u2014 even though it asks regularly for data from us.\n\"We are constantly working to improve our service,\" the spokesperson said, \"and getting regular feedback from the people who use it is an invaluable part of the process.\"\nFacebook might actually gain by releasing its results, whatever they happen to look like. Suppose the numbers turn out looking really bad. With solid majorities of Americans already skeptical of Facebook's privacy practices, it's not like the company's score on that count could get much worse. And clearly people continue to use Facebook anyway, as the AP/CNBC results show.\n}}

{{The caption is brief: \u201cThis is Iran\u2026 The feeling of the wind blowing through every strand of hair, is a girl\u2019s biggest dream.\u201d\nA woman stands in a green valley, staring at a far-off mountain vista. Her arms are covered and her face obscured. Her honey-blond hair is the only clue to her identity.\nThis is one of thousands of photos posted to Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women, a Facebook page dedicated to \u201cIranian women inside the country who want to share their \u201cstealthily\u201d taken photos without the veil.\u201d\nWithin the first two days of its creation, 30,000 women posted photos of themselves. Two weeks later, the page netted more than 200,000 likes.\n\u201cThere is a phrase called guilty pleasures in English, you know, like having a fondness for chocolate when you know it\u2019s not good for you,\u201d says journalist and creator Masih Alinejad. \u201cFor me, when I was in Iran, taking my veil off, was like thumbing my nose at authority, especially the authority that was forced upon me.\u201d\nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, come summer Iranian women face heightened scrutiny from the \u201cmorality police.\u201d\n\u201cFor a few weeks at the beginning of warm weather season\u2014when sandals and capri pants and colorful linen tunics replace drab winter coats and boots\u2013Iran\u2019s morality police raid the streets punishing women for daring to show their painted toes, bare ankles and streaks of highlight,\u201d writes WSJ reporter Farnaz Fassihi.\nMounire Charrad, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas-Austin and Middle Eastern women\u2019s studies specialist, says she was most struck by three things in the images posted on \u201cStealthy Freedoms\u201d: the multiple generations of women represented, the supportive comments posted by men and the photos depicting couples or mentioning husbands.\n\u201cWomen in different places have found ways of expressing their own power in ways that don\u2019t cross to the other side,\u201d she says. \u201cBut certainly 100,000 people, with support from men and mothers \u2013 it means women are responding to this.\u201d\nAnd higher-profile posters, such as human rights lawyer Nasrin Soutoudeh, are also joining the group. When Soutoudeh posted a photo of herself \u2013 head uncovered \u2013 to the page on May 15, the picture and her accompanying message was shared more than 1,000 times within just 24 hours.\n\u201cThe term \u2018Stealthy Freedom\u2019 is indicative of the pressures that exists within Iran,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen thousands of women defy the hijab laws on social media, we cannot deny the existence of pressures for change.\u201d\nAlthough women expose their faces on the page, sometimes only obscured by sunglasses or a camera angle, Alinejad keeps the names of all the posters anonymous.\n\u201cThese women are extremely brave because they have posted their photographs on Facebook, which is banned under the law in Iran,\u201d Alinejad says. \u201cThey are in a way daring the authorities to arrest them. And with the publicity that the site has received, the pictures of these women are all over the world.\u201d\nIn another photo, a woman dips her toes in the ocean, her hair gathered in a thick black ponytail: \u201cI am an Iranian woman; and I know my men\u2019s eyes cannot bear to see my freedom! I don\u2019t want this freedom so that I can show off my beauty. I just want to have it so that my hair can breathe! \u2026 Dear Masih, I\u2019d like to thank you for your efforts to help me and many other women like me to be heard.\u201d\nAs Charrad points out, displaying an uncovered head on Facebook is not as defiant as walking freely on a sidewalk in Tehran. But it\u2019s an important step, and one that more and more women are taking.\nIn one photo dated May 15, a woman is running in an open field, a colorful scarf streaming behind her. She\u2019s a distant figure; the vastness of the valley and the vivid blue of the sky almost hide her completely.\n\u201cMy dear Masih,\u201d she writes, \u201cI love this photo dearly. I took it a month ago in Shiraz near Sheshpir River. It was a sunny day and my husband said \u2018Don\u2019t you really feel hot? Be comfortable..!\u2019 So I removed my scarf from my head and started running in the plain.. I enjoyed the wind blowing through my hair so much that the sound of my laughter filled the whole plain.\u201d\n}}
{{Bolt \u2014 the rumored photo messaging app Facebook accidentally leaked \u2014 has't even been released, yet it's already facing potential legal threats over its name.\nLast week, some Instagram users reported seeing in-app ads for a photo messaging app dubbed \"Bolt.\" Rumor has it that Bolt will be Instagram's version of Snapchat and the app could drop as early as this week.\nSee also: 11 Creepiest Things You Can Do on Instagram\nBolt would join Instagram Messenger, Slingshot and WhatsApp as a Facebook-owned photo messaging solution. But beyond standing out in a crowded space (in the same company no less), Bolt's biggest problems might come down to its name.\nIt turns out, there is already a mobile communications app called Bolt. And that Bolt, isn't happy about the prospect of a Facebook-owned app sharing the same name.\nAlthough Bolt isn't a photo messaging app \u2014 its goal is to replace your phone carrier's voice and SMS plan \u2014 it is understandably concerned about another messaging app sharing its name.\nBenton told TechCrunch that it already filed a trademark application for the name \"Bolt\" as it relates to mobile messaging. That application is still pending.\nOn its company blog, co-founder and CEO Andrew Benton urging Instagram (and Facebook) to use another name so that the two parties can avoid legal nastiness.\n\"Technically,\" Benton writes, \"we have to 'police our mark,' otherwise we risk losing it.\"\n\"We've worked really hard since then building the Bolt brand and technology to where it is today. Please don't destroy all that effort.\"\nApp name dust-ups\nBolt is just the latest in a growing number of app name collisions. It's not uncommon for different companies to come up with similar ideas \u2014 and similar names \u2014 for products and services.\nIn February, FiftyThree, maker of the iPad illustration app Paper, publicly asked Facebook to change the name of its news reader, Paper. Facebook apologized for the confusion, but declined to change the name of its app.\nIn May, the original owner of the domain Swarmapp.com, expressed outrage on Medium after Foursquare bought the domain from him to launch its own Swarm app, which had a similar motif.\nName collisions aren't limited to just apps; Cisco acquired the trademark to the name \"iPhone\" in 2000, seven years before Apple announced its first smartphone. Apple and Cisco resolved the dispute over the name before the iPhone was released in June 2007.\nThe more common the word, the more contentious trademarks over that word can be. Google is currently trying to trademark Glass under the context of wearable computing, but its facing blowback from the USPTO.\nApple in 2011 failed in its attempt at trademarking \"app store.\"\nThese types of collisions are increasingly difficult to navigate when it comes to digital objects, because trademarks can be granted for seemingly similar, yet different enough, purposes.\nWith generic words such as \"paper,\" \"swarm\" and \"bolt,\" securing a trademark that is enforceable could be difficult or impossible \u2014 especially if the opposing side has the backing of a large entity such as Facebook.\nFor its part, Bolt hopes Facebook and Instagram will consider rebranding the app before its release.\n}}
{{GameHouse is placing a bigger bet on casino-style social gaming starting today\u2014 moving beyond its existing Facebook slots game to launch a larger casino on the social network, with more than a dozen games. GameHouse also is expanding its original slots game to iPhone and iPad with the release of a new iOS app.\nIt\u2019s part of an effort by GameHouse to reshape the category of social casino games, in which gamers can buy credits but can\u2019t win real money. GameHouse is promising expanded social experiences including a \u201cParty Play\u201d feature and the ability to see which games friends have recently played.\n\u201cWe see the social casino space as a big opportunity for the company since this category of gameplay is so popular on every platform,\u201d said Matt Hulett, GameHouse president, in a news releasing announcing the GameHouse Casino. \u201cVegas-style gaming is a real interest for millions of people around the world and we\u2019re excited to be building an experience for consumers across all of their devices, anytime everywhere.\u201d\nGameHouse, the video-game division of RealNetworks, brings a more polished look and feel to its casino than many of the existing competitors in the market, but its Facebook casino is also a relatively late arrival on the scene.\nSeattle\u2019s DoubleDown Interactive, an early entrant in the space, was acquired last year by gambling giant IGT for up to $500 million, and has experienced steady growth thanks in part to gaining traction before Facebook started making it more difficult to attract new users without paying a premium for promotions on the social network.\nThe RealNetworks Games division posted $67.1 million in revenue in 2012, a 31 percent decrease from the year before.

{{Many of us pay a monthly or annual fee for Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime and other online services. So why not pay for Facebook?\nThe concept is resurfacing amid the scandal over the misuse of data from more than 50 million Facebook users by the Cambridge Analytica research firm.\nIt\u2019s worth a serious look, says Ryan Calo, associate professor at the University of Washington School of Law and co-director of the UW\u2019s Tech Policy Lab, who has floated the idea of a premium Facebook option in the past. Making money from users, rather than from advertisers, could reduce or eliminate the temptation for the social network to push the envelope by oversharing user data for purposes of targeted marketing.\nUltimately, the challenge is that Facebook\u2019s current business model is built on monetizing personal information.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you can reconcile that business model with truly putting the consumer and the consumer\u2019s privacy and autonomy in front,\u201d said Calo in an interview with GeekWire this morning.\nCalo has argued in the past that Facebook should experiment with a paid option, such as $1/month, but said he has gotten pushback from people who cite the potential to expose financial data or exacerbate the digital divide by excluding users who couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the service.\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my basic point is that ultimately something needs to change structurally as to the incentives of these firms, or this tension is going to play out indefinitely.\u201d\nAn analysis this week by Chris Wilson, director of data journalism for Time.com, concluded that an average subscription price of $75/year per user could allow Facebook to cover operating costs and generate \u201ca healthy profit.\u201d\nAlternatively, do Facebook\u2019s current problems create an opening for another company to challenge the social networking giant with a competing paid service? Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users, which would make that a Herculean task. And that\u2019s only one of the challenges.\n\u201cThere are a number of impediments to competing with Facebook, not the least of which is that Facebook will buy competitors,\u201d Calo said, citing the irony of WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton supporting the \u2018DeleteFacebook\u2019 campaign after selling the messaging platform to Facebook for $22 billion in 2014.\nUltimately, Calo said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that Facebook is bad \u2026 but rather that perhaps we were too hasty to completely mediate all of our interactions with each other. Maybe the wave of, \u2018Let\u2019s digitize every aspect our live; let\u2019s make sure we communicate only through an intermediary,\u2019 perhaps that wave is receding. And Facebook is bearing the brunt of it because, of course, Facebook is at the heart of it.\u201d\nListen for our full conversation with Calo on the next episode of GeekWire\u2019s Week in Geek podcast.\n}}
{{What if you could peek behind what\u2019s in your photos, like you\u2019re moving your head to see what\u2019s inside a window? That\u2019s the futuristic promise of Facebook 3D photos. After announcing the feature at F8 in May, Facebook is now rolling out 3D photos to add make-believe depth to your iPhone portrait mode shots. Shoot one, tap the new 3D photos option in the status update composer, select a portrait mode photo and users on the desktop or mobile News Feed as well as in VR through Oculus Go\u2019s browser or Firefox on Oculus Rift can tap/click and drag or move their head to see the photo\u2019s depth. Everyone can now view 3D photos and the ability to create them will open to everyone in the coming weeks.\nFacebook is constantly in search of ways to keep the News Feed interesting. What started with text and photos eventually expanded into videos and live broadcasts, and now to 360 photos and 3D photos. Facebook hopes if it\u2019s the exclusive social media home for these new kinds of content, you\u2019ll come back to explore and rack up some ad views in the meantime. Sometimes that means embracing mind-bending new formats like VR memories that recreate a scene in digital pointillism based on a photo.\nSo how exactly do 3D photos work? Our writer Devin Coldewey did a deep-dive earlier this year into how Facebook uses AI to stitch together real layers of the photo with what it infers should be there if you tilted your perspective. Since portrait mode fires off both of a phone\u2019s cameras simultaneously, parallax differences can be used to recreate what\u2019s behind the subject.\nTo create the best 3D photos with your iPhone 7+, 8+, X or XS (more phones will work with the feature in the future), Facebook recommends you keep your subject three to four feet away, and have things in the foreground and background. Distinct colors will make the layers separate better, and transparent or shiny objects like glass or plastic can throw off the AI.\nOriginally, the idea was to democratize the creation of VR content. But with headset penetration still relatively low, it\u2019s the ability to display depth in the News Feed that will have the greatest impact for Facebook. In an era where Facebook\u2019s cool is waning, hosting next-generation art forms could make it a must-visit property even as more of our socializing moves to Instagram.\n}}
{{Less than two months after agreeing to pay about $1 billion for San Francisco photo-sharing app Instagram, Facebook introduced its own, similar app for Apple (AAPL) mobile devices Thursday.\nFacebook began offering Facebook Camera as a free app for iOS devices. The software offers similar features as Instagram, including several filters that change the appearance of photos and the ability to share pictures with friends separate from Facebook\u2019s main ecosystem.\nFacebook agreed to acquire Instagram on April 9 for cash and stock then valued at $1 billion, but the value of the stock has widely varied after the Menlo Park social network went public last week and has experienced volatility on Wall Street. The deal has not closed, and Facebook recently changed wording in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings that indicated it did not expect the acquisition to be complete in the current quarter. If the deal does not go through, Facebook will owe Instagram $200 million, according to the companies\u2019 agreement.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that Instagram would continue to function as a separate entity after the acquisition goes through, so the introduction of Facebook photos would create a competitor from Facebook\u2019s side.\nInstagram launched just two years ago, but quickly found fans on iOS devices. It launched its Android app just a week before the Facebook deal and instantly increased its user base by 30 percent, according to reports. Facebook did not mention an Android version of Facebook Camera in its blog post announcing the new app.\nFacebook Camera is not the first independent app the world\u2019s most popular social network has introduced. The company also offers Facebook Messages for mobile devices, allowing users to communicate with friends without entering Facebook\u2019s main mobile app.\nFacebook has struggled to find a stable stock price since exercising a record-breaking initial public offering last week. After large descents Monday and Tuesday that took the company\u2019s share price 18.4 percent lower than the IPO price of $38, shares rose for the second consecutive day Thursday closing at $33.03, up $1.03 or 3.2 percent for the day.\nContact Jeremy C.

{{Rules appear to target services like Onavo Protect, which claims to protect user data even as it feeds information to Facebook\nApple has updated its rules to restrict app developers\u2019 ability to harvest data from mobile phones, which could be bad news for a Facebook-owned data security app called Onavo Protect.\nOnavo ostensibly provides users with a free virtual private network (VPN) which, it claims, helps \u201ckeep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web\u201d. What is not immediately obvious is that it feeds information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them back to the social networking giant.\n\u201cThe problem with Onavo is that it talks about being a VPN that keeps your data private, but behind the scenes it\u2019s harvesting your data for Facebook,\u201d said Ryan Dochuk, CEO of the paid-for VPN TunnelBear. \u201cIt goes against what people generally expect when they use a VPN.\u201d\nOnavo has been a Trojan horse for Facebook (in the classical sense, not as malware), allowing it to gather intelligence on the apps people use on tens of millions of devices outside its empire. This real-time market research highlights which apps are becoming popular and which are struggling. Such competitive intelligence can inform acquisition targets and negotiations as well as identify popular features it could copy in rival apps.\nAs first reported by Bloomberg, Apple\u2019s new App Store rules explicitly ban the collection of \u201cinformation about which other apps are installed on a user\u2019s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing\u201d, which appears to be intentionally worded to clamp down on apps like Onavo.\nThe lesson from big tech\u2019s latest PR events? They know we\u2019re on to them\u2026 | John Naughton Read more\n\u201cApple has been very clear that it\u2019s pro-privacy,\u201d ,\u201d said Joseph Jerome, a privacy specialist from the Center for Democracy and Technology, \u201cand with every iteration of iOS [Apple\u2019s mobile operating system] has been trying to restrain the ability of apps to know what\u2019s going on on the device if a user hasn\u2019t authorised it.\u201d\nOnavo started life in Tel Aviv in 2010 as a startup that helped people reduce their wireless bills by compressing incoming data on an iPhone or Android device. It also highlighted which apps were using the most data. For mobile publishers, it provided analytics to help them keep track of how their apps were performing against competitors. In May 2013, it launched a VPN called Onavo Protect, which promised to protect people\u2019s data when they were browsing the web from their phone on a public wifi network.\nFacebook bought the company in October 2013 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be between $100m and $200m.\nOnavo provides information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them. Photograph: Christophe Morin/IP3/Getty Images\nVPNs work by redirecting and encrypting all data leaving your computer, phone or tablet and sending it to another server in another location. They position themselves as tools for protecting people\u2019s privacy and security, but that very much depends on who is running the VPN and how they make their money.\n\u201cThis server is in a really privileged position,\u201d said Dochuk. \u201cEssentially, it needs 100% of consumer trust because 100% of their data is going through that server.\u201d\nThis means whoever runs the VPN knows which apps are installed on your device and how much you use them; which websites you visit; and your device type and location.\nThere are some VPNs, such as TunnelBear, that cover their server and bandwidth costs through paid subscriptions and others, like Hola and Onavo, that provide a free service to the end user, but extract value from the data they collect or by selling people\u2019s unused bandwidth.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not paying with your money you are probably paying with your data,\u201d said Will Strafach, a security specialist who has analysed the Onavo app.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook employees have put the Onavo data to good use by monitoring the performance of rival Snapchat, particularly after Facebook\u2019s Instagram app launched similar features. Onavo\u2019s data also reportedly helped guide Facebook\u2019s decision to buy WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014 and to clone the popular group video chat app Houseparty.\nIn written questions following CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony in April, lawmakers asked Facebook whether its use of data gleaned from Onavo violated the privacy consumers expect of a VPN.\nFacebook said that it explained what data it would receive when a user installed the app.\nTech companies have the answer to phone addiction: more tech Read more\n\u201cThis helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analysing your use of websites, apps and data,\u201d Onavo Protect\u2019s App Store messaging reads. \u201cBecause we\u2019re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.\u201d\nUsers have to accept these terms before using the app.\nThe company has acknowledged it uses Onavo to monitor competitors, but it insists this is not unusual: \u201cWebsites and apps have used market research services for years.\u201d\nFacebook said it did not connect the app usage data collected through Onavo to the data collected from an individual\u2019s Facebook account.\nStrafach said it would be easy for Facebook to connect the data if the person also had the Facebook app installed on their phone.\n\u201cYou just have to trust that they are not doing that,\u201d he said.\nGiven Facebook\u2019s recent track record with data privacy, that trust may have slightly eroded.\n}}

Between Facebook\u2019s launch partners, the company estimates that it will serve 1 billion Facebook \u201clike\u201d buttons by day-end. That real-time data on people\u2019s preferences will give the company an accurate real-time barometer of influential sites across the web.\nActivity streams: What a user\u2019s friends have done on the site\nRecommendations: Personalized content recommendations from a site\nThe Facebook login the company offers on external sites will also look different: It will show the person\u2019s friends who have already joined the site.\nOn top of that, there is a Meebo-like bar that publishers can install at the bottom of their page so that visitors can chat with their friends while browsing a site.\nMost importantly, the company launched powerful set of features that will compel publishers across the web to organize their content for sharing and indexing by the social network. These new features could essentially put the web at Facebook\u2019s beck and call.\nThe company released a Graph application programming interface that allows publishers to tag their content by type. For example, if a page is about a Restaurant or a band, a developer can label it so Facebook and other apps accessing the graph can easily call up a friend\u2019s favorite bands or restaurants.\n\u201cYou can represent any real-world object on the Internet using this open graph protocol,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe web has been connected by hyperlinks, between static pages of content. We think that connections between people is more important.\u201d He added that the company had overhauled its technical infrastructure to accommodate this idea.\nThese ideas are pieces of what Facebook says is a fundamentally different thesis about how the web should operate.\n\u201cThe web is at a really important turning point right now. Up until recently, the default on the web has been that most things aren\u2019t social and most things don\u2019t use your real identity,\u201d said chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cWe\u2019re building toward a web where the default is social. Every application will be designed from the ground up to use real identity and friends.\u201d\nAt the first f8 conference, Zuckerberg introduced the idea of the social graph \u2014 mapping the massively interconnected web of relationships between all people in the world. The open graph has a much broader definition. Facebook has mapped social relationships. Yelp, for example, has mapped out local venues. Pandora has mapped out people\u2019s music tastes.\n\u201cIf we can take these separate parts of the graph, we can create a web that\u2019s smarter, more personally and semantically aware,\u201d he said.\n}}
{{By Dino-Ray Ramos\nREX/Shutterstock\nThe \u201cDelete \u201d train just got another passenger. WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who left Facebook last year was straightforward about his position on the social media network when he took to Twitter and simply said, \u201cIt is time. #deletefacebook.\u201d\nHis tweet \u2014 which reached over 21,000 of his followers \u2014 comes in the wake of a movement to delete the popular social media platform after it was reported that Cambridge Analytica, the data firm backed by Donald Trump supporter Robert Mercer and once steered by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, obtained personal information from 50 million Facebook users without permission during the 2016 presidential campaign. Apparently, Facebook knew all about this data leak in 2015 but the public wasn\u2019t made aware of this news until this weekend. When Facebook users caught word of this, many of them became disgruntled and that\u2019s when the #deletefacebook movement started.\nActon has a history with Facebook goes back to 2009 when he applied for a job with the Silicon Valley-based social media giant and was rejected. Five years later, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a popular messaging app, for $19 billion. He stayed with the company for several years before starting the Signal Foundation. His WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum still remains on the Facebook board.\n}}
{{Official census forms are an invaluable source for demographic data throughout the country, but for trends that occur on the scale of weeks or months rather than years, they\u2019re a bit lacking. But a new study shows that similar data used by Facebook to target ads could help fill in that blind spot.\nSociologist Emilio Zagheni at the University of Washington looked into the possibility, in this case specifically regarding migrants in the U.S. and their movements between states. He\u2019s previously looked at this topic using Google+ and other internet-based metrics.\nSay you wanted to know whether East African migrant populations were tending toward settling in cities, suburbs or rural areas. The census process is completed every decade, which really is too long a time to observe short-term trends that follow, for example, an economic recovery or important bill.\nBut by using, or rather strategically misusing Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager tool, one can find reasonably accurate and up-to-date info on, for example, Somalian migrants to the Chicago metro area versus outside the city. Facebook has already extracted all this data \u2014 why not use it?\nThis data is, of course, not the whole picture. You\u2019re not finding all Somalian folks in the Chicago area, only Facebook users who choose to accurately report their country of origin and current location. Compared with the data in the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, it\u2019s not very reliable. But it\u2019s still valuable, Zagheni argues.\n\u201cIs it better to have a large sample that is biased, or a small sample that is nonbiased?\u201d he asks in a UW news release. \u201cThe American Community Survey is a small sample that is more representative of the underlying population; Facebook is a very large sample but not representative. The idea is that in certain contexts, the sample in the American Community Survey is too small to say something significant. In other circumstances, Facebook samples are too biased.\u201d\n\u201cWith this project we aim at getting the best of both worlds,\u201d he continues. \u201cBy calibrating the Facebook data with the American Community Survey, we can correct for the bias and get better estimates.\u201d\nWith reliable but scarce ground truth data and noisy but voluminous supplementary data, you can put together a more precise picture than before \u2014 as long as you\u2019re careful to control for those biases. Data from other social networks could also be brought in to even things out.\nZagheni and his team hope to refine the ideas demonstrated in the paper so that they can be applied in places like developing countries where self-reported data like Facebook\u2019s is easy to come by but reliable government data isn\u2019t. A \u201cgood enough\u201d sketch of the population and recent trends could help with things like prioritizing infrastructure investment or directing aid.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the whole thing required the researchers to abuse the advertising system to expose the data \u2014 surely Facebook can provide better access for research purposes. I asked the company whether that was a likely possibility. Zagheni seemed to like the idea.\n\u201cI certainly hope that there will be opportunities to work directly with Facebook on this line of research in the future,\u201d he wrote in an email to TechCrunch.\nThe paper describing the team\u2019s work is published in the latest issue of the journal Population and Development Review.\n}}
{{Facebook has been making changes to the way it allows third-party apps to access data. Photo: iStockphoto\nEver since the Cambridge Analytica scandal became public knowledge, forcing chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to apologize, Facebook has been making changes to the way it allows third-party apps to access data. In yet another announcement on 9 April, the social media network said it was tweaking what it calls \u201cdata practices\u201d as well as information that third-party apps on Facebook can access.\nFacebook is addressing the debate about why and how Messenger and Messenger Lite apps had access to the call and message logs of Android phone users. While Facebook continues to insist that this remains an \u201copt-in\u201d feature, the fact is that the app\u2019s set-up process doesn\u2019t really clarify that at first glance.\nInterestingly, Facebook will still retain some of this data, as the official statement mentions. \u201cWe\u2019ve reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages\u2014and will delete all logs older than one year,\u201d said Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer, Facebook. The statement added that the Messenger apps would now \u201conly upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature\u2014not broader data such as the time of calls\u201d. That still remains confusing.\nFacebook has made changes to the way apps could plug in to the Facebook calendar, wherein users could grant any app permission to access information about the events they hosted or attended. This included private events. However, this meant that the Facebook Events data would also include information about who else attended the event, as well as any posts shared on the event\u2019s wall. \u201cStarting today, apps using the API will no longer be able to access the guest list or posts on the event wall. And in the future, only apps we approve that agree to strict requirements will be allowed to use the Events API,\u201d said Schroepfer.\nThe social network is also tweaking the login process for third-party apps. Facebook will now approve, at its own end, all apps that require access to any user data such as posts, check-ins and more. \u201cWe will also no longer allow apps to ask for access to personal information such as religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book-reading activity, music-listening activity, news reading, video-watching activity, and games activity,\u201d said Facebook in an official statement.\nThis means that the next time you use the Facebook credentials to sign up for, or log in to, an app, you will not have to see the screen that wants you to accept the terms and conditions allowing the app to access Facebook data such as posts, photographs, age, etc.\nFacebook will also restrict apps from accessing user posts on any page. The social media network also confirmed that the consolidated app controls would roll out for all users immediately. This will be available at the top of the news feed when you log in to the Facebook app.\nThe other big change that Facebook will implement relates to the search feature. Till now, you could search for someone on Facebook using their name, email address or even their phone number (assuming they had linked it to the Facebook account). This meant that anyone with malicious intent, such as someone who has a phone number but not a name, could easily scrape data. Facebook will be disabling this feature.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure about whether your phone number is linked to your Facebook account, you might want to head to Settings -> Mobile or Facebook -> Profile -> Update profile -> Contact and basic info to check.\n}}
{{Facebook hates conservatives.\nThat's the message you might have taken away if you had only casually followed the latest media freakout over its relationship with the social network. Facebook, of course, does not hate conservatives. It loves everyone, and just wants us all to connect.\nIt all began last week when a Gizmodo report featured anonymous interviews with contractors who expressed grievances about working on Facebook's \"Trending Topics\" section, which is a relatively small box on the upper right corner of Facebook's desktop version. Days later, Gizmodo followed up with one person who claimed that other editors had downplayed conservative media outlets in the section.\nThe implications were big, but the actual impact remained relatively small.\nNumerous people in the media industry that spoke on background with Mashable about \"Trending Topics\" all came to the same conclusion: We don't really know how much traffic that section drives, but it's just not something anybody really cares about that much. Conservative media outlets that spoke with Mashable also did not seem terribly concerned about the issue.\nNow, it's quite clear why everyone is so concerned.\nAfter the media firestorm, the launch of a Senate inquiry, and repeated statements from Facebook, the company ultimately released its guidelines for the \"Trending Topics\" section.\nIt is a sudden look into the inner workings of a company that is incredibly powerful and very opaque. The conversation had quickly shifted away from the allegations of conservative bias to something bigger: Has Facebook been lying to us all along?\nHumans clearly had a far bigger part in \"Trending\" than we had thought. If this part of Facebook had not been an unbiased, data-driven news source, could that also be true of its far more influential News feed algorithm?\nFacebook Elections signs stand in the media area at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, before the first Republican presidential debate. Image: John Minchillo/AP Photo\nQuestions about Facebook's media neutrality come at a particularly sensitive time. Facebook is asking that media companies trust it with the future of their businesses through on-platform features like Instant Articles, bots and most notably live video. As former Chartbeat CEO Tony Haile put it recently, Facebook now hosts, curates, distributes and monetizes whatever the media produces. The media is left to the actual production of editorial content.\nThat wouldn't be a huge deal if not for the fact that Facebook boasts 1.6 billion users and has not been particularly shy about changing what type of content they see, be it pictures or links or videos. The media had few options other than to trust Facebook to use technology to create a meritocracy for the content itself, the industry's last foothold.\nThat trust is now in question. And that's a big deal.\nA human touch\nFacebook's news feed is supposedly run by an algorithm that figures out what to show you based on your interests and what other people are enjoying. \"Trending Topics\" was also based on an algorithm, but with a bit of humanity on top.\nThere's a very subtle wrinkle here about what we all seemed to think was going on. \"Trending\" editors, we thought, were just there to make sure things like \"pizza rolls\" didn't end up being passed along as news.\nFacebook thinks pizza rolls are not newsworthy which should be all the evidence you need that Facebook has no taste pic.twitter.com/r7gApFu33i \u2014 tc (@chillmage) May 12, 2016\nIt turns out they did that and a lot more.\nBased on what Facebook has finally revealed, it looks the other way around. The algorithm was feeding editors, who were given a leeway to pick topics and judge the importance of news based on other media outlets. The editors could even insert some topics that they saw percolating.\nThat's far from some diabolical plot to scuttle conservative media. If anything, it sounds like the same way a modern newsroom operates.\nDid Facebook lie about this? Motherboard has an excellent breakdown of what it has claimed and what its own guidelines required.\n\"Did Facebook lie? In a \"the sky is green\" way, no. But in the polished, expertly-hedged, truth-with-a-spin way that corporate communications departments are so good at, yes,\" wrote Motherboard's Sarah Emerson.\nIt's not the operation itself that is the issue. Facebook's \"Trending\" operation looks pretty reasonable. If anything, Facebook's willingness to bring in editors might provide a bit of hope to journalists. As one editor of a conservative news operation told me recently, his concern with Facebook was not about left vs. right but rather the mix between news and entertainment.\nFacebook's curation guidelines are actually surprisingly detailed and more thought-out than many newsrooms' procedures probably \u2014 Alex Fitzpatrick (@AlexJamesFitz) May 12, 2016\nI want to believe\nIt's fair to say the media overreacted to the particular news, but the larger concerns are valid.\nFacebook is the game. Plenty of other websites command big audiences, but they don't purport to offer the kind of meritocratic payoff of Facebook. Win or lose, we all expected that Facebook's users \u2014 not Facebook \u2014 were the deciding factor. That was essential considering how powerful Facebook had become.\nWhich is what lead to the collective media freakout. That's what happens when a dominant company rolls out products without providing much of any transparency to the public or to journalists. What Facebook asked was for faith that it would keep its promise of technologically guaranteed fair play. Now, that promise has been broken, perhaps accidentally.\nBelieving in that promise in the first place was pretty naive. As my colleague Seth Fiegerman pointed out, \"algorithm\" is just a fancy word for a math equation written by people. The reality of imperfect human involvement creates a certain amount of responsibility from Facebook and many other companies to provide a better understanding of what they're doing.\nWhat we do know is that Facebook has been pushing live video in the news feed \u2014 and paying major media companies to provide the content (including Mashable). That combination would seem to be a far more obvious and top-down editorial strategy than the \"Trending\" fiasco. Facebook changed the game and then began picking partners.\nWhich is a far too long way of saying: It's not what Facebook did; it's how they represented what they were doing. \"Trending\" wasn't just an extension of the news feed. It was a mini-newsroom. Just telling us that from the jump would have sufficed.\nNow, it's tougher to trust Facebook. And with a company this big and powerful, it would be criminally negligent to give them the benefit of the doubt.\nDoes Facebook really need our trust? Based on the company's own reaction, it would seem so. Mark Zuckerberg posted to his personal page on the issue.\n\"The reason I care so much about this is that it gets to the core of everything Facebook is and everything I want it to be. Every tool we build is designed to give more people a voice and bring our global community together,\" he wrote.\nWe'll have to take his word for it.\nHave something to add to this story?

{{It did not take long for plaintiffs' lawyers to realize that there was good money to be made by complaining about the Facebook IPO - there are at least two class actions against the company and underwriters so far, not to mention other class-action lawsuits against NASDAQ for screwing up trades.\nThe securities-fraud lawsuits are the bigger tickets; the one filed in New York today claims $2.5bn in losses though I guess that number is down slightly today. The legal theory here is that Facebook lied in its prospectus, which would entitle buyers in the IPO to \"rescission,\" that is, to the right to hand their shares back to Facebook in exchange for the price they paid for them. This is a problematic theory in that the only lies that the plaintiffs point to are along the lines of:\n21. With regard to the Company's expectations for the second quarter of 2012, the Registration Statement and Prospectus stated, in pertinent part, as follows: Based upon our experience in the second quarter of 2012 to date, the trend we saw in the first quarter of [daily active users] increasing more rapidly than the increase in number of ads delivered has continued. We believe this trend is driven in part by increased usage of Facebook on mobile devices where we have only recently begun showing an immaterial number of sponsored stories in News Feed, and in part due to certain pages having fewer ads per page as a result of product decisions.\nWhich was a lie, according to the complaint, because:\nThe true facts at the time of the IPO were that Facebook was then experiencing a severe and pronounced reduction in revenue growth due to an increase of users of its Facebook app or website through mobile devices rather than a traditional PC ...\nWhich ... is not exactly a different thing? In other words the lies here are more ... vague statements of the truth than actual lies?\nBut the complaint goes on, of course, to cite news reports that Facebook told its underwriters to change their projections, and that those projections were provided to some buyers but not others.* And that definitely looks shitty! I'm not sure that lowering projections is inconsistent with what Facebook said, but it is at least shady, though maybe not illegal, though also maybe illegal. I sort of give up; this complaint seems pretty unconvincing to me but I guess the plaintiffs will have lots of opportunities to amend it whenever a new article comes out so I'd rather not handicap their chances.\nStock-drop lawsuits like these are pretty automatic - the same lawyers who are suing Facebook today also recently sued JPMorgan for keeping a rogue whale on staff and Walmart for bribing everyone in Mexico - and often viewed as pretty socially wasteful. The problem, ordinarily, is that the winners and losers are the same: a stock drops because a company has bad news that it maybe could have done a better job disclosing; a law firm sues the company on behalf of the shareholders who wish they'd known about the news; the suit is settled, with a settlement more or less paid by the company. The money comes from shareholders (via their ownership in the company), and goes to shareholders (via their class action status), with the plaintiffs' lawyers just taking a big cut out in the middle. In theory these lawsuits deter misconduct, but since settlements are normally paid by companies (or by D&O insurers whose premiums are paid by companies, or by underwriters who have indemnification agreements with the issuers), that theory is maybe a bit remote.\nHere, though, you could criticize the lazy complaint, but the potential flow of funds at least makes sense. Facebook remains 85% owned by insiders, some of whom (Zuckerberg, Goldman Sachs) had some say in the IPO process and its attendant failings, others of whom didn't but still benefited by a process that, if you believe everything you read, concealed one or two warts in the company's business model and prospects. Matt Yglesias is not wrong:\nThe thing of it is that Zuckerberg did in fact succeed at selling [$16bn of stock at a $104bn valuation]. Yes, the stock isn't worth that much anymore. But that just goes to show that after maximizing his control over Facebook and thumbing his nose at the Wall Street game he nonetheless managed to hustle Wall Street for maximum money. Sure underwriters like a nice post-IPO \"pop\" that lets them reward key clients, but for people making the initial sales an anti-pop is ideal. It means no money was left on the table. Or, rather, it means that negative money was left on the table. And why should he care what happens here on out?\nMaybe he should care because he's only sold $1.1bn of his stock and has $19bn to go? Certainly he wants the stock to go up over time, but that doesn't rule out an anti-pop preference: it maybe makes the next offering harder, but in general, you can see the appeal to Zuckerberg and the Facebook insiders generally in selling out at a local maximum, even if that local maximum comes shortly before disclosing weak Q2 revenue numbers. If you were a creative plaintiff's lawyer you might even imagine that the upsizing of the secondary sale mid-roadshow had to do not only with strong demand from IPO buyers, but also with a strong sense from the secondary sellers that they were in fact top-ticking the market and so should do so in as much size as possible.\nThe punishment - and deterrent - for blatant top-ticking like that is that your next offering is, in theory, harder: buyers remember the fiasco that was the IPO and ask harder questions along the lines of \"how do I know you're not screwing me again.\" In theory. But memories are always shorter than you expect them to be in the midst of being pissed off about a broken offering. So, I guess, why not add the additional deterrent of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit?\nBrian Roffe Profit Sharing Plan v.

{{Facebook is rolling out a redesigned bookmarks section in its app that will make it easier to navigate and access various Facebook settings \u2013 including Account Settings, Privacy Shortcuts, News Feed Preferences, Activity Log, Payments Settings, access to Help & Support, and more. None of the options in the updated menu are new to Facebook. Instead, the changes are focused on centralizing a variety of controls that were previously located in other places, where they may have been unknown to some users.\nThe updated menu, at first glance, appeared to be a continuation of the redesign to Facebook\u2019s Settings, announced last month.\nAt the time, the company promised a revamped settings menu on mobile that moves settings from across 20 different screens to a single place. It also launched the menu item \u201cPrivacy Shortcuts,\u201d where you can lock down who can view your profile or contact you as well as learn about how to protect your privacy on its social network.\nHowever, Facebook tells us this redesign was not related to the earlier announcement, but has been in the works for a while.\nNow the entire Bookmarks menu is getting a makeover, where controls aren\u2019t just centralized, but some have moved to the forefront instead of being buried behind an extra click.\nThe Bookmarks menu has also been given a new look and updated icons. While most of the list remains colorful, all the Settings Bookmarks appear in shades of gray to differentiate them.\nFacebook confirmed the change to the Bookmarks section has begun to roll out to new users worldwide as part of a staged rollout.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into how to make Bookmarks easier to navigate and more relevant for people for some time,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cWe hope this update, similar to the ones we\u2019ve been making recently, will help people navigate Facebook more easily so they can continue to connect with the people, Pages and Groups they log on to see.\u201d\nThe redesign comes at a time when Facebook is being heavily scrutinized over its data privacy protections for users, which has led to changes in other areas of its business as well \u2013 including its API (app) platform, apps\u2019 access to user data, data portability and more. It had already acknowledged that some of its controls were too hard to find in the past, and it needed to correct that.\nThe new look for Bookmarks will be scaled to all users globally across all platforms over the next two weeks, Facebook told us.\n}}
{{BOSTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s (FB.O) second-biggest outside investor has offered backing for the world\u2019s largest social media company as it faces public criticism for what people see on its service and how much user information is shared with third parties.\nFILE PHOTO: Fidelity Investments Contrafund manager Will Danoff attends the second day of the Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho July 7, 2011. REUTERS/Anthony Bolante/File Photo\nComments by Fidelity Contrafund\u2019s (FCNTX.O) Will Danoff, who like other top mutual fund managers rarely voices an opinion about a holding, represent key support for management as some investors seek change at Facebook, but also drew criticism that he should take a tougher line.\nIn a commentary emailed on Monday by the Boston fund firm, Danoff said Facebook, his fund\u2019s largest position, \u201cconfronted some stiff headwinds\u201d in the first six months of 2018.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was hauled before U.S. Congress in April to explain how data belonging to 87 million users was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, and why it ran ads and posts placed by Russian operatives in what U.S. authorities believe was an attempt to influence the U.S. 2016 election.\n\u201cFacebook management responded thoroughly to legislators\u2019 concerns and implemented a comprehensive plan to uphold the trustworthiness of its digital communities,\u201d Danoff said in a question-and-answer portion of the commentary, which was dated June 30 and included in a \u2018Fidelity Investment Insights\u2019 email on Monday.\nA Fidelity spokeswoman said Danoff would not elaborate on the comments. A spokeswoman for Facebook, which has described steps it is taking to combat abuse of its service, declined to comment on Danoff\u2019s note.\nFacebook\u2019s failure to protect users\u2019 data and to police some misleading content has caused some shareholders to call for change at the company.\nActivists put several reforms up for votes at Facebook\u2019s annual meeting in May, including calls for a risk committee and a report on content. None gained a majority of votes, but Facebook later gave a board committee new risk oversight responsibilities.\nPassing proposals opposed by Zuckerberg is nigh on impossible, given that Facebook\u2019s dual share structure means he has control of about 60 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares.\nA filing last week showed Contrafund sided against most of the reforms and backed all Facebook directors in board elections. Danoff\u2019s commentary did not address the thinking behind the votes.\nSome had hoped Contrafund, with $131 billion in assets, would push for reform at Facebook.\n\u201cSupport like this matters,\u201d said Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an organization that works with asset managers to file and promote shareholder resolutions including at Facebook\u2019s meeting held on May 31. \u201cEven Mark Zuckerberg will listen to these kinds of people.\u201d Connor said.\n}}
{{The Wall Street Journal is reporting that sources close to Palmer Luckey, the cofounder of virtual reality startup Oculus that Facebook bought in 2016, was fired from the company for his political support of President Trump. In September 2016 it came to light that Luckey donated $10,000 to an anti-Hilary Clinton meme factory. Six months later, Luckey was fired from Facebook\u2013with Mark Zuckerberg subsequently denying that Luckey\u2019s departure had anything to do with politics. But that wasn\u2019t true, according to sources who spoke to the Journal:\nMr. Luckey, it turns out, was put on leave, then fired, according to people familiar with the matter. More recently, he has told people the reason was his support for Donald Trump and the furor that his political beliefs sparked within Facebook and Silicon Valley, some of those people say. Internal Facebook emails suggest the matter was discussed at the highest levels of the company. In the fall of 2016, as unhappiness over the donation simmered, Facebook executives including Mr. Zuckerberg pressured Mr. Luckey to publicly voice support for libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, despite Mr. Luckey\u2019s yearslong support of Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the conversations and internal emails viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\nAfter his dismissal, Luckey hired an employment lawyer who argued that Facebook violated California law by pressuring Luckey to voice support for Gary Johnson and for punishing an employee for his political activity. Luckey and Facebook eventually negotiated a $100 million settlement for his dismissal. Prior to the Journal\u2019s report, the only public comments Luckey made about the nature of his firing were said to CNBC earlier this year, with Luckey stating, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my choice to leave.\u201d\nA Facebook spokesperson told the Journal, \u201cWe can say unequivocally that Palmer\u2019s departure was not due to his political views. We\u2019re grateful for Palmer\u2019s contributions to Oculus, and we\u2019re glad he continues to actively support the VR industry.\u201d As for Luckey, he would only tell the Journal that the episode was in the past and said, \u201cI believe the team that remains at Oculus is still the best in the VR industry, and I am rooting for them to succeed.\u201d\n}}
{{The patent war between Yahoo and Facebook is over. The two companies not only settled the suit but extended the multiyear partnership between the two, including new deals for advertising.\nThe conflict began in March when Yahoo accused the social network of infringing on 10 of its patents. These included patents concerning displaying content, messaging users, controlling spam, and other topics. Facebook then returned with a countersuit Yahoo was actually infringing on 10 of Facebook\u2019s patents. And Facebook went to the trouble of naming each offending Yahoo product, such as Yahoo\u2019s home page, Flickr, and Yahoo Finance.\nIn June, Yahoo\u2019s counsel requested an extension to respond to Facebook\u2019s claims, saying that the extra days would help Yahoo and Facebook come to a settlement.\nAccording to All Things D, today\u2019s settlement includes a new advertising agreement, which will allow Yahoo to pull Facebook\u2019s \u201clike\u201d data and display it on ads on Yahoo. Yahoo interim chief executive Ross Levinsohn and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg facilitated the deal. Both companies have also agreed to license some of the offending technology to each other. Facebook explained in a press release that it will help Yahoo with \u201clarge media event coverage\u201d by integrating it on the social network.\nThe two companies have been involved for a long time now, with a \u201cmultiyear contract\u201d that allowed Yahoo to use Facebook as a way to distribute content from its site. Yahoo then supported Facebook\u2019s \u201cSocial Bar\u201d on its sites, which Facebook says 90 million people have used.\nThe lawsuit, which began under Yahoo\u2019s former chief executive Scott Thompson, looked like a last-ditch effort on Yahoo\u2019s part to get money. The company has had a number of pitfalls as it tries to stay afloat in a new media industry. The company recently began laying off 2,000 employees and had plans to restructure. But Thompson who was behind many of these plans, was ousted as CEO in May after he was found lying about a computer science degree on his resume.\nvia All Things D; Image via Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook\n}}
{{MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 With its new \u201cHome\u201d on Android gadgets, Facebook aims to put its social network at the center of people\u2019s mobile experiences.\nFacebook has introduced software called Home that makes the social network the hub of any smartphone running Google\u2019s Android operating system. The idea behind the software is to bring Facebook content right to the home screen, rather than requiring users to check apps. \u201cHome\u201d comes amid rapid growth in the number of people who access Facebook from phones and tablet computers.\nAvailable for download starting April 12, the service is part of Facebook\u2019s move to shift its users\u2019 focus from \u201capps and tasks\u201d to people, said CEO Mark Zuckerberg during Home\u2019s unveiling at the company\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters on Thursday.\nThe new product, which can reside on the home screen of Android phones, is a family of apps designed around people\u2019s Facebook connections. Rather than see a set of apps for email, maps and other services on the screen, users will be greeted with photos and updates from their Facebook feeds.\n\u201cWe think this is the best version of Facebook there is,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\nZuckerberg says users can have an experience on Android phones that they can\u2019t have on other platforms. That\u2019s because Google makes the software available on an open-source basis, allowing others to adapt it to their needs.\nThe move that coincides with rapid growth among the number of users who access the social network from smartphones and tablet computers and Facebook\u2019s aim to evolve from its Web-based roots into a \u201cmobile-first\u201d company.\n\u201cWhat Facebook wants is to put itself at the front of the Android user experience for as many Facebook users as possible and make Facebook more elemental to their customers\u2019 experience,\u201d said Forrester analyst Charles Golvin.\nIn addition to Home, a new HTC phone that integrates the service will also be available starting April 12, with AT&T Inc. as the carrier.\nThe move could help to attract more mobile advertisers. Though mobile ads were a big concern for Facebook\u2019s investors even before the company\u2019s initial public offering last May, some of the worry has subsided as the company muscles its way into the market.\nLast year, Facebook began showing ads to its mobile audience by shoehorning corporate-sponsored content into users\u2019 news feeds, which also include updates from friends and brands they follow. Facebook now faces the challenge of showing people mobile ads without annoying or alienating them.\nThe mobile advertising market is growing quickly, thanks in large part to Facebook and Twitter, which also entered the space in 2012. Research firm eMarketer expects U.S. mobile ad spending to grow 77 percent this year to $7.29 billion, from $4.11 billion last year.\nEMarketer said Wednesday that it expects Facebook Inc. to reap $965 million in U.S. mobile ad revenue in 2013. That\u2019s about 2.5 times the $391 million in 2012, the first year that Facebook started showing mobile ads. Clark Fredricksen, vice president at eMarketer, says \u201cthere are some clear reasons why a deeper integration with mobile operating systems and handsets make sense for Facebook. At the end of the day, the more deeply Facebook can engage consumers, no matter what device or operating system or handset,\u201d the better.\n}}
{{In yet another fissure between the US and Europe over digital privacy practices, French regulators ordered Facebook to curtail its online data collection practices.\nThe country's data protection authority, known by its French acronym CNIL, ruled this week to give Facebook three months to stop transferring data on French users to the states and to refrain from collecting information about nonusers, or else face hefty fines.\nFrench regulators claim that the social media behemoth violates the country's data privacy laws because it tracks information on Internet users' sexual orientation, religious, and political views \"without the explicit consent of account holders\" and fails to inform users that it uses \"cookies\" \u2013 information about stores on users' browsers \u2013 to track activity on third-party pages.\nThe ruling is the latest blow to Facebook in Europe and comes amid a major overhaul of privacy regulations in the European Union that will affect how thousands of US companies handle Europeans' personal information.\nEven though American and EU regulators agreed earlier this month on a new, more robust data privacy regime to satisfy Europeans' privacy concerns, that deal known as Privacy Shield will take months to put into place.\nIn the meantime, companies such as Facebook face more uncertainty and roadblocks in their dealings with European data protection regulations. Until Privacy Shield is implemented, US tech firms must abide by the privacy policies of individual countries.\nThe French ruling against Facebook \"can easily happen to another American company,\" said Christopher Talib, campaign manager of Paris-based internet freedom watchdog La Quadrature du Net.\n\"The minute they stop following the rules in France and the rights of our citizens, there is a problem,\" he said. \"Internet users see that Like button everywhere but they never think that by clicking it, their privacy will be compromised.\"\nThe French data regulator's decision isn't the first time European countries have complained about the company's practices. Last fall, a Belgian court ruled that the company put a stop to tracking nonusers' browsing activity or face fines. In December, the company ultimately agreed to stop using Internet cookies that track nonusers' activity.\nIn fact, Facebook's data collection practices in Europe were at the center of last year's court battle over the so-called Safe Harbor agreement, the transatlantic deal that outlined how American companies would safeguard European data.\nThe European Court of Justice eventually invalidated that deal after Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems argued that Facebook violated its terms. Essentially, he argued that Facebook couldn't keep data it moved to US servers safe from National Security Agency spying. The new Privacy Shield agreement is meant to put greater protections on Europeans' data.\nUntil Privacy Shield is put into action, it'll be a challenging period for US companies, since each country operates under its own legal framework, said Thomas Lanson, a security researcher at the Paris-based French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.\n\"The [US companies] needs to find a way to deal with that without altering its services,\" said Mr. Lanson.\nFrench data regulators said it simply wants Facebook to give both users and nonusers notification about how the company is tracking them online \u2013 and what information it collects. \"Companies should at a minimum inform users over transparency concerns,\" said CNIL.\n\"European Internet users have rights that must be respected,\" the agency said. \"It\u2019s a question of confidence between the user and the internet service provider.\"\nIn addition to France, data protection authorities in the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany are investigating Facebook\u2019s compliance with local and European privacy legislation.\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a Financial Times interview last month, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said that \"poorly designed regulation\" would hamper innovation and stifle businesses. She encouraged regulators not to stand in the way of \"progress\" with burdensome privacy policies.\nThere are others who say that European regulators are also wielding privacy policies as a way of keeping data inside the EU, which could be a boon to the fledgling European digital economy.\n\"This digital revolution has created so many jobs in the US, but it's no secret that France is lagging behind in this domain,\" says Lanson of the Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.\nAmerican tech firms' revenues from European users goes to US companies instead of remaining in the country, at a time when the French \u2013 and European \u2013 economy is struggling.\n\"This process destroys access for French companies to create advertising jobs and revenue and instead gives it to the US,\" he says. \"Data protection is incredibly important for EU member countries for this reason.\"\n}}
{{California\u2019s governor believes the state\u2019s residents should be compensated for their personal data, which has enriched Facebook, Google and other companies that call the state home.\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data,\u201d Gavin Newsom said in his first state of the state address this week.\nThe governor said he has directed his staff to draft a proposal for a \u201cdata dividend,\u201d an idea that has been championed by academics, advocacy groups and people such as Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook. In an op-ed in the Guardian last year, Hughes compared the value of data to the value of labor. He also cited Alaska\u2019s Permanent Fund Dividend, which distributes an equal portion of a tax on oil companies among all the state\u2019s residents, as a possible model for a data dividend.\nDetails for a data dividend for Californians are still scarce, including which companies would be taxed and what data would be included. The governor\u2019s team is working with legislators and national experts on the issue, said Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for Newsom\u2019s office, Friday.\nOne group that\u2019s working with Newsom\u2019s office is Common Sense, which advocates for children and families on media and technology issues and helped pass California\u2019s first-in-the-nation digital privacy law last year.\nCommon Sense CEO James Steyer said Friday that the San Francisco-based nonprofit is talking with Newsom\u2019s office, legislators, tech experts and economists as it prepares to back the introduction of legislation for a data dividend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a minor concept,\u201d Steyer said, adding that it could have national and global implications and that he was \u201cheartened\u201d the governor is taking up the idea.\nWhile he couldn\u2019t yet share specifics of legislation he said will be introduced in the next week or two \u2014 or the lawmakers involved \u2014 Steyer said it has two main elements: the idea that consumers own their data and how it\u2019s used should be transparent, and creating a mechanism for monetization of that data.\nHow much is consumer data worth? One measure policymakers might consider is quarterly revenue divided by the number of monthly active users of companies like Facebook and Twitter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Facebook reported $16.91 billion in sales, so each of Facebook\u2019s 2.32 billion monthly active users was worth $7.35. Twitter\u2019s revenue for the quarter was $909 million, so that works out to $2.83 for each of its 321 million monthly active users.\n\u201cWe should not be sanctioning the trade-off of a person\u2019s privacy for a fistful of dollars or a handful of pennies,\u201d said Jeff Chester, executive director of Washington-based consumer advocacy group Center for Digital Democracy, on Friday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way really to easily identify a dollar amount about what you\u2019re worth online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe system is far-reaching, and it\u2019s influenced and compounded by a multiplier effect.\u201d\n}}

It could represent a major step for Facebook to delve into the world of hardware \u2013 separate from its VR entity, Oculus\nThere are already concerns around Facebook Portal, as the device uses AI to automatically track people\u2019s presence and movement in a room.

{{[Germany] Two and a half years after Facebook, its German clone StudiVZ follows the US social network\u2019s most successful move by adding support for third-party applications.\nThe 15.7m users of StudiVZ and its siblings MeinVZ and Sch\u00fclerVZ can now play games from Plinga or Wooga, sing online Karaoke with Mikestar or order Italian food from Pizza.de. After 12 months of engineering and a trial with a music video app since October, nine apps are available as of Monday and several hundreds are in the making. The next step will be the implementation of a payment system in early next year, so that users can fork out money for in-game goods, pay for pizzas or make charity donations to the fund raising portal Spendino.\nThe new StudiVZ apps are based on Google\u2019s OpenSocial set of APIs. So theoretically they could also run on other networks that support the standard, like MySpace, Friendster or LinkedIn. But in practice every platform has different requirements, says Wooga founder Jens Begemann, and needs its own version of each app. That\u2019s why his company, which he founded in January, concentrates exclusively on the VZ networks and on Facebook. Wooga\u2019s first social game, Brain Buddies, is free but they plan to release four games per year and will charge for virtual goods in games. The company behind StudiVZ, VZ-Netzwerke, will take 30 per cent of every app\u2019s sales or advertising revenue.\nCEO Markus Berger-de Le\u00f3n has applied tight security policies to third-party apps to avoid the type of scams that TechCrunch recently dug up on Facebook and MySpace. Not only because he needs to regain confidence after all three of the company\u2019s social networks got hacked and were subsequently blackmailed in October with the intruder finally committing suicide in jail. But also because the German online privacy laws are among the strictest in the world, even Google Analytics is in danger of being banned in our country. \u201cMost Facebook apps are basically illegal under German law\u201d, says Berger-de Le\u00f3n, because they pass too much private data to third parties without the users\u2019 consent.\nTo address this, VZ-Netzwerke works with so-called \u201cbusiness cards\u201d: For every app, users have to complete a form with the information they want to share. False names and incomplete data are also possible. This is contrast with the approach that other social networks take where all apps are given access to profile data, photos and buddy-lists etc. Most users will probably only work with two or three business cards, depending on their desired degree of anonymity. Every app gets thoroughly reviewed before approval and 3rd party ad networks are forbidden. All advertising sales are handled by VZ-Netzwerke, with revenue shared with the app providers. This obviously helps VZ-Netzwerke generate additional revenue but it also avoids scammy ads that trick users with private photos or personal information to make them look like messages from friends, says Berger-de Le\u00f3n.\nUsers can share their own data with an app, not that of their friends. For app providers it\u2019s also impossible to converge a user\u2019s data from one app to another into a unified profile. When an app gets uninstalled, the provider loses all the user\u2019s data. And finally, the social network regularly erases all app user data. After 24 hours the app provider has to re-download the user\u2019s data from VZ-Netzwerke\u2019s servers.\n}}
{{In a few weeks, privacy is set to improve for Facebook users -- at least this is the case for people in Europe. May 25 sees the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it means that European users will have the right to not only request details of the information stored about them, but also the right to demand its deletion.\nWhile this will be a legal obligation within Europe, it would have been the perfect opportunity for Facebook to extend the same rights to its users around the world. But it's not going to. Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed that GDPR-style privacy protection is not going to be extended to the US and other parts of the world.\nSee also:\nIn a telephone interview with Reuters, the Facebook chief said that while he agreed \"in spirit\" with GDPR, it was not something he planned on bringing to Americans. Facebook is still reeling from a double whammy of privacy controversies, with the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica and phone/text logging scandals still hanging in the air.\nThere have been renewed calls for the social network to start doing more to protect users' privacy, and while there have been a few concessions in this area, the company seems content to run a two-tier system, with Europe getting a better deal than the rest of the world.\nSpeaking to Reuters, Zuckerberg declined to say which elements of GDPR would or would not make it to other parts of the world:\nWe're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing.\nThis is clearly a very carefully worded statement, but it's clear that the rest of the world will be getting a different deal to Europe -- and with no legal obligation to comply with regulation outside of Europe, it's hard to imagine that whatever's offered will come close to matching GDPR.\nThere is also, of course, the problem of determining where Facebook users are located. When it comes to applying GDPR, will Facebook simply trust that someone is where they say they are (in which case you can expect to see the number of users located in Europe suddenly spiking), or will attempts be made to determine where they actually are (in which case there are VPN tools to take into consideration)?\nImage credit: Alexandros Michailidis / Shutterstock\n}}
{{Facebook will try to turn its story around today. In its first earnings report as a public company, it will use a positive second-quarter earnings statement as a way to craft an uplifting tale. Investors, however, may have trouble seeing the story as anything but a work of fiction.\nFacebook\u2019s narrative as a public company thus far has been largely defined by a marred IPO and a feeling of uncertainly around its mobile advertising aspirations. A depressing read, the opening chapter is replete with tales of securities lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and insiders getting rich while regular folks lose their shirts.\n\u201cFacebook would like to sweep the rockiness of the IPO behind it by having a solid quarter,\u201d Altimeter Group digital advertising and media analyst Rebecca Lieb told VentureBeat.\nThe social network may be able to do just that. Analysts set estimates of $1.15 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.12 for the second quarter. Most expect Facebook to beat these marks and come in between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in revenue.\nBrokerage firm Sterne Agee expects $1.21 billion in revenue, comprising $1.02 billion in ad revenue, up 17 percent over the previous quarter, and $194 million in payments revenue, an increase of 4 percent over the previous quarter.\nThe numbers should be good enough for a base hit \u2014 not a home run.\nSetting a low bar\nFacebook isn\u2019t acting alone as creative story-teller. The social network\u2019s underwriters, acting almost like ghostwriters, reduced Facebook\u2019s 2012 earnings estimates just prior to its initial public offering. Those conservative estimates have now set a low bar for Facebook\u2019s first quarterly report.\n\u201cUnderwriters likely advised Facebook to beat Street expectations for its first public quarter,\u201d investment firm Wedbush said in its preview report on Facebook\u2019s second quarter.\nSam Hamadeh, CEO of PrivCo, a firm that tracks the financials of private companies, shares the same sentiment.\n\u201cPrivCo believes that consensus estimates \u2026 have been set low by analysts,\u201d he said. \u201c[Analysts] were directed by Facebook management to lower estimates to ensure Facebook could beat them and not have a miss in its first time reporting.\u201d\nIn other words, Facebook has lobbed itself a softball.\n\u201cFacebook management and bankers believe that the surest way to change the narrative on the company \u2026 is if Facebook is able to rise above its $38 IPO price, through strong Q2 revenue numbers,\u201d Hamadeh added.\nEven still, a turn-around tale for Facebook\u2019s stock may have to wait. Zynga posted disastrous earnings Wednesday, which alarmed Facebook\u2019s investors and sent Facebook\u2019s stock downward by as much as 9.7 percent in after-hours trading. (Zynga\u2019s own shares shed as much as 40 percent in after-hours trading yesterday.) The casual game-maker, as a developer of top Facebook games, remains a major contributor to Facebook\u2019s bottom line. In Q1, Zynga accounted for 15 percent of the social network\u2019s revenue.\nEverything but the kitchen sink\nFacebook tried to convey that it was a well-oiled machine with a number of product, purchase, and partnership announcements in Q2. A patent settlement with Yahoo and arrangement with Microsoft, the launch of a cross-platform app store, offsite ads on Zynga.com, new ad units for web and mobile, Facebook integration in iOS 6, and several mobile app buys all help paint the picture of a forward-moving company.\nThe company also started to experiment with serving users more ads \u2014 up to 10 per page \u2014 and giant, but pricey, ads upon log out.\nThe question is: Is Facebook trading user experience in for quick returns?\n\u201cPrivCo expected and continues to expect that Facebook is throwing everything possible at this quarter to beat lowered revenue expectations by as wide a margin as possible \u2014 even if that means over-monetizing traffic in the short-term at the expense of long term user experience,\u201d Hamadeh said, characterizing the quarter as a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d quarter.\nLieb said that she was disappointed in the quality and relevance of Facebook ads. \u201cI would like to see this aspect of the user experience improve and improve quickly,\u201d she said.\nAn education in advertising\n\u201cFacebook started to use real case studies with real data around the effectiveness of combining advertising and social on the Facebook platform. While promising, it\u2019s only a start,\u201d Lieb said. \u201c[Facebook] needs a lot more case studies \u2026 and best-practice examples in order to convince advertisers to really pile on.\u201d\nAnd, added Lieb, advertisers are still just now getting an education on how to run ads on Facebook\u2019s website.\nPerhaps that explains why analysts are so confident that the social network has room to grow advertising revenue.\nSterne Agee is particularly bullish on Facebook\u2019s newest ad units. \u201cPremium Ads and Sponsored Stories generate 5-10x the engagement and 3x the ROI compared to other ads, according to Facebook,\u201d the firm wrote in a report. \u201cWe think this could create upside potential for results in 2H\u201912 [mid-year 2012] and beyond.\u201d\nWedbush also believes the social network will continue to grow revenue in the quarters and years ahead. \u201cFacebook can achieve our [fiscal year 2015] advertising targets by capturing only 2% of the global total,\u201d the firm concluded in its preview report.\nFacebook started specifically addressing its mobile risk by serving up Sponsored Stories in the News Feed to its mobile application users. Hamadeh referred to this as Facebook\u2019s greatest achievement for the quarter.\n\u201cInvestors will be very closely watching to see early proof that Facebook can in fact monetize mobile traffic,\u201d he said.\nLieb concurred, but noted that Facebook shouldn\u2019t be expected to solve its mobile monetization challenges in a single quarter. \u201cIt will take many quarters, if not years, to get the formula right,\u201d she said.\nFacebook may also inspire confidence with a healthy bump in active users. Sterne Agee is looking for Facebook to report 943 million monthly active users, 567 million daily active users, and average revenue per user of $1.32.\nGood, but not great\nOverall, the consensus seems to be that Facebook\u2019s second quarter will go down in the history books as good \u2014 not great. The comeback narrative is still a work in progress.\n\u201cI think it was a lukewarm quarter,\u201d Lieb said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to balance the expectation to perform stunningly immediately with longer term goals. That\u2019s a very difficult balance for \u2026 a newly public company that\u2019s a household name.\u201d\nPhoto credit: Shutterstock\n}}
{{According to audience measurement company comScore, the U.S. online display advertising market is growing like a weed. Data from the company\u2019s Ad Metrix online ad intelligence service indicated that nearly 1.3 trillion display ads were delivered to U.S. Internet users during Q3 2010, marking a 22-percent increase compared to the same period last year.\nThe average U.S. Internet user was delivered more than 6,000 display ads over the course of the quarter. King of the hill is, perhaps unsurprisingly, Facebook.\nAccording to comScore, the social network led all online publishers in the third quarter with no less than 297 billion display ad impressions, representing 23.1 percent market share.\nYou were right, Tim Armstrong (aka my new boss), about Google (aka his former employer) and Facebook eating away display ad share from AOL \u2013 and others, of course.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the comScore data is line with some of the things we\u2019ve heard recently from many a Facebook employee, some of them senior level ones: that the company is on track to record $2 billion in revenue this year, mostly coming from display advertising.\nFor the record, comScore data for display advertising units includes both static and rich media ads but not video ads, house ads and tiny ads (less than 2,500 pixels in dimension).\nAccording to comScore\u2019s data, Facebook\u2019s market share has increased 13.9 percentage points from 9.2 percent in Q3 2009. Yahoo! Sites ranked second during Q3 2010 with 140 billion impressions (11 percent), followed by Microsoft Sites with 64 billion impressions (5 percent) and Fox Interactive Media with 48 billion impressions (3.8 percent).\nAT&T ranked as the top online display advertiser in the third quarter with 21.1 billion impressions, accounting for 1.6 percent of display ads.

{{WASHINGTON \u2013 The House Intelligence Committee released on Wednesday a small sample of the ads a Russian troll farm purchased on Facebook during and after the U.S. presidential election. The ads released focused on divisive issues like immigration, religion and race, and some alluded specifically to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\nFacebook has said that it has found more than 3,000 ads linked to the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg troll farm with ties to the Russian government, and that the ads were seen by more than 11 million people between 2015 and 2017.\nThe House Intelligence Committee had been expected to release all of the ads, which Facebook has turned over to Congress and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office, but ultimately put out only about two dozen on Wednesday. The committee\u2019s Democrats, who were responsible for the release, called the selection of ads that they made public a \u201crepresentative sampling.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said at the hearing that the committee still expects to release all of the ads eventually.\nRelated: Facebook, Twitter, Google face aggressive questioning at Senate hearing\nAlso included in the release was a document containing all of the Twitter account handles that Twitter has identified as being tied to the Internet Research Agency.\nThe Internet Research Agency posted thousands of other pieces of content that were not turned into ads. Facebook has said that the Internet Research Agency\u2019s content was served to as many as 150 million people on its platforms, including both Facebook and Instagram. It is not clear how many of those 150 million people actually saw the content, however.\nMany of the ads released Wednesday came from Facebook pages whose Russian ties were previously reported by CNN, including \u201cBlacktivist,\u201d a page designed to look like it was run by black American activists, and \u201cHeart of Texas,\u201d a page supporting the secession of Texas.\nBelow, a look at some of the ads released Wednesday, and some of the key information about each ad, including how much they cost and how many people may have seen them.\nA petition to remove Hillary Clinton from the ballot\nA Russian-run page entitled \u201cDonald Trump America\u201d called for \u201cdisqualification and removal of Hillary Clinton from the presidential ballot\u201d and ran an ad linking to the White House\u2019s crowdsourced petition site, on which there was a petition that claimed the \u201cdynastic succession of the Clinton family in American politics breaches the core democratic principles laid out by our Founding Fathers.\u201d\nThe ad was targeted at people who had expressed interest in Donald Trump or his son Donald Trump Jr. on Facebook and ran for three days at the start of August 2016. It was shown in Facebook users\u2019 feeds almost 35,000 times and was clicked on 6,000 times. The ad was paid for in Russian rubles, and cost about $240 based on the current exchange rate.\n\u201cJoin us because we care\u201d\nThe Internet Research Agency ran several pages designed to look like they were part of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nOne ad encouraging Facebook users to like one of those pages, \u201cBlack Matters.\u201d The ad featured pictures of African-American people shot by police, and contained the message, \u201cJoin us because we care.\u201d\nAccording to data released by the House Intelligence Committee, the troll group spent more than $2,500 in 2015 and 2016, paid in rubles, promoting this ad. It was targeted to places around the U.S., including Ferguson, Missouri, the place where one of the people featured in the ad, Michael Brown, lived and died.\n\u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims!\u201d event\nOne ad promoted a \u201cSupport Hillary \u2013 Save American Muslims\u201d event that was set for outside the White House on July 9, 2016.\nThat ad was targeted at people who had expressed an interest in Hillary Clinton or the Muslim Brotherhood on Facebook and who lived in Washington, DC.\n\u201cTrump is NOT my President\u201d event\nOn the morning after Election Day 2016, the Russian page \u201cBlack Matters,\u201d which was designed to look like a black activist group, began promoting a \u201cTrump is NOT my president\u201d event, to take place at New York City\u2019s Union Square.\nThe ad was targeted at people living in New York, according to the release from the House Intelligence Committee, which does not specify whether it means New York State or New York City.\n\u201cSatan: If I win Clinton wins!\u201d\nOn October 19th, 2016, a meme appearing to show Satan and Jesus Christ arm wrestling was posted on the Russian page \u201cArmy of Jesus.\u201d The post accompanying the image read in part, \u201cHillary is a Satan.. And even though Donald Trump isn\u2019t a saint by any means, he\u2019s at least an honest man and he cares deeply for this country. My vote goes for him!\u201d\nThe ad was targeted at people in the U.S. who had expressed interest in conservative commentators including Laura Ingraham, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rush Limbaugh and also those who expressed an interest in Christianity, Jesus, and \u201cConservatism in the United States.\u201d\nAccording to the committee, the equivalent of only $1 was spent on the ad, generating 71 impressions and 14 interactions.\n}}
{{Fiona the hippo has a TV show. You won't find it on Animal Planet, and don't bother searching for it on Netflix. The seven-episode (plus a Christmas special) series is one of the most popular series on Facebook Watch.\nWhat is Facebook Watch? To most users, it's that TV-shaped icon in the menu at the bottom of the app. In reality, it's Facebook's big video play, an attempt to cultivate original programming exclusive to the social network, and maybe take a bite out of Netflix, YouTube, and even TV while doing so.\nIn a conversation with Mashable, one partner jokingly \u2014 but tellingly \u2014 called the new-ish Facebook video platform \"Un-Watch-able,\" seemingly a reference to poor viewership figures. But while some publishers have struggled to see traction in their video series, others like Cincinnati Zoo's The Fiona Show have attracted millions of viewers since Watch's debut at the end of summer 2017.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook appoints its first black board member\n\"Facebook approached us about creating a show about Fiona,\" said the Zoo's communications director Michelle Curley. \"We produced all of it in-house with a very small team, probably underestimating how much work that would be!\"\nAnd yet, the Zoo is premiering Season 2 on Jan. 24 (Fiona's 1st birthday).\nTo Mark Zuckerberg & Co., that news is bliss. Fiona is a case study for an exclusive show that attracted an engaged audience right when Watch launched in September, with hundreds of partners, including Mashable. Both Facebook and the Zoo can benefit from that user engagement and that ad revenue.\nDespite Facebook's announcement last week that it would demote news posts from publishers and instead boost posts from friends, those changes are restricted to the News Feed. Facebook isn't fully abandoning video or publishers (at least not yet). With Watch, Facebook is betting \u2014 and financially investing \u2014 on video series, not only from zoos but also from entertainment studios and notable Hollywood producers. Next month, the effort is about to get serious with the launch of Kerry Washington's Five Points.\nWhat to Watch?\nWatch is not an effort to take down HBO, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and traditional TV networks, according to publishers, analysts, and Facebook executives. Zuckerberg has said privately that it's not an exact YouTube competitor either, according to a Watch partner.\nWhile releasing high-end videos from partners may seem similar to YouTube Red, Watch is not a subscription service. Facebook executives have stressed publicly and in private conversations with publishers that the plan is for ad-supported shows, not unlike TV. Facebook also wants to leverage its tools \u2014 Groups, Live, Profiles \u2014 to grow shows.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win by competing with prestige, hour-long dramas. What's going to differentiate us is a show that uses social fabric,\" said Facebook's Head of Global Creative Strategy Ricky Van Veen, appearing at the National Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE) conference in Miami on Tuesday.\nAnd yet, Van Veen came off as a TV executive rather than a guy from a Silicon Valley tech company to those in the audience as he announced three new Watch series at NATPE: half-hour drama \u201cSacred Lies\u201d from Blumhouse Television; unscripted \"Fly Guys\" from Jukin Media; and \u201cBear Grylls: Face the Wild.\u201d\nRicky Van Veen from #Facebook sounding suspiciously like a traditional TV channel exec when describing how best to launch shows on #FacebookWatch - regular time slot, pre-ep marketing on the channel etc etc #NATPE2018 \u2014 Jesse Whittock (@TBI_Jesse) January 16, 2018\n\"Facebook Watch was described as a platform for funded, premium shows and episodes that could create a more serialized viewing experience for the Facebook audience. That's mostly still true although Facebook continues to experiment with the length and topic matter of their programming,\" said Jarrett Moreno, cofounder of media company ATTN.\nExternally, Watch is pitched as thematic, episodic shows optimized for Facebook, a TV for the connected generation where viewers are commenting and interacting with other fans before, during, and after. Van Veen teased the potential of Facebook creating a feature to eliminate spoilers, for example, due to its data capabilities.\nOnly a \"handful\" of Watch shows are funded, and they tend to align with the words \"premium\" or \"optimized.\" Zuckerberg is willing to spend $1 billion this year in original programming, according to Wall Street Journal report from September. A Facebook spokesperson declined to confirm that number, suggesting it's not set in stone and could rise or fall depending on interest.\n\"Fortunately for them, they have a whole lot of money where they can make a ton of mistakes. Facebook follows YouTube in that bright shiny object,\u201d said Alan Wolk, lead analyst at consulting firm TV[R]EV.\nThe first act\nWatch launched in August, but TV-like ambitions have been on Zuckerberg's mind for much longer.\nWorking with creators and organizations to make more \"engaging and meaningful content\" was part of Van Veen's job description when he was hired back in June 2016. In early 2017, talk of Facebook owning \"TV-quality\" shows escalated with reports of the company building a TV app and the hiring of Mina Lefevre from MTV.\nWhen releasing Watch, Facebook went after two sets of shows.\n\"When we were doing the deal with Facebook, there were super premium shows they were green-lighting... and then there\u2019s all this other content like sports and entertainment, how-to, and beauty,\" said Sherry Liu, vice president of business development and strategy for \u200eAwesomenessTV.\nFor publishers with unfunded shows, Watch is an experiment where they must grapple with pouring resources into an effort with knowing how it will resonate on the new platform.\nAlready, Hometalk has found success not by pushing shows with narrative arcs like Facebook suggested but rather by focusing on thematic DIY shows. The site has grown its Watch Page to nearly 2 million followers, with growth skyrocketing in December.\nImage: hometalk\nHometalk is one brand that aligns with Facebook's new emphasis of \"meaningful\" interactions. While they publish videos, Miriam Illions, co-founder and CMO of Hometalk said she doesn't consider Hometalk to be a traditional publisher.\n\"We\u2019re a DIY community. If you take a look at our videos, you\u2019ll see real engagement. People ask and answer questions, post pictures of their own projects in the comments, and share by the thousands with their friends and family,\" Illions said.\nFor some media companies quite familiar with Facebook, trying Watch was a \"no-brainer,\" said Izzie Lerer, founder and chief creative officer of The Dodo.\n\"We're very comfortable on Facebook. We know our audience, know how to make emotional animal content. This was an opportunity to tell more longer, substantive stories,\" she continued.\nThe Dodo's show Odd Couples on \"pet BFFs\" has attracted tens of millions of views per episode, for example.\nWatch trends\nIt's still early days for Watch, but so far, the most successful genres are the unexpected ones. According to exclusive data from Canvs, an analytics company that provides TV networks and digital publishers with data from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other social platforms, the highest-performing genres are Educational, Gaming, and Horror.\nTimeframe: Dec 18 \u2013 Dec 31 Image: canvs\nCanvs evaluates Watch shows based on Emotional Reactions, or ERs, where it categorizes comments or replies based on emotions.\nGeorge Takei Presents is one of the top-performing shows in the Educational category, Canvs Chief Operating Officer Jim Delaney noted, while Crypt Monsters is leading horror.\nCanvs's data showed worst-performing categories were Travel, TV Extras, and Science and Technology.\nTimeframe: Dec 18 \u2013 Dec 31 Image: CANVS\nWhile Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives may emphasize Watch is not a direct YouTube competitor, creator-driven videos are resonating with the platform's early viewers. Delaney noted Nas Daily, a travel show with Nuseir Yassin, as a high-performing vlogger.\nTimeframe: Dec 18 \u2013 Dec 31 Image: CANVS\nOverall, a good sign for Facebook is that engagement on Watch is going up.\n\"Typically as volume scales and time passes, the emotion rate goes down, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing with Facebook,\" Delaney said. \u201cViewer engagement on Facebook watch continues to build and accelerate.\u201d\nImage: canvs\nThat's coming with only a little promotion. Watch appears on the upper-left corner of desktop and has top real estate on the lower bar of the mobile app, but it's still not nearly as dominant as the News Feed, which is the default screen on both desktop and mobile.\nAct 2: dramas\nZuckerberg may not be shilling enough cash to get the next Game of Thrones or House of Cards, but several high-investment shows are landing in the coming weeks. Facebook also just released a new feature called Watch Party for communal viewing.\nDuring the CES technology trade show earlier this month, actress and producer Kerry Washington was on stage with Watch's product lead Fidji Simo to talk about her new drama series Five Points.\n\"We\u2019d been looking to really enter into storytelling in the digital space because I have this social media, digital capital... looking for ways to put content in these spaces where I think everything is going anyways,\" Washington said.\nFor Five Points, Washington is going all-in on the Facebook brand. She noted several ways she planned to integrate Facebook features into the show's marketing strategy.\n\"We get to have it live in the space where we get to combine it with [Facebook] Groups, LGBT community, gun violence, drug use, bullying. It\u2019s really a lot of young-people issues that we\u2019re tackling and exploring. Being able to leverage Facebook Live. Also having some of the cast create accounts that can represent their characters,\" Washington said.\nFilmmaker Gotham Chopra also decided to exclusively work with Facebook on his next project, Tom vs Time, a documentary series on New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\nChopra cited three reasons: Brady's community is already on Facebook, a shared point of view for the unconventional, and creative freedom.\n\"The folks at Facebook Watch trust Tom (and his creative partners) on how he communicates with his fans. That means a lot of creative freedom and voice that isn\u2019t necessarily the case at traditional networks,\" Chopra told Mashable.\nDespite adding these new shows, other partners didn't seem intimidated or concerned their shows would receive less attention going forward. Rather, partners said it will hopefully bring more attention to the platform's existence.\n\"What I think Facebook does it kind of make it a level playing field,\" said Liu of AwesomenessTV. \"It\u2019s just about great content. It\u2019s what [Facebook] is known for.\"\n}}
{{Facebook is the most popular Android application \u2014 excluding the Android Market app \u2014 among Android owners 18 and up. Roughly 80 percent of device owners ages 18-to-34 have used the Facebook app within the past 30 days, according to new research released by analytics firm Nielsen.\nThe company looked at data usage on the smartphones of thousands of consumers who opted in to an ongoing study.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for Google. The company\u2019s Gmail, Maps, Search and YouTube apps were almost equally as popular as Facebook among all age groups, Nielsen found.\nGmail is the second most popular application for Android users in the 25-to-34 and 35-to-44 age groups, while Google Search placed second overall for the 18 to 24 year-olds.

{{Campbell Brown just sent Australian media to the burn unit.\nFacebook\u2019s global head of news partnerships told a group of media executives Down Under that she could help them revitalize journalism. But she also allegedly said their sites would end up dead without the social network\u2019s help.\n\u201cIn a few years\u2026 I\u2019ll be holding hands with your dying business like in a hospice,\u201d Brown (a veteran of CNN and NBC) allegedly said.\nThe remarks came during a four-hour off the record meeting with 20 broadcasters and publishers.\nMultiple British and Australian media outlets confirmed the comments, first reported by The Australian (which cited five sources present at the summit).\nBrown also reportedly said that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about publishers,\u201d even though many news sites have seen traffic drop since the social media site began prioritizing posts from friends and family members over news stories.\nZuckerberg \u201cis giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe are not interested in talking to you about your traffic and referrals anymore. That is the old world and there is no going back\u2014Mark wouldn\u2019t agree to that.\u201d\nBrown has made less pointed versions of this statement before. She said in February that news traffic on social media will inherently fluctuate given \u201cthe nature of what Facebook is.\u201d\nThe confusion over Brown\u2019s latest comments would undoubtedly be cleared up if Facebook released a transcript of the meeting.\nBut the company has no plans to do that. In a statement to Observer, a spokesperson simply said the quotes were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d\nBrown also vehemently denied the comments.\n\u201cThese quotes are simply not accurate and don\u2019t reflect the discussion we had in the meeting,\u201d she said in a statement to Observer. \u201cOur goal at Facebook\u2014what the team works on every day with publishers and reporters around the world\u2014is to help journalism succeed and thrive, both on our platform and off. That means a new focus on building sustainable business models, and that\u2019s what the discussion was about.\u201d\nThis scandal comes as Facebook faces a moment of reckoning about fake news and false advertising. Brown was actually hired last year to fix this problem and build better relationships with news outlets after the 2016 election.\nBut not much has changed: she and other company executives still claim it\u2019s not their job to be \u201cthe arbiters of truth.\u201d\nThat may be true, but it\u2019s also not their job to insult the people who bring that truth to readers. Brown would do well to remember that.\n}}
{{Is Facebook trampling over laws that regulate the processing of sensitive categories of personal data by failing to ask people for their explicit consent before it makes sensitive inferences about their sex life, religion or political beliefs? Or is the company merely treading uncomfortably and unethically close to the line of the law?\nAn investigation by the Guardian and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation has found that Facebook\u2019s platform allows advertisers to target users based on interests related to political beliefs, sexuality and religion \u2014 all categories that are marked out as sensitive information under current European data protection law.\nAnd indeed under the incoming GDPR, which will apply across the bloc from May 25.\nThe joint investigation found Facebook\u2019s platform had made sensitive inferences about users \u2014 allowing advertisers to target people based on inferred interests including communism, social democrats, Hinduism and Christianity. All of which would be classed as sensitive personal data under EU rules.\nAnd while the platform offers some constraints on how advertisers can target people against sensitive interests \u2014 not allowing advertisers to exclude users based on a specific sensitive interest, for example (Facebook having previously run into trouble in the US for enabling discrimination via ethnic affinity-based targeting) \u2014 such controls are beside the point if you take the view that Facebook is legally required to ask for a user\u2019s explicit consent to processing this kind of sensitive data up front, before making any inferences about a person.\nIndeed, it\u2019s very unlikely that any ad platform can put people into buckets with sensitive labels like \u2018interested in social democrat issues\u2019 or \u2018likes communist pages\u2019 or \u2018attends gay events\u2019 without asking them to let it do so first.\nAnd Facebook is not asking first.\nThis is going to be a big battleground. We talk about inferred special category data in the context of the Article 29 Working Party guidelines on profiling here > https://t.co/TjCHqOvcBA (open access) https://t.co/XZB5ypjELs \u2014 Michael Veale (@mikarv) May 16, 2018\nFacebook argues otherwise, of course \u2014 claiming that the information it gathers about people\u2019s affinities/interests, even when they entail sensitive categories of information such as sexuality and religion, is not personal data.\nIn a response statement to the media investigation, a Facebook spokesperson told us:\nLike other Internet companies, Facebook shows ads based on topics we think people might be interested in, but without using sensitive personal data. This means that someone could have an ad interest listed as \u2018Gay Pride\u2019 because they have liked a Pride associated Page or clicked a Pride ad, but it does not reflect any personal characteristics such as gender or sexuality. People are able to manage their Ad Preferences tool, which clearly explains how advertising works on Facebook and provides a way to tell us if you want to see ads based on specific interests or not. When interests are removed, we show people the list of removed interests so that they have a record they can access, but these interests are no longer used for ads. Our advertising complies with relevant EU law and, like other companies, we are preparing for the GDPR to ensure we are compliant when it comes into force.\nExpect Facebook\u2019s argument to be tested in the courts \u2014 likely in the very near future.\nAs we\u2019ve said before, the GDPR lawsuits are coming for the company, thanks to beefed up enforcement of EU privacy rules, with the regulation providing for fines as large as 4% of a company\u2019s global turnover.\nFacebook is not the only online people profiler, of course, but it\u2019s a prime target for strategic litigation both because of its massive size and reach (and the resulting power over web users flowing from a dominant position in an attention-dominating category), but also on account of its nose-thumbing attitude to compliance with EU regulations thus far.\nThe company has faced a number of challenges and sanctions under existing EU privacy law \u2014 though for its operations outside the US it typically refuses to recognize any legal jurisdiction except corporate-friendly Ireland, where its international HQ is based.\nAnd, from what we\u2019ve seen so far, Facebook\u2019s response to GDPR \u2018compliance\u2019 is no new leaf. Rather it looks like privacy-hostile business as usual; a continued attempt to leverage its size and power to force a self-serving interpretation of the law \u2014 bending rules to fit its existing business processes, rather than reconfiguring those processes to comply with the law.\nThe GDPR is one of the reasons why Facebook\u2019s ad microtargeting empire is facing greater scrutiny now, with just weeks to go before civil society organizations are able to take advantage of fresh opportunities for strategic litigation allowed by the regulation.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the GDPR. I really believe that it gives us \u2014 as the court in Strasbourg would say \u2014 effective and practical remedies,\u201d law professor Mireille Hildebrandt tells us. \u201cIf we go and do it, of course. So we need a lot of public litigation, a lot of court cases to make the GDPR work but\u2026 I think there are more people moving into this.\n\u201cThe GDPR created a market for these sort of law firms \u2014 and I think that\u2019s excellent.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not the only reason. Another reason why Facebook\u2019s handling of personal data is attracting attention is the result of tenacious press investigations into how one controversial political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, was able to gain such freewheeling access to Facebook users\u2019 data \u2014 as a result of Facebook\u2019s lax platform policies around data access \u2014 for, in that instance, political ad targeting purposes.\nAll of which eventually blew up into a major global privacy storm, this March, though criticism of Facebook\u2019s privacy-hostile platform policies dates back more than a decade at this stage.\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal at least brought Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg in front of US lawmakers, facing questions about the extent of the personal information it gathers; what controls it offers users over their data; and how he thinks Internet companies should be regulated, to name a few. (Pro tip for politicians: You don\u2019t need to ask companies how they\u2019d like to be regulated.)\nThe Facebook founder has also finally agreed to meet EU lawmakers \u2014 though UK lawmakers\u2019 calls have been ignored.\nZuckerberg should expect to be questioned very closely in Brussels about how his platform is impacting European\u2019s fundamental rights.\nSensitive personal data needs explicit consent\nFacebook infers affinities linked to individual users by collecting and processing interest signals their web activity generates, such as likes on Facebook Pages or what people look at when they\u2019re browsing outside Facebook \u2014 off-site intel it gathers via an extensive network of social plug-ins and tracking pixels embedded on third party websites. (According to information released by Facebook to the UK parliament this week, during just one week of April this year its Like button appeared on 8.4M websites; the Share button appeared on 931,000 websites; and its tracking Pixels were running on 2.2M websites.)\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Both the current and the incoming EU legal framework for data protection sets the bar for consent to processing so-called special category data equally high \u2014 at \u201cexplicit\u201d consent.\nWhat that means in practice is Facebook needs to seek and secure separate consents from users (such as via a dedicated pop-up) for collecting and processing this type of sensitive data.\nThe alternative is for it to rely on another special condition for processing this type of sensitive data. However the other conditions are pretty tightly drawn \u2014 relating to things like the public interest; or the vital interests of a data subject; or for purposes of \u201cpreventive or occupational medicine\u201d.\nNone of which would appear to apply if, as Facebook is, you\u2019re processing people\u2019s sensitive personal information just to target them with ads.\nAhead of GDPR, Facebook has started asking users who have chosen to display political opinions and/or sexuality information on their profiles to explicitly consent to that data being public.\nThough even there its actions are problematic, as it offers users a take it or leave it style \u2018choice\u2019 \u2014 saying they either remove the info entirely or leave it and therefore agree that Facebook can use it to target them with ads.\nYet EU law also requires that consent be freely given. It cannot be conditional on the provision of a service.\nSo Facebook\u2019s bundling of service provisions and consent will also likely face legal challenges, as we\u2019ve written before.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tangled the use of their network for socialising with the profiling of users for advertising. Those are separate purposes. You can\u2019t tangle them like they are doing in the GDPR,\u201d says Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London, emphasizing that GDPR allows for a third option that Facebook isn\u2019t offering users: Allowing them to keep sensitive data on their profile but that data not be used for targeted advertising.\n\u201cFacebook, I believe, is quite afraid of this third option,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt goes back to the Congressional hearing: Zuckerberg said a lot that you can choose which of your friends every post can be shared with, through a little in-line button. But there\u2019s no option there that says \u2018do not share this with Facebook for the purposes of analysis\u2019.\u201d\nReturning to how the company synthesizes sensitive personal affinities from Facebook users\u2019 Likes and wider web browsing activity, Veale argues that EU law also does not recognize the kind of distinction Facebook is seeking to draw \u2014 i.e. between inferred affinities and personal data \u2014 and thus to try to redraw the law in its favor.\n\u201cFacebook say that the data is not correct, or self-declared, and therefore these provisions do not apply. Data does not have to be correct or accurate to be personal data under European law, and trigger the protections. Indeed, that\u2019s why there is a \u2018right to rectification\u2019 \u2014 because incorrect data is not the exception but the norm,\u201d he tells us.\n\u201cAt the crux of Facebook\u2019s challenge is that they are inferring what is arguably \u201cspecial category\u201d data (Article 9, GDPR) from non-special category data. In European law, this data includes race, sexuality, data about health, biometric data for the purposes of identification, and political opinions. One of the first things to note is that European law does not govern collection and use as distinct activities: Both are considered processing.\n\u201cThe pan-European group of data protection regulators have recently confirmed in guidance that when you infer special category data, it is as if you collected it. For this to be lawful, you need a special reason, which for most companies is restricted to separate, explicit consent. This will be often different than the lawful basis for processing the personal data you used for inference, which might well be \u2018legitimate interests\u2019, which didn\u2019t require consent. That\u2019s ruled out if you\u2019re processing one of these special categories.\u201d\n\u201cThe regulators even specifically give Facebook like inference as an example of inferring special category data, so there is little wiggle room here,\u201d he adds, pointing to an example used by regulators of a study that combined Facebook Like data with \u201climited survey information\u201d \u2014 and from which it was found that researchers could accurately predict a male user\u2019s sexual orientation 88% of the time; a user\u2019s ethnic origin 95% of the time; and whether a user was Christian or Muslim 82% of the time.\nWhich underlines why these rules exist \u2014 given the clear risk of breaches to human rights if big data platforms can just suck up sensitive personal data automatically, as a background process.\nThe overarching aim of GDPR is to give consumers greater control over their personal data not just to help people defend their rights but to foster greater trust in online services \u2014 and for that trust to be a mechanism for greasing the wheels of digital business. Which is pretty much the opposite approach to sucking up everything in the background and hoping your users don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing.\nVeale also points out that under current EU law even an opinion on someone is their personal data\u2026 (per this Article 29 Working Party guidance, emphasis ours):\nFrom the point of view of the nature of the information, the concept of personal data includes any sort of statements about a person. It covers \u201cobjective\u201d information, such as the presence of a certain substance in one\u2019s blood. It also includes \u201csubjective\u201d information, opinions or assessments. This latter sort of statements make up a considerable share of personal data processing in sectors such as banking, for the assessment of the reliability of borrowers (\u201cTitius is a reliable borrower\u201d), in insurance (\u201cTitius is not expected to die soon\u201d) or in employment (\u201cTitius is a good worker and merits promotion\u201d).\nWe put that specific point to Facebook \u2014 but at the time of writing we\u2019re still waiting for a response. (Nor would Facebook provide a public response to several other questions we asked around what it\u2019s doing here, preferring to limit its comment to the statement at the top of this post.)\nVeale adds that the WP29 guidance has been upheld in recent CJEU cases such as Nowak \u2014 which he says emphasized that, for example, annotations on the side of an exam script are personal data.\nHe\u2019s clear about what Facebook should be doing to comply with the law: \u201cThey should be asking for individuals\u2019 explicit, separate consent for them to infer data including race, sexuality, health or political opinions. If people say no, they should be able to continue using Facebook as normal without these inferences being made on the back-end.\u201d\n\u201cThey need to tell individuals about what they are doing clearly and in plain language,\u201d he adds. \u201cPolitical opinions are just as protected here, and this is perhaps more interesting than race or sexuality.\u201d\n\u201cThey certainly should face legal challenges under the GDPR,\u201d agrees Paul Bernal, senior lecturer in law at the University of East Anglia, who is also critical of how Facebook is processing sensitive personal information. \u201cThe affinity concept seems to be a pretty transparent attempt to avoid legal challenges, and one that ought to fail. The question is whether the regulators have the guts to make the point: It undermines a quite significant part of Facebook\u2019s approach.\u201d\n\u201cI think the reason they\u2019re pushing this is that they think they\u2019ll get away with it, partly because they think they\u2019ve persuaded people that the problem is Cambridge Analytica, as rogues, rather than Facebook, as enablers and supporters. We need to be very clear about this: Cambridge Analytica are the symptom, Facebook is the disease,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cI should also say, I think the distinction between \u2018targeting\u2019 being OK and \u2018excluding\u2019 not being OK is also mostly Facebook playing games, and trying to have their cake and eat it. It just invites gaming of the systems really.\u201d\nFacebook claims its core product is social media, rather than data-mining people to run a highly lucrative microtargeted advertising platform.\nBut if that\u2019s true why then is it tangling its core social functions with its ad-targeting apparatus \u2014 and telling people they can\u2019t have a social service unless they agree to interest-based advertising?\nIt could support a service with other types of advertising, which don\u2019t depend on background surveillance that erodes users\u2019 fundamental rights. But it\u2019s choosing not to offer that. All you can \u2018choose\u2019 is all or nothing. Not much of a choice.\nFacebook telling people that if they want to opt out of its ad targeting they must delete their account is neither a route to obtain meaningful (and therefore lawful) consent \u2014 nor a very compelling approach to counter criticism that its real business is farming people.\nThe issues at stake here for Facebook, and for the shadowy background data-mining and brokering of the online ad targeting industry as a whole, are clearly far greater than any one data misuse scandal or any one category of sensitive data. But Facebook\u2019s decision to retain people\u2019s sensitive personal data for ad targeting without asking for consent up-front is a telling sign of something gone very wrong indeed.\nIf Facebook doesn\u2019t feel confident asking its users whether what it\u2019s doing with their personal data is okay or not, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\nAt very least it\u2019s a failure of ethics. Even if the final judgement on Facebook\u2019s self-serving interpretation of EU privacy rules will have to wait for the courts to decide.\n}}
{{(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it had identified a new coordinated political influence campaign to mislead its users and sow dissension among voters ahead of November\u2019s U.S. congressional elections.\nIt said it had removed 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram, part of an effort to combat foreign meddling in U.S. elections.\nThe company stopped short of identifying the source of the misinformation. But members of Congress who had been briefed by Facebook on the matter said the methodology of the influence campaign suggested Russian involvement.\n\u201cI can say I think with pretty high confidence I think this is Russian-related,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol.\nTwo U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Russia was behind the Facebook campaign, but one noted that \u201cthe similarities, aims and methodology relative to the 2016 Russian campaign are quite striking.\u201d\nA Russian propaganda arm tried to tamper in the 2016 U.S. election by posting and buying ads on Facebook, according to the company and U.S. intelligence agencies. In February, the U.S. Justice Department indicted 13 Russian nationals, and the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, for interfering in the 2016 U.S. election.\nMoscow has denied involvement.\nFacebook has been on the defensive about influence activity on its site and concerns over user privacy tied to long-standing agreements with developers that allowed them access to private user data.\n\u2018ARMS RACE\u2019\nThe Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which was shown the suspended pages ahead of the takedown, said they showed similarities in language and approach to previously fake accounts from the Internet Research Agency, which is known as the \u201ctroll factory\u201d because it stirs up public opinion on social media sites.\nThe lab cited \u201cconsistent mistranslation, as well as an overwhelming focus on polarizing issues at the top of any given news cycle.\u201d It said, for example, the posts on the year-old, feminist Resisters page \u201ctook a liberal or left-wing stance on issues around gender, race, immigration, and human rights.\u201d Other pages promoted racial pride among minority groups.\nThe group said the Resisters page was alarming because it was pushing for confrontation at multiple protests, including against \u201cUnite the Right 2,\u201d with a potential for violence.\nA man who identified himself as an administrator of Resisters, Washington activist Brendan Orsinger, said on a video call with Reuters that he had been invited to help operate the page by someone he knew only through Facebook messages.\n\u201cI definitely had concerns, because people don\u2019t usually invite me to accounts unless they know me,\u201d Orsinger said. \u201cBut at the same time, this was an account we could use.\u201d\nRelated Coverage U.S. homeland security secretary commends Facebook action\nHe said that more than a dozen legitimate activist groups were still supporting the counter-rally and would now have to work harder to reconnect with people who had been following it through the Resisters page.\nOrsinger said he was not yet sure that the account that had involved him was Russian, but that if it was, he was concerned about he and fellow activists being infiltrated and influenced.\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said on a call with reporters that the attempts to manipulate public opinion would likely become more sophisticated to evade Facebook\u2019s scrutiny, calling it an \u201carms race.\u201d\nThe White House said the administration was supportive of Facebook\u2019s actions.\n\u201cWe applaud efforts by our private-sector partners to combat an array of threats that occur in cyberspace, including malign influence,\u201d said Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has come under fire for discounting the threat of interference in the congressional elections.\nDuring his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki earlier this month, Trump appeared to state that he believed Russia was no longer trying to influence the U.S. election process.\nTrump later amended that, saying he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Russian interference in the election. On Friday, Trump held a meeting with his national security advisers on election security.\nDIVISIVE ISSUES\nFacebook identified influence activity around at least two issues, including the counter-protest to the Unite the Right 2 rally set next week in Washington. The other was the #AbolishICE social media campaign aimed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\nIn an online post, Facebook said it was disclosing the influence effort now in part because of the rally. A previous event last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to violence by white supremacists.\n\u201cThis kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don\u2019t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they\u2019re doing,\u201d the company said.\nMore than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the pages and about $11,000 had been spent on about 150 ads, Facebook said. The pages had created about 30 events since May 2017.\nFacebook officials on a call with reporters said one known account from Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency was a co-administrator of one of the fake pages for seven minutes, but the company did not believe that was enough evidence to attribute the campaign to the Russian government.\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is seen at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F in Paris, France on January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo\nThe company previously said 126 million Americans may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, and that 16 million may have been exposed to Russian information on the Instagram photo-sharing app.\nOver the past several months, the company has taken steps meant to reassure U.S. and European lawmakers that further regulation is unnecessary. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says the company has 20,000 people working to police and protect the site.\n}}

{{Are you an expert Facebook marketer? If so, that could be bad news, because when it comes to Twitter, everything you know is wrong. Well, many things.\nBuddy Media, the social media engagement company, recently completed a study of 320 top brands on Twitter \u2014 Fortune 1000 companies like Coke, American Eagle, Microsoft, and Nike \u2014 looking at what works and what doesn\u2019t to get maximum engagement, and the greatest degree of virality.\nVentureBeat spoke to Joe Ciarallo, vice president of communications for Buddy Media, to get all the details.\nTweet during the day\nOne of the surprising findings is that the best times to engage on Twitter is almost opposite the best times to engage on Facebook.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the interesting things we found,\u201d Ciarallo said. \u201cOn Facebook, you see better engagement in \u2018non-busy\u2019 hours \u2026 after work time. On Twitter, you see better engagement in \u2018busy\u2019 hours.\u201d\nWhen I asked Ciarallo why that might be, he speculated that for some, Facebook is more of a leisure activity, while Twitter is something that people keep an eye on for work: tracking their Twitter news feeds for breaking news or relevant information.\n\u201cBut the optimum time differs by industry,\u201d Ciarallo cautioned. \u201cFor example, fashion brands are not tweeting on Saturday and Sunday as much as other brands, but they\u2019re getting better engagement.\u201d\nKeep it short and tweet\nAnd while some might think that 140 characters is already pretty short, another thing that Buddy Media found is that even shorter tweets were the most successful.\n\u201cTweets that contain less than 100 characters have 17 percent higher engagement,\u201d said Ciarallo. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is leaving room for others to add their own thoughts and comments in a retweet.\u201d\nInclude a link, but \u2026\nTwitter marketers should definitely include a link in their tweet. \u201cWe saw 86 percent higher engagement for tweets with links,\u201d Ciarallo told VentureBeat. This is another difference vis-a-vis Facebook, where links can be counterproductive.\nBut beware: even though these were Fortune 1000 companies, there were a lot of link errors.\n\u201cThe biggest thing for links \u2014 I know it\u2019s kind of obvious \u2014 make sure the link works!\u201d said Ciarallo. Most of the faulty links were simply mistakes, like not leaving a space between the text of your tweet and the link itself, causing the link to fail.\nDon\u2019t tweet tweet tweet\n\u201cCommunities are all different,\u201d Ciarallo said, \u201cand this is aggregate data \u2026 but there\u2019s definitely a sweet spot between one and four tweets a day. When you get over 20, you start to see negative engagement.\u201d\nIn other words, over-tweeting will hurt your brand: followers may unfollow, or followers may just tune out and stop replying, retweeting, and interacting with your brand on Twitter.\nUse images\nIn a somewhat surprising result, images in tweets are a huge positive to engagement. And, it must be said, here\u2019s an example where Twitter does NOT deviate from Facebook marketing: images are also strong engagement factors in Facebook as well.\nIt\u2019s surprising in Twitter because images are not seen by default in the Twitter stream: they typically require an extra click. And it can be even harder to see images in third-party Twitter apps, or the Twitter mobile apps.\n\u201cWhen you see those specific links, you know it\u2019s an image and people want to see them,\u201d Ciarallo said.\nAsk for retweets\nAnd finally: asking for the retweet. \u201cYou should ask people to share your content if you want engagement,\u201d says Ciarallo.\nI\u2019ve always personally been a little shy to use \u201cPLS RT\u201d or \u201cretweet\u201d in a tweet, thinking it somewhat obnoxious. But, says Ciarallo, it\u2019s about spelling it out for people. If you do it too often, he agrees, people will get sick of it.\nBut occasionally asking for the retweet is good social media marketing. Just be sure you spell out the full \u201cplease retweet,\u201d Ciarallo emphasizes. That gets much more action than RT or PLS RT.\nOther tips from Buddy Media include: tweet on weekends, not just weekdays, as followers are still engaged then. And, use hashtags, but sparingly, to mark the topic of your content.\nInterested? You can get the full report right here.\nImage credit: ShutterStock\n}}
{{The click through rate for links posted to the news feed by Facebook Pages with over 100,000 fans is 0.14%, or 1 click per 715 impressions according to a new study shared with us by analytics provider EdgeRank Checker. Pages receive 0.00093 clicks per fan, or roughly 1 click per 1000 fans. These figures should give marketers an idea of how many Facebook fans they\u2019ll need to accumulate to drive significant traffic to external websites, a core way of deriving return on investment from the social network.\nFacebook only started providing link click metrics to Page admins at the beginning of October. Until then, marketers had to use links with tracking tags or URL shorteners that can reduce CTR in order to determine the referral traffic their Page posts were driving.\nFor comparison, links posted by Pages have nearly 3x the CTR of Facebook ads which average 0.05% CTR, and they top online display ads which average a 0.1% CTR according to Webtrends.\nFacebook Pages can be a useful marketing channel for brands, especially those that organically accrue Likes from passionate customers such as entertainment, consumer packaged goods, fashion, and automotive companies. To drive significant referral traffic, though, most brands have to invest in advertising in order to beef up the fan counts of their Pages.\nMost major brands have at least 100,000 fans, and Posts by Pages with few fans have a much higher CTR as you can see in the graph below. Therefore, I excluded them to avoid skewing the data. For all Pages with over 1,000 fans, including those with few fans, link posts still only have a 0.35% CTR, 1 click per 280 impressions, 0.00236 clicks per per fan, and 1 click per 424 fans.\nEdgeRank Checker\u2019s data is based on 84,000 link posts by over 5,500 Pages in October. The study also looked at which days of the week were the best for Pages to post on. It found that posts on Wednesday receive the most clicks and shares, while posts on Friday receive the fewest.\nIf they spend the time and money, brands like Porche, Netflix, and Old Navy can drive around 2,000 qualified clicks a day for free. Facebook Pages can\u2019t completely replace the need for paid advertising, but they can become an important component of a savvy online marketing strategy.\n[Image Credit: Shutterstock]\n}}
{{Share\nFacebook Messenger is getting better. As expected, Facebook announced a few updates to its messaging platform at F8 2018, including improvements to M, its digital assistant, and new ways for businesses to engage with customers through augmented reality.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the new features in Facebook Messenger.\nAR in Messenger\nPerhaps the most important new feature is augmented reality in Messenger \u2014 and it could seriously bring AR to the masses. The feature is aimed at businesses that might want to incorporate augmented reality into their Messenger experiences. For example, when a customer interacts with a business in Messenger, the business can prompt the customer to open their camera, after which they\u2019ll see different filters and AR effects, depending on what the business wants to show.\nThis could be important for a number of different situations where visualizing a product is important. For example, you may want to see how furniture looks in your house before you actually buy it. A few brands will support the feature at launch \u2014 Asus, Kia, Nike, and Sephora. With Asus, you\u2019ll be able to get a deeper look at a phone\u2019s features, while Kia allows you to better see how the Kia Stinger looks up close, and even customize the car\u2019s features. Sephora, as you might expect, allows you to try out different looks and styles.\nM translations\nFacebook is also working to improve Facebook M, the digital assistant that lives within Facebook Messenger. Namely, the assistant will now be able to help with translations for businesses who want to reach customers in other regions. Now, buyers and sellers in Marketplace can communicate with people who don\u2019t speak their language. In other words, if users in Marketplace get a message that\u2019s in a language other than their default language, they\u2019ll be asked if they want that language translated.\nFacebook says it also plans on expanding the feature to Messenger users in the U.S. in coming weeks \u2014 so keep an eye out for it.\nThe two new features certainly seem to be largely business-focused, but hopefully they\u2019ll make checking out products and interacting with businesses a bit easier.\n}}
{{Facebook shadow profiles. You may have seen the term crop up on tech news sites this week, and it may given you the feeling it's a nefarious privacy violation \u2014 or the first fun feature that Facebook has introduced in years.\nBut, seriously: Are shadow profiles real? Do I have one? Are they bad?\nIf you use Facebook, then the answer to all three of those questions is \"yes.\" Let's take a trip into the shadowy recesses to learn more.\nWhy Are Shadow Profiles in the News?\nLast Friday, just as most journalists were preparing to head home for the weekend, Facebook released some embarrassing news. A bug had exposed the private email addresses and phone numbers of 6 million users.\nThough Facebook tried to downplay the significance of the bug, journalists forced to work on a weekend quickly realized there was more to the story than just another data leak: Many of the users whose email addresses and phone numbers were exposed had not knowingly shared that personal information with Facebook.\nInstead, their contact information had been collected on the sly \u2014 stored in Facebook's secret behind-the-scenes scaffolding, where it collects troves of data on you that you never knew about. That information comprises what's known as your \"shadow profile.\"\nWho Has a Shadow Profile?\nWell, potentially everyone who has a Facebook account. They contain a certain amount of information you're not surprised Facebook knows about you: your name, your interests, your relationship status, how many times you've liked your friends posts. But at the same time, Facebook has been able to sneakily collect other data about you. Even if you never told Facebook your phone number, for instance, it might have a record of it. As well as your second and third and fourth email addresses.\nWhere Did Facebook Get This Data?\nYour friends! Or maybe even friends of friends. You can thank anyone who allowed Facebook to scan their mobile phone contacts through the \"Find Friends\" feature.\nWhen someone uses this feature, Facebook downloads the phone's entire contact book to its servers. This mostly includes emails and phone numbers. At the same time, Facebook is also collecting harder-to track data on how you and your friends (and friends of friends) are connected to one another. That's how it finds people to recommend for its \"people you may know\" feature.\nFacebook's mobile app even provides the following message:\n\"Find Friends uploads contacts from your device and stores them on Facebook's servers where they may be used to help others search for people or to generate friend suggestions for you and others.\"\nDo Non-Facebook Users Have Shadow Profiles?\nIt makes sense that, with all the contact lists uploaded to its servers every day, Facebook would be able to learn a whole lot of information about people who don't even have Facebook accounts. But while it has stayed mum on shadow accounts as a whole, the company has asserted it does not collect information on people who don't actually use Facebook.\nIs That Legal?\nIn the United States, probably. Facebook mentioned collecting phone contacts in the Terms of Service that all users must agree to before using the site, so unless the company is collecting additional undisclosed information, users have already given consent.\nBut Europe's data protection laws are much stronger. Max Schrems, the privacy rights advocate who founded activist group Europe v. Facebook, launched a complaint against Facebook's European offices, headquartered in Ireland, citing seven different instances in which shadow profiles potentially violate the country's Data Protection Act (read the PDF here). Schrems asserts that the profiles gathered \"excessive amounts of information about data subjects without notice or consent by the data subject. In many cases these information might be embarrassing or intimidating for the data subject.\"\nHow Long Has This Been Going On?\nFacebook said that its user data has been leaking for over a year. It's been catalogued at least since August 2011, when Schrems filed his complaint against the company. Facebook has had an iPhone app since August 2007, and the \"Find Friends\" feature launched on iPhone and Android in April 2011.\nShould I Be Concerned?\nThere may be cause for concern, especially in light of the recent revelations regarding the National Security Agency's intrusive spying campaign, PRISM. Facebook was one of nine companies the NSA made deals with to turn over information about users. Since Facebook won't confirm that it hosts \"shadow profiles,\" it is unclear whether the information from shadow profiles could have also been passed along to the NSA. But it's certainly possible.\nIn other words, you may have an email address that you've never listed anywhere for anyone else to see \u2014 but because one of your friends added it to his contact list, a snooping government agency may discover it.\nImage courtesy of Flickr, Nicola\nThis article originally published at The Daily Dot here\n}}
{{Anyone with a Facebook account and an aunt or uncle knows that the social media platform is home to plenty of racially charged stories, comments and cartoons. And now a Georgia education official has discovered the hard way that if you repeatedly post such things publicly, you could wind up without a job.\nSee also: Facebook promises to fight hate speech against refugees\nOn Tuesday, Jeremy Spencer, Associate State Superintendent of Virtual Instruction for the Georgia Department of Education, was fired after calls from other state officials to discipline him over racially charged (and occasionally homophobic) Facebook postings.\nState Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta was a vocal critic of Spencer's actions, calling his posts, \u201cvile and beyond the pale.\"\nGeorgia Schools Superintendent Richard Woods said of the decision to fire Spencer:\n\u201cLike most people, I was disheartened and disgusted to see the posts made by Mr. Spencer on his Facebook page. These posts in no way reflect my opinions, or those of the Department of Education. As of this morning, Mr. Spencer is no longer an employee of the Department of Education. My job, and the job of all employees at the Department of Education, is to look out for the educational well-being of all of Georgia\u2019s 1.7 million students, and more than 100,000 teachers and educators.\u201d\nWhile he deleted many of the posts before deleting his Facebook page altogether, Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial writer Maureen Downey managed to capture several and post them online.\nSpencer was also criticized for not removing a racist photo posted by a friend in the comments of one of his posts.\n}}
{{Facebook says hackers accessed data from 29 million accounts as part of the security breach disclosed two weeks ago, fewer than the 50 million it initially believed were affected.\nThe hackers accessed name, email addresses or phone numbers from these accounts, according to Facebook. For 14 million of them, hackers got even more data, such as hometown, birthdate, the last 10 places they checked into or the 15 most recent searches. One million accounts were affected, but hackers didn\u2019t get any information from them.\nFacebook isn\u2019t giving a breakdown of where these users are, but says the breach was \u201cfairly broad.\" It plans to send messages to people whose accounts were hacked.\nFacebook said third-party apps and Facebook apps like WhatsApp and Instagram were unaffected by the breach.\nFacebook said the FBI is investigating, but asked the company not to discuss who may be behind the attack. The company said it hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility of smaller-scale attacks that used the same vulnerability.\nFacebook has said the attackers gained the ability to \u201cseize control\" of those user accounts by stealing digital keys the company uses to keep users logged in. They could do so by exploiting three distinct bugs in Facebook\u2019s code. The company said it has fixed the bugs and logged out affected users to reset those digital keys.\nAt the time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2014whose own account was compromised\u2014said attackers would have had the ability to view private messages or post on someone\u2019s account, but there\u2019s no sign that they did.\n}}
{{What're you saying when you \"Like\" a story about the Syrian Civil War in your Facebook News Feed?\nMaybe that you enjoyed reading the story. Or maybe the fact the story's even being covered in the first place. Or just the idea that whoever posted the article is spreading some kind of awareness. Of course, you could just be expressing your approval for the war in Syria.\nAnd then: What are you saying if the next thing you \"Like\" is a picture of a friend's baby?\nFacebook's the most pervasive single entity in the history of the world\u2014nearly two billion worldwide users. It's already had a massive impact on advertising and media, to say nothing of the way we interact with one another, and it could end up playing a critical role in a paradigm shift of the entertainment business as we know it. And of course, Facebook's dramatic impact on politics (or lack thereof) has been argued ad nauseam since November.\nCentral to that experience is the Like. Introduced in 2009, the feature's become so ubiquitous that \"like\" now tends to be associated with Facebook, as a proper noun: A Like. In 2010, Facebook claimed it saw 1 billion likes per day. And that was seven years ago.\nSome of those Likes have consequences. A court in Switzerland recently fined a man 4,000 Swis francs (about $4,100) for hitting the button on a series of Facebook posts falsely accusing an animal rights activist of being a racist and fascist.\n\"The defendant clearly endorsed the unseemly content and made it his own,\" the court said in a statement. America's had a run in with this issue, too. In 2013, a group of employees at a Sheriff's department were laid off, sometime after having \"Liked\" the Facebook page of the sheriff's opponent in an upcoming election. The employees sued.\nThey lost at first, with a judge ruling that a Like on Facebook is not, in fact, protected speech. They then won on appeal, with a three-judge panel unanimously finding that a Like is indeed speech, and therefore, protected under the First Amendment.\n\"On the most basic level, clicking on the 'like' button literally causes to be published the statement that the User 'likes' something, which is itself a substantive statement,\" wrote Chief Judge Williams Traxler in the judgment.\nAt the core of both these causes is what a Like actually means. In Switzerland, the legal precedent is now that it's an endorsement. In the United States, a Like is speech\u2014and according to at least one judge, a literal expression of liking something.\nBut let's be real: There's no possible way this jives with the experiences of anybody who's ever actually spent time on Facebook.\nParsing intent from someone hitting a button on the Internet is, at best, a faulty calculus of context. Trying to figure out what a Like means is a question that requires knowing everything about the time, place, content, and people involved in said Like. In a world where Facebook networks often include friends, family, colleagues, frenemies, old friends, and whoever else is around, that's an incredibly messy proposition.\nThe reality that pressing \"Like\" isn't the same thing as saying \"like\" wasn't lost on Facebook. After years of jokes about needing a dislike button, the company introduced a variety of responses in October 2015, including anger and sadness. There's still no Dislike button, but people had been given a way to issue a subtler, more meaningful response than just hitting \"Like.\"\nAnd yet, the Like reigns supreme, with way more use than those emotional responses (thanks in part to Facebook's design choices). It remains dominant and vague. In that sense, it's taken on meaning unto itself. A Facebook Like is a Facebook Like, and no two Likes are the same.\nWhere the Like has very definite meaning, though? Inside Facebook. We know that Facebook's almighty algorithm takes Likes to mean that the post should be amplified, shown to more people. Where Facebook's concerned, a like is more than an endorsement\u2014it's a positive signal.\n\"The act of liking something [on Facebook] is the lowest-hanging fruit of interaction design.\"\n\"There's no global consensus on what the Like button means \u2014some do it to validate a friend\u2019s photo or a colleague's point of view, others use it to follow a brand or celebrity to ensure that content always pops up in their feed,\" said Sarah Sampsel, design director at Work & Co. \"Either way, the act of liking something is the lowest-hanging fruit of interaction design.\"\nPerhaps therein lies the truest meaning of Facebook, if one exists. Facebook wants you to spend time on Facebook, especially in the news feed. If a Like is a positive signal that a post will keep you on Facebook for more time, a Like, in those terms, expresses the value of that post in terms of time.\nSo, again: A story about the war in Syria and a photo of a baby might have nothing in common...except that they might both be worth my time.\nOr, rather, things I consider worth of the time of others.\nLook at this baby.\nRead this story. But, really:\nLike what I Like. Whether you like it or not.\n}}
{{There are a number of disturbing elements to the Russian election hacking scandal \u2014 most notably the fact that a foreign entity was somehow able to use Facebook and other social networks to influence an already stressful U.S. election.\nBut what has baffled me most about the hacking scandal is that the Russians were able to proceed with their agenda with such ease, while my influencer marketing agency (which has no interest in nefarious global domination) struggles on a daily basis to do even the most basic tasks on the platform.\nAs the Wall Street Journal noted recently, \u201cRelying on AI can lead to false positives, as when [a] company pulls down legitimate content that its algorithms think might be offensive.\u201d\nMy firm does a high volume of work on Facebook to amplify our influencers\u2019 content. Brands often hire us to create programs with quick turnarounds and tight deadlines, such as a one-day event or a short-term giveaway. Having that (legitimate) content pulled down because an algorithm suspects it is offensive can throw an entire program off the rails.\nWe have had to develop an entire document to detail the various \u201cwatch-outs\u201d we need to keep in mind in order to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s reach without raising the ire of its finicky and overly critical computer algorithms. These trigger-happy software programs can be incredibly problematic. It has been our experience that Facebook\u2019s software doesn\u2019t hesitate to remove content first and ask questions later.\nVentureBeat reached out to Facebook on this, and Facebook maintains that it\u2019s not the case that it will remove content before properly reviewing it. It said it reviews all advertisements before they go live, as per the ad review process posted on its site and that, for other content, it will only pull something down if violates Facebook policies.\u201d\nIt has been my firm\u2019s experience that while non-ad content can be posted without review, it will indeed get automatically pulled if it flags the algorithm. It will then often be re-posted following an appeal. We\u2019ve seen the same thing on Facebook-owned Instagram. An influencer we work with once had her entire Instagram account shut down following the posting of a piece of sponsored content. It was reinstated after a couple of weeks of desperate emails and phone calls to Instagram headquarters.\nYou can find the full list of Facebook\u2019s prohibited content here. While the vast majority of these restrictions are understandable \u2014 certainly we don\u2019t want people posting ads that promote illegal activities, discrimination, or weapons \u2014 many are not that clear cut. The machinations our team goes through in order to get clients\u2019 brands boosted on Facebook are borderline overwhelming. Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples:\n1. The tricky word \u201cyou\u201d\nFacebook prohibits the use of personal attributes within a boosted post. This can be really tricky when promoting a product intended to relieve an ailment. Here are excerpts from two posts that we were looking to boost in one of our programs:\nPost A: Do you suffer from dandruff? It\u2019s a common problem\u2026.\nPost B: Laura is preventing dandruff now and during the colder months\u2026\nGiven the strict algorithm, we were only allowed to boost Post B. Post A would almost certainly be pulled down because of the word \u201cyou.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s spokesperson said that while the company does allow ads for services that treat medical conditions, they don\u2019t allow ads to imply the reader suffers from those medical conditions (that falls under the company\u2019s \u201cPersonal Attributes\u201d policy). Facebook noted that our Post A example wouldn\u2019t make the cut because it implies the reader has dandruff, which is a medical condition.\nWhat frustrates my team in this situation is that our content wasn\u2019t implying anything. It was simply asking the question. If an influencer with thousands of followers poses a question, how is that an implication of anything? These restrictions impact the creativity of our influencers\u2019 content.\n2. Medical conditions\nThe Facebook algorithm is also triggered by mentions of specific medical conditions. Understandably, Facebook prohibits the paid promotion of pharmaceutical products. Unfortunately, this can cause the algorithm to mistakenly flag a post that is related to a medical condition but not related to pharmaceuticals. We recently did a program for a medication-free treatment for depression. The post below, promoting this new treatment, would surely be flagged due to the mention of depression (with bonus flagging for the use of the word \u201cyou\u201d):\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about depression. If you deal with depression, you are not alone. It is a very real condition that affects people in all stages of life, myself included.\u201d\nFacebook told VentureBeat the above post was not allowed because the statement \u201cyou are not alone\u201d implies the reader has depression. Our firm feels that the use of the qualifier \u201cif\u201d should make this okay. We do see how the text is off-limits given Facebook\u2019s guidelines, but it still feels like we\u2019re running into roadblocks left and right when trying to do our job \u2014 and it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re hacking an election, promoting guns, or selling drugs.\nThough the post was honest and authentic, and written by one of our influencers, we couldn\u2019t take the risk of a flag, so instead we had our influencer post the following (less engaging, highly sanitized) statement:\n\u201cMy commitment to wellness has me focusing on happiness this month. One thing that helps is reading inspirational stories about other people who are living their best life.\u201d\n3. Pictures with words\nImages that contain words have also become problematic. Facebook\u2019s spokesperson said it limits words in images in order to create the best possible user experience and that research shows too much text in images damages the experience. While that\u2019s helpful insight, we have seen a marked lack of consistency on the amount of text that works. Additionally, even if the algorithm doesn\u2019t pull down one of our images, too many words can also impact the performance of the post. As Facebook details here, it has \u201crecently implemented a new solution that allows ads with greater than 20 percent text to run, but with less or no delivery.\u201d Certainly this is not any kind of solution for our clients, all of whom expect better performance than \u201cless or no delivery.\u201d\nWe are all big fans of Facebook at my firm, for both personal use and for its tremendous ability to get the word out on behalf of our clients. But we can\u2019t help but feel frustrated when we repeatedly run into roadblocks as a result of an overactive algorithm.\nFacebook serves as a vital piece of our marketing mix. We just wish it would become a bit more reliable. What do the Russians know that we don\u2019t?\nDanielle Wiley is CEO of Sway Group, an influencer marketing agency.\n}}
{{I received the following press release this morning:\nWARNER BROS. ENTERTAINMENT BECOMES FIRST HOLLYWOOD STUDIO TO OFFER MOVIES DIRECTLY ON FACEBOOK\u00ae MILLIONS OF WARNER BROS.

Digital Distribution (WBDD), a market leader in video-on-demand and electronic sell-through, today announced it will begin testing an offering of selected movies for purchase or rental through Warner Bros. Entertainment\u2019s Facebook movie Pages. Consumers will be able to use Facebook Credits to easily buy or rent a title, all while staying connected to Facebook.\nStarting today, millions of fans who \u201cLiked\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s blockbuster film \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d can rent the title through its official Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/darkknight). Consumers simply click on the \u201crent\u201d icon to apply their Facebook Credits, and within seconds they will begin enjoying the film. The cost per rental is 30 Facebook Credits or $3. This offering is presently available only to consumers in the United States. Additional titles will be made available for rental and purchase on a regular basis over the coming months. \u201cFacebook has become a daily destination for hundreds of millions of people,\u201d said Thomas Gewecke, President of Warner Bros. Digital Distribution. \u201cMaking our films available through Facebook is a natural extension of our digital distribution efforts. It gives consumers a simple, convenient way to access and enjoy our films through the world\u2019s largest social network.\u201d Fans will have full control over the film while watching it through their Facebook account for up to 48 hours from purchase. They can choose to watch it in full screen, pause the movie, and resume playing it when they log back into Facebook. Consumers will also have full Facebook functionality including the ability to post comments on the movie, interact with friends and update their status.\nGood idea? What are the potential problems? (I see one: If you lose your Facebook account, for whatever reason, do you lose the movies you\u2019ve bought? Sounds like you would.) Is there any point to this when the same functionality is available from other dedicated movie-streaming sites, such as Amazon on Demand, Netflix, and LoveFilm? Would this make more sense for indie filmmakers who don\u2019t have distribution but can get their movie in front of audiences via the most popular social-networking site?\nWould you watch movies on Facebook?\n(If you have a suggestion for a QOTD, feel free to email me.

{{Dear media companies and other publishers, Facebook is not here for your slow-loading web pages.\nNow, it will punish you for them.\nFacebook announced Wednesday it will lower the ranking of a web page appearing in News Feed if Facebook's technology detects it will load slowly.\nFacebook did not disclose how slow is too slow, but Wednesday's blog post did include a statistic that \"40 percent of website visitors abandon a site after three seconds of delay.\"\nThe news was revealed in a leaked blog post, shared by The Next Web's Matt Navarra:\nNEW: Facebook now ranks fast loading websites higher in your news feed https://t.co/s95PBbmkqD pic.twitter.com/O4yN7AafT7 \u2014 Matt Navarra \u2b50\ufe0f (@MattNavarra) August 2, 2017\nThe update is great news for publishers who have fast-loading websites, of course.\n\"If signals indicate the web page will load quickly, the link to that web page might appear higher in your feed,\u201d Facebook engineers Jiayi Wen and Shengbo Guo wrote in the blog post.\nFor the average Facebook user, it's obvious why the social network would make this change. Facebook makes money by having its users see as many ads as possible, which means spending as much time as possible on the app. If a user clicks a link that loads slowly, they may get frustrated, close the Facebook app all together, and\u2014heaven forbid\u2014go to Google.\nBut for publishers, they're (once again) being forced to adopt their sites to something that could contribute to less revenue. Slower websites could mean a richer visual experience, which could imply more videos, a.k.a. ad dollars.\nFacebook has a solution: Use Instant Articles, its tool that publishers can use to upload their articles directly into Facebook and therefore have them load within a second.\nThough the company does not implicitly call out the Instant Articles program in the blog post, Facebook media relations team has long been pushing the initiative on companies. It's a better experience for the users, they say.\nYet publishers, including the New York Times and The Guardian, have abandoned Instant Articles, for now, saying that they see more success in subscriber rate without the program.\nRegardless of whether they jump onboard again, all publishers will have to prioritize fast-loading web pages if they ever hope to get through to the 2 billion people on News Feed.\n}}
{{Facebook has expanded its @ Mentions feature, now letting you tag friends, pages, events or groups within comments, turning their names into clickable links by using a simple drop-down menu.\nTry it.

{{Warning: This article contains profanity as quoted from Willow and Bristol Palin\u2019s Facebook posts. Also in Slate, read the rest of Emily Bazelon\u2019s series on cyberbullying.\nWhile the premiere of Sarah Palin\u2019s reality show was pulling in record ratings for TLC Sunday night, her daughters Willow and Bristol Palin were apparently going to the mat on Facebook. The girls, who are 16 and 20 *, were defending the show from posters who said they didn\u2019t like it. The fight seems to be real: Bristol has apologized for herself and her sister and the whole exchange has a ragged and raw tone that would be hard to fake\u2014and is nothing like the carefully constructed TV show they were standing behind.\nSnippet of Willow Palin\u2019s Facebook flame war\nThe headlines on Gawker and TMZ are about Willow\u2019s homophobia because she called a couple of the guys she was attacking \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cfaggot.\u201d The language, however typical of adolescent taunts, is shameful, especially in light of the recent cluster of suicides by gay kids. But what\u2019s also striking about the thread is that it has all the hallmarks of a typical teenage Facebook flame war. The Palins sound nothing like image-conscious celebrity kids, and since they seem to know some of their Facebook critics, the fight quickly gets personal and nasty, just as any high-school Internet battle can. Of course, the Palins aren\u2019t regular teenagers. It\u2019s not bad luck that their adolescent misfires went viral\u2014it\u2019s inevitable. One way in which cyberbullying can be worse than the old-fashioned, schoolyard kind is that it can leave a trail\u2014posts, texts, and photos that don\u2019t disappear when the fight is over. Willow and Bristol really can\u2019t ever press delete. The thread on the wall of a poster named Tre\u2019s was deleted from Facebook, but not before someone took a screenshot and sent it to TMZ\u2014and the record of their mistakes is left for the rest of us to judge.\nThe Palin Facebook fight started with a fairly innocuous post from a guy named Tre. \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska is failing soo hard right now,\u201d he wrote in a status update. Why did Willow and Bristol let this get to them? TMZ says Tre went to school with Bristol and Willow, and though Willow says \u201cI have no idea who you are,\u201d he sounds like a Wasilla local. Plus, the Palins have a Facebook history with him. \u201cTalking shit cause you have nothing else going for you,\u201d Bristol responded to Tre on his wall. \u201cJust like you pretended you didn\u2019t know what Dancing with the Stars was.\u201d That\u2019s it\u2014all it takes to start a fight that continued for dozens of posts and drew in a dozen mudslingers and rubberneckers over the course of about an hour.\nThe fight heats up when a guy named Matt jumps in. Matt apparently went to Teeland Middle School in Wasilla with Bristol. At first, Matt sticks to criticizing the TV show and the Palins\u2019 attitude: \u201cman these Palins really don\u2019t like it when you don\u2019t admire them fully, well Im sorry that people don\u2019t like some programming,\u201d he writes in his initial post. But after Willow retorts, \u201cYour effin fat as hell. Stfu,\u201d Matt responds in kind, calling Bristol fat. Willow replies: \u201cHaha your so gay. I have no idea who you are. But what I\u2019ve seen pictures of, your disgusting. My sister had a kid and is still hot.\u201d She adds, \u201cTre stfu. Your such a faggot.\u201d Other than the text-speak abbreviations (stfu stands for shut the fuck up), this is all pretty timeless material. Kids have forever trotted out the gay and fat insults, though one likes to think it has become more taboo now to use the word faggot, especially if you\u2019re the daughter of a public figure and you\u2019re posting the word in public.\nIn the next round of sparring, Tre backs off, though passive aggressively. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be disrespectful towards you or anything, but hella people apparently don\u2019t like it too,\u201d he says of the series, \u201cso there must be some truth to my statement.\u201d It\u2019s a move that both performs for the onlookers and draws strength from them. Willow is having none of it. \u201cYou weren\u2019t trying to be disrespectful? Are you kidding me? You posted it on Facebook,\u201d she writes. Willow seems to acknowledge here that Facebook is a public forum, without realizing that this will come back to haunt her more than it will Tre.\nAnother poster named Imran shows up to occupy the middle ground. \u201cAhh damn there\u2019s deff both sides to this,\u201d he writes. Tre grabs the rope Imram is throwing him. \u201cImran I agree with you Willow is just trippin.\u201d But Willow doesn\u2019t give an inch. \u201cNo. Im sticking up for my family,\u201d she writes. \u201cHow would you like it if I posted shit about your family? Soo stfu.\u201d At this point, I had a moment of sympathy for her. She and Bristol should never have entered into this exchange, but now they\u2019re here, and once they\u2019ve decided they\u2019re defending their family\u2019s honor, how can they back out?\nFrom here, though, the flames get scorching. The fact that Bristol and Matt went to the same school gives them personal ammunition to hurl at each other. They start to relive middle school. \u201cMatt, I know you had a rough time going to Teeland,\u201d Bristol writes. He retorts, \u201cBitch if I remember right you were grabbin my ass in wrestling practice\u2026I know I don\u2019t have a kid, maybe because I know what a fucking condom is.\u201d Bristol responds in kind: \u201cHaha ya grabbing your ass huh? I just puked!\u201d If this seems appallingly gross, that\u2019s the danger of getting sucked back into an eighth-grade fight. For some teens, no subject is off limits online, even if they would be better off if it was.\nSoon enough, other posters show up to marvel at the train wreck (\u201cHahahaha goodness! This is madness!\u201d writes someone called Raven). Willow starts to sound like someone who feels cornered. She lobs a bomb at the whole crowd: \u201cSorry that all you guys are jealous of my families success and you guys aren\u2019t goin to go anywhere with your lives.\u201d This backfires with everyone except Imran. \u201cIma be a dentist :)\u201d he writes. \u201ckinda wanted to be a politician. But after all this I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the last word in the fight, but it should be. Did Bristol and Palin forget for a moment that everything they wrote would be public? That as Sarah Palin\u2019s daughters, their every move will be scrutinized? The whole exchange smacks of the kind of impulsive lack of self control that\u2019s the burden of adolescence, a time when the brain is still developing in exactly these areas. In the age of Facebook, that burden has grown more onerous\u2014a fleeting bad decision might not be fleeting after all. Maybe it\u2019s natural enough to throw some low blows in the name of defending your family. The problem, of course, is that if you\u2019re famous and you\u2019re duking it out online, everyone else will be watching. And you may end up offering a far more revealing glimpse of yourself then Sarah Palin\u2019s Alaska will ever allow.\nCorrection, Nov. 19, 2010: This article originally said that Bristol Palin is 19 years old.

Up until that moment, thousands of Facebookers will be participating in an all-night employee hackathon designing and coding away on what could be come the next Facebook Timeline. And from the looks of photos already trickling out on Facebook, this is one party not to be missed.\nFacebook kicked off its hackathon, Hackathon 31 to be exact, at 7 p.m. Pacific Thursday evening. A crowd of several thousand employees gathered in an outdoor make-shift arena in the middle of the campus\u2019 corridor (the same place where the bell-ringing will take place) to watch Zuckerberg and senior staffers rally the troops for one final night pre-IPO hacking. Zuckerberg, as pictured below, was greeted with a standing ovation from the crowd.\nThursday afternoon, Facebook priced its shares at $38 apiece for a $104 billion valuation. The company will debut on the NASDAQ tomorrow under the \u201cFB\u201d ticker symbol and raise $16 billion (up to $18.4 billion with its over-allotment option) through its offering.\nTonight, however, Facebook celebrates its \u201cHacker Way\u201d culture and, in the process, sends a message to Wall Street and the world that its focus will always be on building and shipping products.\n[vb_gallery id=456959]\n}}
{{British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the U.K., and called for greater oversight of social media companies.\nThe report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.\nThe report called out Facebook in particular, saying that the site's structure seems to be designed to \"conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions.\"\n\"It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,\" the report states. It also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the U.K. Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.\nNYC Students Join Global Strike for Climate Change\nMiddle and high school students joined a global strike in more than 100 countries to call on lawmakers to acknowledge climate change on March 15.

{{Jonathan Abrams could have gone down as one of the world's most successful tech founders. Instead, he spends his time reading and sharing dozens of news stories each week about tech companies more successful than his own.\nOn any given day, you might see Abrams tweet articles about aging entrepreneurs, the latest billion dollar tech startup or Facebook's evolving ad efforts. He finds these articles through Nuzzel, a social news aggregator that he built and launched in beta in September 2012.\nSee also: 8 Brutally Honest Facebook Notifications That Need to Exist Now\n\"Starting Nuzzel was about my own personal problem of having cool stuff that my friends are doing on Facebook and Twitter, but not keeping on top of it all,\" he told Mashable in an interview last month.\nThat sentiment is common enough. There are, after all, no shortage of people building and using social news readers for precisely that reason. But those people are not Jonathan Abrams. Twelve years ago, he founded Friendster and helped kick off the era of social networks. Ten years ago, he watched as Facebook launched and gradually became the market leader. A little more than one year ago, he released Nuzzel to make the most of the new crop of social networks that have surpassed his own.\nHis role at the new venture has effectively turned him into an unofficial media critic. \"Right now, running Nuzzel, I read a lot of online news,\" he says. \"I see stuff everyday that isn't true.\" This extends to stories written over the years about the reasons for Friendster's launch and eventual decline.\n\"There was the idea that I started Friendster to meet girls, to get dates, which was never true,\" he says. \"There was the idea that Friendster's problem was fake profiles.\"\nThe real story, as he tells it, is more complicated and full of even more missed opportunities than you might assume for a tech company that missed one of the biggest opportunities in recent memory.\nFriendster's website in late 2004, a few months after Facebook launched. Image: Internet Archive\nAbrams doesn't remember the exact moment he heard about Facebook, but it wasn't long after it launched in February 2004.\nNot quite two years old then, Friendster had already come up against many new competitors and clones. Michael Birch, best known for selling Bebo to AOL and later buying it back, launched Ringo.com three days after hearing about Friendster, later describing it as \"a copycat site of Friendster.\" Google launched Orkut, a failed early attempt at a social network, in January 2004 after attempting a Friendster acquisition. Even one of Friendster's investors, future Zynga founder Mark Pincus, launched a social networking competitor in 2003 called Tribe.net.\nIf all that wasn't enough, there was MySpace, which was founded in late 2003. According to Abrams, the team at MySpace would spam Friendster's message boards, trying to poach users.\n\"It was a really weird time. Friendster at the time was still a very small company,\" he says. \"We viewed ourselves as the David, not the Goliath. There were the Yahoos and the AOLs and we were this tiny, little startup. But the moment Friendster got the publicity, people started to copy it. Of course we were aware of all of them.\"\nEven with all that competition, Abrams recognized early on that Facebook might pose a unique threat. On Friendster, users could set up profiles, connect with friends and family, search for new contacts (and, yes, potential dates) based on the people you were already connected to and interact with people on the social network through messages and groups. It was essentially a more pared down version of Facebook and the latter had the added benefit of quickly gaining popularity among college students.\nIn response, Abrams claims now that he suggested Friendster should launch a \"Friendster College\" initiative to establish itself on 20 college campuses before Facebook could scale to that level. He says he had wanted to build the equivalent of a news feed even before Facebook launched, and that he had plans to build tools on top of the \"Friendster social graph,\" including one for sharing music playlists.\nIn short, he wanted to take Friendster and evolve it to become what we now know as Facebook.\n\"The problem,\" he says, \"was that Friendster was having a lot of technology problems.\" Friendster had raised an additional $13 million in funding in 2003 and, according to Abrams, investors weren't focused on patching up the service properly, let alone responding to the threats posed by upstarts like Facebook.\n\"The fact that we didn't launch those products was a problem, but even more fundamentally, people could barely log into the website for two years,\" he says. \"By the time Facebook and MySpace was doing those things, Friendster had lost a lot of market share in the U.S. for stability issues.\"\nIn April 2004, two months after Facebook launched, Friendster's board replaced Abrams as CEO and moved him in the mostly powerless chairman role.\n\"I'm not very close to Mark Zuckerberg,\" Abrams says, in a huge understatement. \"But we've met.\"\nThat meeting, according to Abrams, occurred later in 2004 while he was chairman of Friendster and Scott Sassa was its president and CEO. Friendster wanted to buy Facebook. Abrams declined to provide a precise acquisition offer, but suggested it wasn't large enough to interest Zuckerberg and his team at the time.\n\"I never thought he would sell to Friendster, but one of the CEOs was interested in trying to pursue it,\" Abrams says, referring to Sassa.\nSome six years later, the two businesses entered into an acquisition agreement of a different sort: Facebook bought Friendster's entire portfolio of social networking patents for a reported $40 million. By this time, Facebook was on the cusp of hitting 500 million users worldwide, and Friendster had drifted into irrelevance \u2014 at least in the western hemisphere.\nLike minidisc players and QR codes, Friendster made its last stand in Asia. The social network was acquired in 2009 \u2014 not by \"goliaths\" like Yahoo or AOL, or Google, which had offered to buy it years earlier \u2014 by MOL Global, an online payments provider based in Malaysia. Friendster had 115 million members at the time of the acquisition, the vast majority of which (more than 75 million) lived in Asia.\nA little more than a year later, Friendster started again from scratch, deleting its users' data and pivoting to become a gaming service. Friendster.com still exists today, though it bares little resemblance to the Friendster of old. It's currently ranked as the 20,815th most popular site in the world, according to data from Alexa, with most of its visitors coming from India, Malaysia and the Philippines. Facebook is the second most popular site the world.\nThe inside of Slide, a San Francisco nightclub that Abrams co-owns. Image: Facebook, Slide SF\nIt takes some effort to find references to Friendster today on Nuzzel's website, despite the fact that the startup has several former Friendster employees on staff. The word isn't listed on the main page of the beta site; it first appears below the fold on the About page as part of Abrams' bio, sandwiched between two other startups he's worked on.\nAbrams is still proud of Friendster, but he prefers not to talk about those days, noting in the first of several curt email exchanges that he doesn't have time for \"old stuff about Friendster.\"\nShortly after leaving the social network he founded in 2005, Abrams launched Socializr, an online tool for sharing events, which later laid off its team in 2009 and was acquired the following year. He is the cofounder of Founders Den, which provides shared office space, and occasionally does some angel investing. He even co-owns a nightclub in San Francisco called Slide, though he says he doesn't go out to nightclubs much anymore for the same reason he doesn't use Snapchat.\n\"Part of it is where I'm at with my personal life right now. I'm not single, I'm a parent. I'm not using Tinder and Snapchat; I'm just not there in my life,\" he says. \"When I started Friendster 11 years ago, I was not in my 20s, but in my 30s, and I was single and it was a different stage for me.\"\nAbrams does have accounts on Facebook and Twitter, though he prefers the latter and rarely uses either for personal purposes. Mostly he prefers email.\nFriendster may be relegated to punchline-status these days, but Abrams argues the startup had a positive impact on his life overall.\n\"Whenever you step out and do something, you are going to get both positive and negative feedback. That's just what happens when you create things,\" he says. \"Absolutely there are people who have criticized me for things involving Friendster \u2014 sometimes things that are not true. But overall, most of the legacy of Friendster is pretty positive. And there are a lot of connections and relationships that I have that may have been started because of Friendster.\"\nFor now, Abrams continues to work on developing Nuzzel and suggests the news reader may finally come out of beta in the near future. As it so happens, though, Facebook just launched a social news reader of its own. Ten years later, Abrams may end up competing with Facebook all over again.\n}}

{{Facebook now has its own instant messaging app, called Facebook Messenger. The app, which is available for Android and iOS devices, lets you send messages instantly to anyone in your Facebook friends list.\nThe app will also let you send messages to people on your mobile contacts list, and send out group messages too. We suspect that could come in handy if you're trying to organise a, er, group meet-up. If you receive a message, your phone will notify you, so you won't have to keep refreshing the app to see what your buddies are saying.\nThe app goes toe-to-toe with services such as BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), which is a near-identical messaging tool for BlackBerry users, and Google+ Huddle.\nWhether the idea takes off will depend on how good the actual app is. We've been sorely unimpressed with the official Facebook iPhone app, which has more bugs than an entomology convention. It looks like Facebook has big plans for Facebook Messenger in the future, though -- 9to5Mac has spotted hidden code that suggests the House of Zuck will be adding video conferencing.\nThe app will trouble mobile network operators, who make money from charging people to send text messages. Facebook Messenger will use a (probably small) amount of mobile data if you're using it over 3G rather than Wi-Fi, but other than that it's completely free, and allows people to stay in touch without the use of pricey texts.\nThe announcement of Facebook Messenger comes at a rather inopportune time. Thanks to the part BlackBerry Messenger played in this week's UK riots, fast and free group messaging apps like this one are feeling the weight of public scrutiny.\nFacebook Messenger is available in the US right now, but hasn't made it to UK app stores.

{{Josh Rahn, a director of sales for Facebook, gave Web marketers some real-time ammunition in the battle to win attention from the corporate office.\n\u201cEvery communication is a link,\u201d Rahn said. \u201cI just walked past the Coach store after the Coach presentation, and there was somebody taking a picture of somebody in front of the store. I guarantee you they were posting it.\u201d\nThis story first appeared in the June 9, 2010 issue of WWD. Subscribe Today.\nSEE ALL COVERAGE FROM WWD\u2019S SOCIAL MEDIA FORUM HERE >>\nTo connect with consumers and encourage such links, Rahn advised firms to develop a strong sense of brand character online.\n\u201cYou spent 50 to 100 years trying to figure out how to differentiate yourself in print, think about what your identity is online,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes you different than the brand next to you\u2026.Not just because you have a promotion in August, but where do you want to be in a year?\u201d\nWith a clear online identity established, Rahn said brands can begin to really leverage social media. By way of example, he pointed to Levi\u2019s, which, he said, recently threw \u201cthe Facebook kitchen sink\u201d at its Web site. Among other functions, visitors who log on to the denim brand\u2019s site through their Facebook accounts can now see their friends\u2019 birthdays. Rahn said the function could spur gift sales and was a harbinger of things to come.\n\u201cIn the next five years, you\u2019re not going to go to Amazon and see the top five products for sale,\u201d Rahn said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the top five songs at iTunes. You\u2019re going to see the top five products of your friends. Think about what that means when you go to levis.com, and now you\u2019re seeing \u2014 instead of seeing all the jeans that they\u2019re selling \u2014 only the jeans that people like the most, and, most importantly, the jeans that your friends like the most. That fundamentally changes the way that you shop and consume content.\u201d\nAnd for those in the audience who still needed to get the rest of their company on board with their social media program, Rahn offered a one-word pitch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about marketing.

{{On Friday, Facebook released a series of upgrades to its platform, allowing developers access to many core functionalities, such as Facebook Video and Notes, and giving them the ability to integrate them into their applications. But it was the opening up of a Status API that got the most attention. Given that Twitter had rightfully rejected a $500 million offer from Facebook, it\u2019s been perceived as a Twitter-killer. VentureBeat did a good job of explaining why the Facebook vs. Twitter meme was a case of severe hyperbole.\nIn reality the decision to give broader access to its status application programming interface (API) is a recognition by Facebook that status and presence are core to its future as a real-time web company. Facebook developers I spoke with explained that, by allowing third-party developers access to Status, Facebook is hoping to compete with Twitter, which has slowly started to steal developer mindshare away from other platforms. When it comes to the Internet, real time web is obviously the next logical step. Status and presence are key components of this future, and it is good to see Facebook to recognize this and openup its platform in a more meaningful way. But as TechCrunch points out, \u201cstatus\u201d has a different meaning on Facebook and Twitter. The guys at Twitter say they\u2019re not too worried about Facebook\u2019s moves. In response to my emailed query, Biz Stone, the co-founder of Twitter, wrote:\nIt seems like great news for developers. No doubt we\u2019ll soon see some very cool applications providing more ways for friends to share status, links, notes, and videos. Lots of folks are saying \u201chello\u201d to Twitter every day. There is overlap in some aspects of our services but there is also plenty of room for Twitter to grow, evolve, and become relevant to many more lives around the world.\nI totally agree. While the company still struggles with its identity (a service provider or a platform?), the Twitter API has some serious developer mindshare. On an almost daily basis I am contacted by developers who are doing interesting things with it (though admittedly the API has some serious challenges).\nBrendan Gahan, my research assistant, points out on his blog that \u201cwith Open Social, Twitter, Android and iPhone, Facebook has more competition for developers than ever before. If they want the platform to survive, they\u2019ve got to keep developers happy, as opposed to crushing their spirits and shrinking their profits.\u201d\nStatus API is part of that move \u2014 killing Twitter will have to wait for a while!\n}}
{{It looks like has a while before any government will be happy to leave it to its own devices again.\nLess than three days after the social platform submitted more than 700 pages of replies to questions from the U.S. Congress on its use and management of user data that revealed, among other things, that it shared data with hardware and software developers after it stopped doing so with app makers in 2015, took another grilling in the European Parliament.\nAlthough Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operations officer, was scheduled to appear for another round of questions by EU legislators regarding its actions before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, including foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum, Richard Allan, vice president of policy solutions, was sent instead.\nThe hearing was billed as one to focus on \u201csolutions and remedies\u201d to the misuse of user data, as well as Facebook as a whole, but Allan did quite a job of seeming to answer questions without offering up much, if any, detail.\nHe said Facebook has undertaken \u201ca series of measures to limit the scope of abuse,\u201d like identifying third-party applications that are \u201cproblematic\u201d and the \u201cwinding down\u201d of relationships with device manufacturers. But again, as has been the case with a number of public interrogations of Facebook, Allan was in mea culpa mode. While he avoided apologizing directly (that\u2019s been done repeatedly), he acknowledged Facebook\u2019s errors, while positioning the platform as one that\u2019s experiencing some growing pains.\n\u201cWe were not alive to the threat of GSR,\u201d Allan said, referring to the licensee that provided user data to Cambridge Analytica.\nNow Facebook intends to have an entire cyber security team to monitor all major elections, which it did most recently in Italy, in addition to doubling the size of its 10,000-member permanent team.\nAllan added that Facebook has more recently found itself \u201coften apologizing for mistakes and there\u2019s a frustration that we come around to apologize\u2026 we should get better at identifying problems early and responding to them.\u201d\nTied up in this is Facebook\u2019s affiliation with fake news, which the platform is in the process of developing a \u201ccode of practice\u201d around. Members of the EU Parliament seemed particularly incensed with the fake news aspect \u2014 at least a few seemed to believe it had a hand in the Brexit referendum vote in 2016, which some members made clear they\u2019re looking for a way to overturn.\nBut Allan didn\u2019t have too much information to give on the prospect of outside interference being at the root of the Brexit vote. He did admit that getting fake news under control in Europe \u201cwill be a challenge \u2014 we should be honest about that,\u201d citing the multiple languages and media landscapes to contend with.\nAlthough all of Facebook\u2019s problems with data, privacy and security arguably stem from its being an ad-based platform, which keeps it free, Allan didn\u2019t indicate there is any serious movement away from this model.\n\u201cThe advertising model allows us to deliver a very large and quite expensive service to people around the world,\u201d Allan said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an interesting conversation going on around advertising [in the industry]\u2026 it seems the right price point for us is free.\u201d\nIn a bit of semantics, Allan denied that Facebook\u2019s business model relies on the sale of user data, although advertisers flock to and rely on the site mainly because of its ability to target ads by leveraging user data. He explained the fine line: \u201cIt\u2019s not about selling the data \u2014 it\u2019s about selling the advertising space that is informed by the data.\u201d\nNevertheless, Allan admitted that users are getting much more savvy around their data, noticing what they\u2019ve been giving away all this time must be worth something to cause such an uproar.\n\u201cPeople are becoming much more demanding,\u201d Allan said. \u201cThey\u2019re more aware of the value of their data and more aware there are multiple apps they can go to.\u201d\nFor More, See:\nFacebook Forcing Advertisers Into Privacy Changes\nL.A.

{{Facebook is finally launching local Deals \u2014 a feature that will compete with Groupon's core product, not Foursquare's \u2014 in five cities starting Tuesday.\nThe five communities in question are San Francisco, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta and San Diego. Facebook revealed to The New York Times that the local offers made to Deals users will be delivered via email and will also appear in users' news feeds.\nAny Facebook user can sign up for Deals notifications on the feature's landing page now; users in the five test cities will be able to see and use Deals within a few hours of the writing of this post.\nUPDATE: We've now got screenshots of the all-new Deals.\nFacebook's first local deals product was announced as part of Facebook's overarching locations feature, Places. Mobile checkins were linked to deals; in this way, Deals served as an incentive for Facebook users to integrate Facebook Places in their daily lives \u2014 and they were also an incentive for marketers and major brands to put more money into the Facebook platform. Facebook even briefly launched a page to let web users find these checkin-focused deals on the web.\nHowever, the new Deals will be less like a Foursquare coupon awarded to the user after a checkin and more like a Groupon voucher, which means the user will buy a certificate for a certain good or service at a steep discount, typically half off its retail price, then redeem it later.\nExamples of the new breed of Facebook Deals from brands include \"unlimited bowling with six friends for an evening for $60 (75% off)\" and \"luxury winery tour and 25% off all wine purchases for $50.\"\nPerhaps most importantly, users will be able to buy Deals using Facebook Credits, paving a smooth path between a virtual currency and real-world goods and services. We suspected Facebook had plans to bring Credits to the real world since around the time of f8, the company's developer conference, when Facebook announced its ambitious Open Graph.\nUsers will also be able to buy Deals with major credit cards.\nImage based on a photo from Flickr user stevendepolo.\n}}

{{YouTube, Facebook, and Apple have taken steps to remove content associated with InfoWars and its founder Alex Jones.\nEach social media platform said Monday that it had removed content from Jones or InfoWars because it had violated their policies. The companies\u2019 moves shut down key distribution channels that had given the controversial media figure easy access to millions of internet users.\nThe most dramatic action came last, from YouTube, which is owned by Google. It removed many top channels associated with InfoWars, including The Alex Jones Channel, which had 2.4 million subscribers and videos that were viewed over 1.5 billion times.\n\u201cWhen users violate \u2026 policies repeatedly, like our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures, we terminate their accounts,\u201d said a spokesperson for YouTube.\nSome channels for some of InfoWars\u2019 top personalities were still on the platform, however.\nInfoWars is notorious for spreading demonstrably false information and conspiracy theories on a host of issues. It has suggested that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, and that the September 11 terrorist attacks were an inside job orchestrated by the US government.\nInfoWars did not respond to a request for comment.\nBut in a message posted Monday on Twitter, Jones encouraged users to access live streams directly from the InfoWars website. He described it as \u201cthe one platform that they CAN\u2019T ban.\u201d\nEarlier on Monday, Facebook removed four pages associated with InfoWars and Jones for repeated violations of its policies.\nThe social media platform said in a statement that it had \u201cunpublished\u201d the Alex Jones Channel Page, the Alex Jones Page, the InfoWars Page and the Infowars Nightly News Page.\nFacebook removed four videos from the pages last week after determining that they violated its hate speech and bullying policies. It also suspended the personal profile of Jones.\nThe company said that more content from the pages had since been reported, and it had decided to remove them for \u201crepeated violations of community standards and accumulating too many strikes.\u201d\n\u201cUpon review, we have taken it down for glorifying violence \u2026 and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies,\u201d said Facebook.\nThe pages displayed the following message when accessed Monday: \u201cSorry, this content isn\u2019t available right now.\u201d\nFacebook said the page administrators would be able to appeal its decision. In the absence of an appeal, or it the appeal fails, the pages will be permanently deleted.\nFor weeks, Facebook has suffered a public relations crisis over how it handles misinformation and false news on its platforms. The company said the removal of the four pages on Monday was unrelated.\n\u201cWhile much of the discussion around InfoWars has been related to false news \u2026 none of the violations that spurred today\u2019s removals were related to this,\u201d it said in a statement.\nBuzzFeed News reported on Sunday that Apple had removed five podcasts associated with InfoWars from iTunes and its podcast app.\n\u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users,\u201d it said in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News.\n\u201cPodcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming.

{{He just can't keep you people happy.\nFacebook reported its earnings for the first time today, giving investors their first peek at the company\u2019s finances since its botched public offering in May.\nIn the buildup to the earnings release, the social network did everything right \u2014 steered analysts to a relatively modest consensus view (12 cents a share and $1.15 billion in revenue), reported numbers that were equal to or slightly better than those estimates (12 cents a share, $1.18 billion), and enjoyed a few minutes of market euphoria.\nBut Wall Street changed its mind. After an initial boost, Facebook\u2019s share price fell to around $24 in after-market trading, its all-time low.\nWhat happened?\nWell, it seems that once investors read to the end of Facebook\u2019s earnings release, they saw that the things they liked (better-than-expected revenue, a growth to 955 million monthly active users) were trumped by the things that scared the hell out of them. Namely, a 213 percent year-over-year growth in capital expenditures (in English, that\u2019s \u201cFacebook spent a lot of money this quarter on stuff, like new offices in New York\u201c) and a worrying decrease in operating margin (Translated: \u201cFacebook squeezed less profit out of every dollar in sales\u201d).\nMore worrisome, I suspect, is the data behind this chart (via Michael Comeau), which shows that, although Facebook is gaining users, it isn\u2019t gaining them as quickly as it used to.\nToday\u2019s results, and the stock panic that followed, have again confirmed Zuckerberg\u2019s hunch that making Facebook a public company \u2014 with all the short-termist hysteria that accompanies public stocks \u2014 would be a tremendous pain in the ass.\nBut they also point to a life of ever-higher expectations for Facebook as it matures in the public market. In future quarters, it won\u2019t be enough for Facebook to expand its developer base, add tens of millions of users a quarter, and make Scrooge McDuck\u2013type money from mobile ads. To keep investors happy and the stock price in sunshine, it will have to do all of those things plus hit other, less-exciting financial targets.\nIt\u2019s enough to make even Zuckerberg, whose pep was somewhat muted when he joined a conference call with analysts this afternoon, sound like the saddest billionaire in town.\n}}
{{As they quietly severed their relationship there are details the fact-checkers want to keep from getting out.\nIt bears all the earmarks of Hollywood nuptials. The announced pairing was trumpeted in the press, PR notices fired all over, and warm projections of a blossoming relationship were headlined. Then as the union finally crumbles a curt request to respect their privacy at this time is barely dashed off. This being a media affair that dissolved is the only difference.\nIt was late on a Friday, during the noted document-dump time frame, that the announcement came that Snopes, the famed verification website, was pulling out of its agreement with Facebook. Following the 2016 Presidential election, to much media fanfare, Snopes had joined in on the highly touted venture started by the social media titan to get control over \u201cfake news\u201d on its platform. The results of that effort have been judged to be MOSTLY MIXED.\nNow two years later that effort at correcting false narratives, purging fake stories, and dealing with the troll-like nature of coordinated propaganda is appearing to be a miasma of misinformation. A number of those who participated have expressed their problems in working with FB and the flawed nature of the platform to police the news narrative.\nA Flickering Interrogation Lamp\nWhen the announcement came out earlier this month it was not made immediately clear why Snopes was electing to leave the project. At the time of the announcement Facebook had gathered together near 40 journalism outlets worldwide to work on the news verification initiative. All seemed to be operating as Facebook intended, and the statement from Snopes was not immediately clear.\nCalling the decision \u201cA difficult, but necessary change for Snopes in 2019,\u201d the official comment from the site hinted at the issue. \u201cAt this time we are evaluating the ramifications and costs of providing third-party fact-checking services, and we want to determine with certainty that our efforts to aid any particular platform are a net positive for our online community, publication, and staff.\u201d\nIt does end up being revealed that financial considerations were behind the decision, but it also appears to have been rooted in a questionable arrangement for the site at the start. As revealed in the official comment, when they set up the partnership in 2016 Snopes \u201cvolunteered\u201d initially to enter into the exploratory fact-checking effort, with no offer of payment. Eventually a compensation with Facebook was reached, and the site was paid $100,000 over the course of 2017.\nHowever since then internal concerns over the partnership, and how it was affecting Snopes as an entity were rising. The verification work became a labor intensive process that favored FB over Snopes. Due to the mounting work struggles a managing editor and a fact-checker left over the FB arrangement. Snopes ended its work at the end of its contract in December, and spent January trying to renegotiate for a better system. That recent announcement indicated no agreement could be reached.\nThe initial problem is the process that FB has in place means selected work originates with its own internal algorithm. First a potential story becomes flagged by the FB program and it is then sent out to the fact-checkers to verify. They in turn have to work on the piece and manually enter it into the FB interface. Not only does this constitute added work but that algorithm does not differentiate the source.\nPieces sent to fact-checkers are not predetermined to be news stories with errors, stories containing factual inaccuracies, pieces originating from satirical or humor websites, or those created as outright fabrication. This lack of determination created a backlash for Snopes. At times the workers were \u201cdebunking\u201d stories that were from clear satirical outlets, and this would lead to commenters mocking them for taking things seriously that were never intended to be regarded that way.\nThis unnecessary work combined with the laborious entry procedure meant that the slim 16 person fact-checking squad at Snopes found itself stretched thin. It was increasingly difficult to keep up with the FB demands, all while still operating its site and generating its own content. That workload with a minimal amount of return for the effort meant Snopes found itself in an untenable spot.\nOnly The Facts They Deem Fit To Print\nIn December, weeks prior to the ending of the Snopes contract term, The Guardian spoke with Brooke Binkowski, that managing editor who departed Snopes over the Facebook issues. Beyond just an overtaxed workforce she cited a number of systemic issues with the FB fact-check initiative.\nOne primary issue is that the social media site is less focused on its application of fact-checking than it is being perceived as doing the needed work. According to Binkowski, the purpose of the verification program was to serve as a PR tool \u2013 and possibly a means of deflecting responsibility. \u201cThey are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck \u2026 They clearly don\u2019t care.\u201d This view echoed words from another fact-checker, made a year earlier. \u201cThey think of us as doing their work for them. They have a big problem, and they are leaning on other organizations to clean up after them.\u201d\nThese perceptions hold up when coupled with previously reported stories on the effectiveness of the work initiative. One problem is that the news gatherers are not being given data to show them results of their efforts, which would give them tools to allow them to modify and improve their methodology. As another worker noted, while they are furiously working blind the fake stories were still going viral.\nOne other study found that tagging a news item as \u201cunverified\u201d by outside press sources had little to no influence on consumers. The Yale University study found that flagging news items as \u201cfalse\u201d only impacted a reader\u2019s perception by a few percentage points. Further, the presence of them flagging what was only a small fraction of stories lent more heft to those stories not addressed; if readers saw there was no \u201cfalse\u201d designation it was more likely to be held as truthful, even if no peer review took place.\nBinkowski even alluded to another tactic Facebook may have been resorting to that skewed the effectiveness of fact-checking even more \u2014 targeted results. She states that she saw what appeared to be an effort by FB to steer the fact-checkers to focus on stories that would have an effect on its advertisers. When it comes to debunking reports that had a negative impact on promotional partners this alters the perception of the work. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing journalism any more. You\u2019re doing propaganda,\u201d said Binkowski.\nThe Snopes CEO David Mikkelson disputes this claim, dismissing that it is the view of a former employee, and one who was not involved in daily work of that nature. However it does have the tone of someone trying himself to debunk what he wants to declare \u201cfake\u201d content. Mikkelson has stated they left the possibility open to renegotiate a deal with the Facebook mavens.\nAs more digital news providers are coming under financial strain it stands to reason he would be interested in bringing back those lost revenues to Snopes. Linking this desire, with Facebook seeming to be driving its verification based on profit, and you have the potential for more \u201cfake\u201d problems. That profit motive puts the machinations in place to create a falsified news narrative, rather the means to combat such.\n}}

{{The D.C. branch of the ACLU is helping three anti-Trump activists fight what they say is an overly broad government demand for their personal Facebook data.\nIn \u201cmotion to quash\u201d court documents filed this month, ACLU lawyers argue that letting federal investigators comb through the contents of individual Facebook pages amounts to an unjustified and unconstitutional invasion of privacy.\nThe motion concerns an ongoing case in which the DOJ has been seeking information related to protests and rioting during the January 20 inauguration of President Trump. Despite the fact that the case has been going on for months, the activists only recently learned that Uncle Sam is interested in their Facebook data. While Facebook typically tells users about government warrants, a gag order initially prohibited it from doing so in this case. Facebook challenged that order and the government ultimately agreed to allow it to disclose the warrants.\nThe three warrants require Facebook to disclose the entire contents of three Facebook accounts for a period of more than 90 days\u2013a huge swath of information the ACLU says would include everything from intimate communications and chat messages to family photos and religious affiliations.

{{SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. government is trying to force Facebook Inc (FB.O) to break the encryption in its popular Messenger app so law enforcement may listen to a suspect\u2019s voice conversations in a criminal probe, three people briefed on the case said, resurrecting the issue of whether companies can be compelled to alter their products to enable surveillance.\nAttendees walk past a Facebook Messenger logo during Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\nThe previously unreported case in a federal court in California is proceeding under seal, so no filings are publicly available, but the three people told Reuters that Facebook is contesting the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s demand.\nThe judge in the Messenger case heard arguments on Tuesday on a government motion to hold Facebook in contempt of court for refusing to carry out the surveillance request, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nFacebook and the Department of Justice declined to comment.\nThe Messenger issue arose in Fresno, California, as part of an investigation of the MS-13 gang, one of the people said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump frequently uses the gang, which is active in the United States and Central America, as a symbol of lax U.S. immigration policy and a reason to attack so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d laws preventing police from detaining people solely to enforce immigration law.\nTrump called members of the gang \u201canimals\u201d this year when the Sheriff of Fresno County complained that California laws limited her co-operation with federal immigration enforcement targeting gang members.\nThe potential impact of the judge\u2019s coming ruling is unclear. If the government prevails in the Facebook Messenger case, it could make similar arguments to force companies to rewrite other popular encrypted services such as Signal and Facebook\u2019s billion-user WhatsApp, which include both voice and text functions, some legal experts said.\nLaw enforcement agencies forcing technology providers to rewrite software to capture and hand over data that is no longer encrypted would have major implications for the companies which see themselves as defenders of individual privacy while under pressure from police and lawmakers.\nSimilar issues came into play during a legal fight in 2016 between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over access to an iPhone owned by a slain sympathizer of Islamic State in San Bernardino, California, who had murdered county employees.\nWIRETAP OF VOICE CONVERSATIONS\nIn the Apple case the company argued that the government could not compel it to create software to breach the phone without violating the company\u2019s First Amendment speech and expression rights. The government dropped the litigation after investigators got into the phone with a contractor\u2019s help.\nUnlike the San Bernardino case, where the FBI wanted to crack one iPhone in its possession, prosecutors are seeking a wiretap of ongoing voice conversations by one person on Facebook Messenger.\nFacebook is arguing in court that Messenger voice calls are encrypted end-to-end, meaning that only the two parties have access to the conversation, two of the people briefed on the case said.\nOrdinary Facebook text messages, Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Gmail, and other services are decrypted by the service providers during transit for targeted advertising or other reasons, making them available for court-ordered interception.\nEnd-to-end encrypted communications, by contrast, go directly from one user to another user without revealing anything intelligible to providers.\nFacebook says it can only comply with the government\u2019s request if it rewrites the code relied upon by all its users to remove encryption or else hacks the government\u2019s current target, according to the sources.\nLegal experts differed about whether the government would likely be able to force Facebook to comply.\nStephen Larson, a former judge and federal prosecutor who represented San Bernardino victims, said the government must meet a high legal standard when seeking to obtain phone conversations, including showing there was no other way to obtain the evidence.\nStill, the U.S. Constitution allows for reasonable searches, Larson said, and if those standards are met, then companies should not be able to stand in the way.\nA federal appeals court in Washington D.C. ruled in 2006 that the law forcing telephone companies to enable police eavesdropping also applies to some large providers of Voice over Internet Protocol, including cable and other broadband carriers servicing homes. VoIP enables voice calls online rather than by traditional circuit transmission.\nHowever, in cases of chat, gaming, or other internet services that are not tightly integrated with existing phone infrastructure, such as Google Hangouts, Signal and Facebook Messenger, federal regulators have not attempted to extend the eavesdropping law to cover them, said Al Gidari, a director of privacy at Stanford University Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society.\n\u201cA messaging platform is excluded,\u201d maintains Gidari, who is not involved in the Fresno case.\n}}
{{Wildfire, the social media startup that\u2019s making huge strides in online marketing \u2014 Facebook marketing in particular \u2014 has just been snapped up by Google for an undisclosed price.\n(Web rumors peg the deal at $250 million; however, a Google rep confirmed that the deal is not coming under regulatory review, so the dollar amount is not, by Google\u2019s standards at least, significant.)\nNice work, Google! Picking up one of the main marketing channels to a major competitor right as that competitor\u2019s marketing effectiveness is coming under fire \u2014 that\u2019s some Spy Versus Spy business right there.\nAlso, the deal likely gives Google some inside-horse access to very interesting Facebook marketing data. (If we were Facebook, for that reason alone, we\u2019d cut off Wildfire\u2019s API access faster than you could say, \u201cHey! Don\u2019t look at that!\u201d Officially, though, Facebook is not commenting on the deal.)\nThe Google party line is that the company wants to own (and eventually integrate) the online marketing experience, full stop. It wants to have a single destination where a brand marketing manager can go to create and control all online campaigns, from search marketing to Twitter CRM to Facebook campaigns, the whole shebang.\nIf you talk to a Google rep, you\u2019ll hear that this isn\u2019t about controlling a key Facebook marketing platform per se, and it\u2019s not about the fact that Facebook now leads Google in its overall share of display advertising per se. It\u2019s just that Google wants to be online marketing. Everywhere, and to everyone, including Facebook- and Twitter-using brand marketers (and let\u2019s not forget that Google has a testy relationship with Twitter, as well, due to mutual disagreements over social search and who\u2019s indexing whom).\nIf this is the case, we\u2019d expect to see a comprehensive ad management platform for the entire web emerging from the bowels of Google within the next six to 12 months. For now, Wildfire will continue to operate as-is, a standalone social marketing shop.\nPotential conflicts of interest aside, we read on the official Google blog, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to share that the Wildfire team will be joining Google. \u2026 With Wildfire, we\u2019re looking forward to creating new opportunities for our clients to engage with people across all social services. We believe that better content and more seamless solutions will help unlock the full potential of the web for people and businesses.\u201d\nThat last sentence is a goulash of buzzwords, but in short, Google is promising that Wildfire\u2019s offering will not lose its diversity of services. Still, we have some serious doubts about how good this deal will ultimately be for Wildfire\u2019s continued growth.\nWe did an in-depth tour and interview session at Wildfire a few weeks ago, just before the startup launched its Suite 2.0 marketing tools. At that time, Wildfire co-founder and CEO Victoria Ransom (pictured at top) told us that Facebook was hands-down the company\u2019s largest area of focus. In fact, Wildfire got its start making turnkey sweepstakes apps for brands to use on Facebook.\nAs for Google+, Ransom said marketers weren\u2019t as interested due to the (real or perceived) lack of richness in content and interaction on the newer social network.\nWe\u2019re waiting to hear back from Wildfire and Google now and will update this post as soon as more details are available.\n}}
{{News flash: People don\u2019t like it when apps post Facebook updates on their behalf. As Facebook continues to clean up the news feed , the social giant said Tuesday that it will begin deprioritizing \u201cimplicit stories\u201d that are automatically posted by third parties.\nOverall, the company said implicit stories see lower levels of engagement, compared with stories explicitly shared by users. \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard that people often feel surprised or confused by stories that are shared without taking an explicit action,\u201d the social network said in a blog post.\nFacebook said the number of implicit stories has dropped in the past year, but it will tweak its algorithm to prioritize explicitly shared stories in the coming months. In addition, it is encouraging developers to consider other channels to engage users, including Open Graph, Messenger, and the share and like buttons.\nLately, the social network has been taking aim at news feed spam. At the beginning of the year, it debuted Paper, a stripped-down news reader app to cut through the clutter. It\u2019s also working to demote updates with link bait\u2013updates that ask users to like, comment, or share\u2013and spammy links that trick people into clicking.\n}}
{{By Tony Romm | The Washington Post\nFacebook on Friday revealed that a major software bug may have allowed third-party apps to wrongly access the photos of up to 6.8 million users, including images that people began uploading to the site but didn\u2019t post publicly.\nThe mishap, which occurred over a 12-day period in September, adds to Facebook\u2019s mounting privacy headaches after incidents earlier this year in which it failed to fully safeguard the personal data of its users.\nBecause of a bug, about 1,500 apps could access \u201ca broader set of photos than usual,\u201d Facebook explained in a blog post. In general, Facebook allows apps by third-party developers to access photos shared on a user\u2019s timeline. But the bug may have allowed developers to access photos on Marketplace, a Facebook hub for users to buy and sell goods, and some posted in Stories, where users can share short photo or video updates that appear for 24 hours.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry this happened,\u201d Facebook said in its blog post. \u201cEarly next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug. We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.\u201d\n}}
{{\u201cIt\u2019s as if there\u2019s a national script we have learned,\u201d said Stephen Colbert, the host of CBS\u2019s Late Show, in a somber monologue Monday night. \u201cAnd I think by accepting the script, we tacitly accept that the script will end the same way every time, with nothing changing.\u201d Instead, he argued, Americans must have the courage to act.\nAnd do what, exactly?\n\u201cI call my representatives and senators every time this happens. I email them. I sign every petition until I am unsure [of] which ones I have or haven't signed,\u201d Brian Riester, a Facebook friend, wrote in a status update this week. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next step? Can anyone at all share how I can lessen the ability of a person to effortlessly kill dozens of other people? I am sincerely interested to know everything I should be doing.\u201d\nRiester touched on some of the common wisdom. Citizens are told to make their voices heard. Call your lawmaker. Make sure you vote. But he also touched on the sense of frustration among those who have done these things and see nothing change. In an era in which people find and respond to news of mass shootings largely online, it\u2019s not clear how much, if anything, can be accomplished by the now-typical responses to gun violence among those who want stricter laws. Signing online petitions and tweeting to members of Congress doesn\u2019t seem to reduce gun violence any more than voting does.\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s involved with social change has to consider what levers they're trying to pull to accomplish the change,\u201d said Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media. \u201cMost of us have been taught to pull the legal lever\u2014passing laws, electing people to enforce them. Social media is particularly strong at pulling the norms lever\u2014trying to change public attitudes on key issues.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hard with gun control,\u201d he added, \u201cis that there\u2019s such a deep split on norms that it seems unlikely that a social media campaign is going to change minds. And our legislative system\u2014paralyzed on so many issues\u2014feels utterly unlikely to make a move regarding gun control... It\u2019s not that online activism never works. Unfortunately, this may be a space where online activism isn't as effective as we'd like.\u201d\nOr maybe it\u2019s too soon to say. That could be in part because the anti-gun-violence movement is startlingly new. While the NRA\u2019s messaging\u2014don\u2019t take our guns!\u2014has been ingrained in American culture for decades, the other side isn\u2019t even a decade old. Past coalitions, from an era when people talked about \u201cgun control\u201d instead of \u201cgun safety\u201d mostly dissolved after Brady bill efforts in the early 1990s, and the grassroots movement to enact tougher gun laws today is only just emerging. Advocates are focused on goals like banning gun sales and gun possession among people convicted of violent hate crimes, prohibiting suspected terrorists from buying guns, and requiring background checks for every gun sale in the United States. The movement\u2019s nascence, many advocates say, is a cause for hope.\n}}
{{Facebook has announced that it will expand its Facebook Credits system across the site.\nFacebook says that this step will help to expand its microtransaction features into more apps. In a blog post, Facebook Product Marketer Deborah Liu said that, \u201cThis new option is live in a few applications to a small percentage of users, and will roll out more broadly over the coming weeks.\u201d\nThis widening of the Facebook Credits program represents Facebook\u2019s desire to take their cut of the booming microtransaction market on their site.\nWith the advent of Facebook applications, companies such as Zynga and Playfish have included in-game downloadables in their applications as a major source of revenue. These transactions, which often allow gamers to advance in gameplay, are priced low enough to be in impulse-buy territory for most consumers.\nThe initial problem with these transactions is that there wasn\u2019t a consistent currency across applications. Therefore, if you wanted to buy downloadables in Farmville and Mafia Wars, you had to enter your credit card or Paypal information twice. With the Facebook Credits system, there\u2019s one currency that works with Farmville, Gifts, Restaurant City and Mafia Wars, among others.\nThe system is also a huge boon for Facebook. Liu said that Facebook is currently taking a 30% cut of the microtransactions. In addition, Liu\u2019s post cited statistics saying that Facebook Credits users were significantly more likely to buy downloadables than users paying with credit cards, likely because of the Credits system\u2019s ease of use.\nBroadening this business model across the site will only help Facebook\u2019s bottom line. As the company\u2019s user base continues to grow, the Facebook Credits system should ensure a steady revenue base for at least the immediate future.\nRead next: Facebook Just Patented The Feed - What Does That Mean For Everyone That Uses Them?\n}}
{{Older people are almost four times more likely to have shared fake news on Facebook than the younger generation, according to research published in the journal Science.\nOn average, American Facebook users over 65 shared nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains as those aged between 18 and 29, researchers from NYU and Princeton found in the study, which also concluded sharing such false content was \u201ca relatively rare activity\u201d.\nThe researchers analysed the Facebook history of about 1,750 American adults, cross-referencing links they had posted with lists of fake news publishers. In doing so, they found the vast majority of users did not share any articles from fake news domains in 2016 \u2013 8.5% of those in the study as a whole shared at least one link to a domain such as denverguardian.com, truepundit.com, or donaldtrumpnews.co.\nThese sites, and 18 others like them, made up the list of \u201cintentionally or systematically factually inaccurate\u201d stories the researchers defined as fake news. Sites that are \u201cpartisan or hyperpartisan\u201d, such as the far-right Breitbart.com, were excluded from the list of fake news purveyors.\nBut of those who shared links from the 21 \u201cmostly pro-Donald Trump\u201d domains the researchers looked at, there were clear demographic differences.\nEighteen per cent of Republican users shared at least one link to a fake news site, compared with less than 4% of Democrats. The more conservative a user was, the more articles they shared \u2013 a finding attributed to the fact that fake news in 2016 was mostly pro-Trump, and \u201cthe tendency of respondents to share articles they agree with\u201d.\nThose who shared the most content in general were less likely to share fake news, suggesting the problem is not that some people \u201cwill share anything\u201d, the paper said. Instead, people who share a large number of links are more media-savvy, and able to distinguish real from fake online.\nThat findings are backed up by the demographic data: over-65s, who came to the internet later in life, shared more than twice as many fake news articles as those in the second-oldest age group, even when controlling for ideology, education and the total number of links shared.\nThe authors wrote: \u201cAs the largest generation in America enters retirement at a time of sweeping demographic and technological change, it is possible that an entire cohort of Americans, now in their 60s and beyond, lacks the level of digital media literacy necessary to reliably determine the trustworthiness of news encountered online.\n\u201cWithin this cohort, lower levels of digital literacy could be compounded by the tendency to use social endorsements as credibility cues. If true, this would imply a growing impact, as more Americans from older age groups join online social communities.\u201d\nA second possibility, they noted, is that the findings are a specific case of the general effect of ageing on memory. \u201cMemory deteriorates with age in a way that particularly undermines resistance to \u2018illusions of truth\u2019,\u201d the authors wrote.\n}}

{{Mark Zuckerberg told some staffers at Facebook earlier this year that the company was at war. Photo: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images\nEverything at Facebook is definitely fine and nobody, least of all CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is worried at all. Because when things are fine and you are not worried the logical thing to do is to put 50 of your most-trusted staffers in a room and declare that your company is at war.\nFrom the Wall Street Journal:\nMark Zuckerberg gathered roughly 50 of his top lieutenants earlier this year and told them that Facebook Inc. was at war and he planned to lead the company accordingly.\nDuring times of peace, executives can move more slowly and ensure that everybody is on board with key decisions, he said during the June meeting, according to people familiar with the remarks. But with Facebook under siege from lawmakers, investors and angry users, he needed to act more decisively, the people said.\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement, along with other behavior, the Journal also reports, has led to increased clashes with COO Sheryl Sandberg, who reportedly feared for her job after Zuckerberg was displeased with the way Facebook handled itself in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He also reportedly clashed with Instagram co-founders Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom, who left the company in September citing a search for new creative projects. Brian Acton and Jan Koum, the co-founders of WhatsApp, left amid what were apparently similarly tense relations with Zuckerberg.\nThe Journal\u2019s piece comes on the heels of another deeply reported piece from the New York Times earlier this month, which detailed the chaos and dysfunction Facebook has been operating under internally for months. The piece noted that Facebook had hired Definers Public Affairs, a Republican political-consulting firm, to conduct \u201ccampaign-style opposition research,\u201d a.k.a. publishing and widely sharing news pieces that made Facebook\u2019s critics look bad. The piece, unsurprisingly, immediately garnered a hell of a lot of bad press for Facebook. During a meeting at Facebook with staff on Friday, a source told the Journal that Zuckerberg called this \u201cbullshit.\u201d Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s former head of global policy and communications who remains at the company, said at this meeting that Facebook should expect more, similarly bad press in the coming weeks.

Lamebook said its name did not infringe Facebook\u2019s trademarks and the name was an obvious parody, making it protected by the First Amendment.\nFour days later, lawyers for Facebook sued Lamebook for trademark infringement in federal court in San Jose. Facebook tried and failed to have Lamebook\u2019s suit in Austin (the Western District) transferred to the Northern District of Texas. Perhaps that\u2019s because Austin is a tech-friendly town with a strong entrepreneurial spirit?\nFacebook dismissed the San Jose suit in June without prejudice, which means the case was dismissed but could be refiled in the future, and then filed counterclaims against Lamebook in the Austin suit. That\u2019s the suit that was settled on the 25th.\nDizzy, yet? If not, there\u2019s more. Facebook lawsuits against FacebookOfSex.com and Faceporn.com both continue in federal courts.\n}}

If you select this feature, other users will not be able to download, share or send your photo in a Facebook message. Also, people you are not friends with on the net will not be able to tag anyone, including themselves, in your profile photo.

{{SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s chief product officer and one of its earliest employees, Chris Cox, said on Thursday he is leaving the company just days after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed a plan to transform the world\u2019s biggest social network into an encryption-focused messaging company.\nCox, the 36-year-old Zuckerberg lieutenant who would have managed the CEO\u2019s vision to bring Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp closer together, said in a blog post that his departure came \u201cwith great sadness.\u201d He had left a graduate program at Stanford University to join Facebook in 2005 as a software engineer and helped developed its original news feed feature.\n\u201cAs Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network ... This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,\u201d Cox said in a Facebook post.\nCox\u2019s departure removes a layer of management, bringing Zuckerberg closer to a family of apps that he wants to make compatible, in what technology analysts expect will be a complicated engineering task.\nShares of Facebook were down 1.7 percent in extended trading following the announcement.\nCox informed the company of his intention to resign on Monday, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.\nAlso departing is WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels, adding to a string of recent high-profile exits from Facebook\u2019s product and communications teams. The shakeup is the second major management restructuring in as many years as the company also faces numerous government investigations across the world related to user privacy and fake news on its services.\nDaniels had informed the company several months ago of his intention to leave and will stay on through a leadership transition, a person familiar with the matter said.\nZuckerberg told Wired magazine on March 6 that \u201cthere will be a bunch of work inside the company to make sure that we have the right folks in the right roles\u201d to bring Facebook\u2019s apps together and introduce more privacy features.\nEMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg said that \u201cwhenever there is a shift in strategy, it\u2019s not unusual to see some personnel changes.\u201d\nNEW STRUCTURE\nWill Cathcart, vice president of product management, will now lead WhatsApp, and Head of Video, Games and Monetization Fidji Simo will be the new head of the Facebook app, Zuckerberg said.\nCathcart and Simo worked closely to bring video uploading tools and professional video content to Facebook. And growing viewership and advertising on videos are of growing importance to both the Facebook and WhatsApp apps.\nThe company does not immediately plan to fill Cox\u2019s role, Zuckerberg said, adding that Cathcart, Simo and the heads of Instagram and Messenger will now report directly to him.\nFacebook\u2019s family of apps strategy has so far been led jointly by Cox and Javier Olivan, vice president of growth.\nZuckerberg said on Thursday that Olivan will now lead the effort to integrate Facebook apps, a key move as the company encrypts conversations on more of its messaging services and makes them compatible.\nCox gained greater oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram following the exits of their founders over the last two years. He also remained a key figure at Facebook, where for years until Monday he spoke at the orientations for new employees.\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox speaks at Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S. May 1, 2018.

For ones that leave sellers with more profit, try eBid, Etsy, Gumtree, Preloved and craigslist.\n'SPRING CLEANING WILL HELP PAY FOR MY HONEYMOON' Vicky Robinson has turned spring-cleaning her clutter into an all-year-round art form. The public relations executive even writes a blog on the subject, called Saver in the City. Although eBay is a popular option for selling, she prefers to use it only for higher value goods. For lower value items she is now sold on Facebook as a way of offloading her unwanted clutter. Vicky, 27, says: \u2018I love eBay but it can be expensive because you have to pay eBay and then there are the charges for using PayPal plus the hassle of posting items. \u2018Sometimes, the postage has turned out to be far more than I\u2019ve charged the buyer.\u2019 Vicky, from Dartford in Kent, says: \u2018There are selling pages on Facebook where you can sell unwanted items without hassle and hefty fees. I found a local one, solely for people who live in my area. All you need to do is post details of an item on the page, add how much you want for it and include a photo or two. The buyer will then arrange the pick-up.\u2019 She always meets in a safe public space when giving items to buyers \u2013 never at home. She adds: \u2018I started using Facebook in August last year and so far I\u2019ve made \u00a3810.\u2019 Vicky recently stepped up her selling activities in readiness for her wedding in October to Tom, who works in visual effects for the film industry. She says: \u2018My target is to save \u00a31,500 for the honeymoon as we want to travel the length of the US West Coast. We have planned a three- week adventure that will include a road trip from San Francisco to San Diego.\u2019 Vicky has been selling everything from unwanted bubble baths left over from Christmas for \u00a35; boxes of table quizzes for \u00a31; to a pair of Ugg boots for \u00a340. She says: \u2018My mum always said you\u2019d be amazed how quickly pounds pile up and she\u2019s right, even if you only sell something for \u00a31.\u2019\nMOBILES AND GADGETS\nFind out the potential value of old phones by using websites such as Phones4Cash or SellMyMobile \u2013 and then approach specialist companies prepared to buy them.\nThese include MoneyForYourPhone, TopDollarMobile and Zapper.\nZapper has an app that lets sellers scan items for immediate valuation. Buyers send off the goods and get cash by return.\nYou need to be careful as some companies want only relatively new \u2018old\u2019 tech while others may not pay as much as you expect.\nOld cameras can be sold through website CameraJungle. It provides a quote on the item and the seller either posts it or pays \u00a36.99 for the company to collect.\nBooks and films command low prices online but selling this way is an easy way to declutter\nBOOKS, GAMES AND DVDS\nBooks and films command low prices online but selling this way is an easy way to declutter.\nFor example, Ziffit lets sellers enter a book ISBN or use its app to scan a barcode to get a quote.\nYou can then choose to receive payment by bank transfer or PayPal \u2013 or opt to give the cash to charity.\nAlthough postage costs will eat into profits some websites send prepaid postage bags. Other dealers include WeBuyBooks, momox and musicMagpie.\nCLOTHING\nIf selling online seems too much hassle, then consider contacting the Clothes Bank.\nThe company pays \u00a35 for every 10kg bag of unwanted \u2018quality\u2019 clothing \u2013 and will even pick it up from your home and pay cash on the spot.\nAlternatively, you might try \u2018swishing\u2019 \u2013 arranging parties where the guests swap their unwanted clothes for free.\nFor more details visit swishing.co.uk.\nCHARITABLE GIVING\nWhen clearing clutter is more important than cash, consider giving away unwanted items \u2013 including clothing. List them on the website freecycle, a huge marketplace where all items are donated.\nAlternatively, take old clothes to shops that have signed up to recycling schemes. Marks & Spencer coined the term Shwopping \u2013 bringing an old item of clothing into an M&S store when shopping for something new. The clothing goes to the charity Oxfam to sell or recycle.\nTK Maxx has a similar initiative supporting Cancer Research. Monsoon customers bringing in unwanted items from its stores get \u00a310 off new purchases over \u00a350 \u2013 and the unwanted items are either given to charity or recycled with profits helping disabled children.\nCar boot sale: A pitch typically costs between \u00a320 and \u00a325\nCAR BOOT SALES\nThe traditional car boot sale is still an effective way of selling items. A pitch typically costs between \u00a320 and \u00a325. A list of events and locations can be found at websites carbootcalendar and carbootjunction.\nIf standing in a field or car park for hours does not appeal, consider listing your unwanted items on the virtual bootsale website Shpock. It is free to use with no listing or transaction fees.\nLike a real boot sale, it is aimed at people dealing with locals, so transactions can be face-to-face with payment in cash. Sellers can also agree to deliver goods and accept payment through PayPal.\nDECLUTTERING DAY\nAn entire industry has grown out of the demand for decluttering and there is even an organisation called The Association of Professional Declutterers & Organisers, which backs National Clear Your Clutter Day.\nIt was held last month but do not fret that you missed it \u2013 every day is a potential decluttering day.\n}}
{{Eighteen Asia Pacific banks are working with MasterCard on the initiative which had a test run in Australia when MasterCard offered key customers Justin Timberlake related offers to coincide with the singer's tour which concludes in Perth this week. Appetite for such targeted offers is on the rise. In its latest Digital Shopper Relevancy survey, released last week, CapGemini found that 54 per cent of online shoppers want personalised shopping offers; 61 per cent want online stores to remember them to speed up shopping; and in developing markets consumers are keen to use social media to research purchases prior to buying \u2013 which is precisely the insight that MasterCard is looking to tap with its Priceless Engine. Facebook Australia sought to clarify the company's position on Tuesday, saying no information on individual users was sold to advertisers. \"We applaud what Mastercard is doing with their 'Priceless Engine' but, to clarify, we are not providing them, or any other company, personal data of Facebook users. We are working with them to create targeting clusters using Custom Audiences \u2014 a tool that matches anonymised data from Facebook with their own anonymised data for optimising ad delivery on Facebook to their users,\" a company spokeswoman said. She said Facebook works with many clients in similar fashion with compelling results. \"What Mastercard is doing is a really smart way to do marketing,\" she said.\nAustralia's big banks already analyse their own data reserves in order to develop customer-specific banking products and services. The MasterCard arrangement will let them leverage even broader reserves of data in order to drive online payments and take another slice of the online action. Dr Ian Opperman, chief executive of Sirca, a not-for-profit organisation established by a consortium of Australian and New Zealand universities to conduct financial sector research and innovation, explained why big data is such a hot topic for banks. Speaking at a big data seminar organised by the Centre for International Finance and Regulation (CIFR) last week, Opperman noted that \"everything can be digitised and everything digitised can be used to make money.\" Progress is, however, patchy. Technology analyst Gartner surveyed 302 of its international Research Circle members to find that 73 per cent have invested or plan to invest in big data initiatives by June 2016, up from 64 per cent a year ago, but few have progressed much beyond the pilot stage. Maria Garcia de la Banda, deputy dean of the IT Faculty at Monash University, which last week held a big data forum attracting speakers from pioneers such as Walmart, IBM and Telstra, said there were three stages in big data application \u2013 first when organisations started collecting data and issuing alerts, second when they started performing analysis, and finally the \"age of discovery\" where organisations used big data to support evidence-based decision making, asset management or testing.\nAustralia's big banks, she said, were now at the stage of \"data enrichment \u2026 putting their data together with social media, with data about geographical location and that gives them an enormous amount of influence.\" Issues still holding back the financial sector's progress with big data is poor data quality, data hoarding by individual departments, lack of standardisation and access to skills, although Professor de la Banda said that universities had a wealth of data analytics capabilities and that from next year Monash would be offering a Masters in data science. The challenge of managing data quality and standards was highlighted by CIFR research fellow Dr Kingsley Jones who said that a survey of one financial registry had uncovered 140 different ways to describe a single corporate entity \u2013 making it impossible to properly analyse the data associated with that entity. The funds management sector was singled out for having particularly poor data. Michael Berg, a senior consultant with Rice Warner which provides analysis services to the wealth management sector, said its Super Insights study had taken data from 18 funds and 10 million records in order to help the funds benchmark their performance and identify growth opportunities. That uncovered a swathe of data quality and standards issues. For example, 14 different data formats were used across the 18 funds which needed sorting out.\nSome of the underlying data quality was also questionable, he said, pointing to superannuation records which were clearly errors.

{{Remember when Facebook changed all of our default email accounts to their own, unused system, without informing any of us? That was fun! But it looks like the problem could be much wider and more damaging than it first seemed.\nCNET reports a multitude of user complaints after the big obnoxious switch-over, citing claims that Facebook is \"changing their address books while intercepting and losing unknown amounts of email\". Some Facebookers are seeing messages (inadvertently) sent to their @facebook accounts vanishing into nothing, while others have noticed every email address in their phone overwritten by Facebook:\nThis morning my mother was complaining that many of the email addresses in her Droid Razr contacts had been replaced with Facebook ones. It would seem the Facebook app had been populating her address book with emails and contact photos, and decided to migrate all her Facebook-using contacts over to this convenient new system. That seems like a much greater controversy to me than Facebook hiding people's email addresses.\nThose things both suck and are a bigger attention-grab than merely changing a default inbox. It's much harder to reverse too \u2014 if Facebook wiped out all of your friends' email addresses, tracking them down and entering them all over again would be a serious travail. There's an enormous difference between having an annoying email account you don't want put on your Facebook profile, and having that annoying email address permanently erase other email addresses.\nPersonally, I've noticed some Facebook strangeness on my iPhone's contact list. For many of my friends (there doesn't seem to be a pattern), there's now a second, duplicate contact with nothing but Facebook information (usually just their Facebook email address). This is annoying in that there are now doubles for a lot of people I talk to, but when I try dialling their number, I get the bizarre caller ID text above. Whether this is an iOS 6 Facebook integration quirk, a Facebook screwup, or some sort of screwup collaboration between Apple and Facebook remains to be seen. We've reached out to Facebook for a comment on all this and will let you know if Emailgate is really as bad as it looks. In the meantime, the only defence you've got is preventive \u2014 deleting Facebook from your phone and turning off Facebook integration is probably the only way to avoid this fate. [CNET]\nUpdate: Gizmodo reader Daniel's problem suggets iOS 6 is making Facebook's email blitz even worse:\nI recently updated my iPhone to iOS 6 beta, which has Facebook integration. Since Facebook changed the email addresses on contacts, I've actually lost every single one of my email addresses including those for work. Emails to my boss have gone unanswered as they've been going to his Facebook! Driven me insane and absolutely horrid move for Facebook. Very much regretting wishing for this whole Facebook integration thing now!\nGranted, it's still beta software.\nUpdate 2: Facebook knows this is a problem.

For the wedding, they had a band, the Leftover Cuties, playing by the pool. There also was a DJ, and the party went late.\n'There were activities all weekend.

{{Uber has brought on Daniel Danker to serve as a senior director and head of driver product. Prior to joining Uber, he was a product director at Facebook responsible for video and Facebook Live.\n\u201cDrivers are the heart of the Uber experience, and Daniel\u2019s passion for our mission and deep product knowledge will ensure we continue to improve and innovate on their behalf,\u201d Uber Head of Product Manik Gupta said in a statement to TechCrunch.\nUber has been without a head of driver product since December, when Aaron Schildkrout left shortly after Uber wrapped up its 180 days of change driver campaign. As head of driver product, Danker will be responsible for planning, strategy and execution. Danker has had a long history in Silicon Valley. Between 2000 and 2010, Danker worked in a couple of roles at Microsoft, where he ended his stint as director of development and operations. He eventually left Microsoft for BBC in 2010 and then made his way to Shazam, where he served as chief product officer for nearly three years.\nDanker\u2019s addition to the team comes in lockstep with Uber Chief Brand Officer Bozoma Saint John\u2019s impending departure. This hire also comes a couple of months after Uber unveiled its revamped driver app. The new app was designed to make it easier for drivers to access pertinent information, while ensuring they wouldn\u2019t be distracted behind the wheel. One key added feature was the ability for drivers to recognize where surge, boost and incentivized areas are located.\n\u201cSay you\u2019re in a slow area,\u201d Uber Driver Experience Group Manager Yuhki Yamashita told me in April. \u201cWe might actually suggest a place to go to instead because it\u2019s much busier. And in this way you get a little bit more information about what\u2019s happening around you.

Its commitment to drivers kicked off in June with Uber\u2019s 180 days of change. In that time, Uber added in-app tipping and a number of other features. At the Code Conference last month, Khosrowshahi said despite what former CEO Travis Kalanick said, Uber will never get rid of the driver.\n\u201cThe face of Uber is the person sitting in the front seat,\u201d Khosrowshahi said.\nHe also spoke about how Uber is looking for ways to offer benefits and insurance to its drivers.\n}}

{{Facebook continues its challenge to Amazon\u2019s Twitch streaming service today with new features that center on its growing its community of livestreamers. At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, the social network is announcing direct livestreaming from PC games to Facebook and in-game rewards for livestream spectators.\nThis push for more streaming features falls under Facebook\u2019s ongoing focus to make it easier for developers to integrate video sharing features directly into their games and to make livestreaming accessible for more players.\nAt GDC, Facebook is releasing a new games software development kit (SDK) for PC gaming centered primarily on new livestreaming features, said Alex Hopmann, software engineer for games at Facebook, in a blog post.\nThe new livestreaming applications programming interface (API) makes it possible for developers to add Facebook streaming functionality directly into their PC games. This means that now, in a matter of seconds, players can livestream from the game client to a Facebook surface (Profile, Pages, Groups) without any hardware or third-party software required.\nThe new livestreaming API will also be available for mobile developers in the coming weeks via an updated mobile SDK.\nImage Credit: Facebook\nAnd a new rewards feature enables developers to grant free, in-game rewards for viewers that tune in during livestreams on Facebook. Rewards help to increase community interaction as players watch together while also offering an incentive to jump back into the games.\nHi-Rez Studios, developer of Paladins: Champions of the Realm, has been testing rewards during the Paladins Global Series and has seen increased engagement and very positive viewer feedback. Based on the strong results, Hi-Rez will officially launch rewards during the Paladins Premier League on March 24. And Facebook is making the rewards feature available for all PC game developers.\nMore than 800 million gamers play a Facebook-connected game each month, and the games SDK is the engine that helps to power the community across every gaming surface from mobile to console to PC.\nThe PC-game-streaming feature will help developers bring more players into their games earlier, for longer chunks of time, and more often, Facebook said. Players will soon be able to record great gaming moments and share videos on Facebook Pages, Groups, and Profiles via a new clipping feature that is in the works.\nFacebook Login and Friend Finder are tools to help game developers connect their communities together. At BlizzCon, Blizzard cited a Facebook integration called Suggested Friends as a key contributing factor to seeing players double their network of friends on Battle.net, the studio\u2019s online gaming platform.\nWith Key Player Stats, a new feature in the games SDK, PC game developers can help their community connect by integrating real-time player stats from their titles into Facebook Groups. As a topic, games make up one of the largest categories of Groups on Facebook overall. Now, players can post their stats to a Group to connect and find others to play with.\nLastly, Facebook said PC developers can integrate custom App Events and leverage Facebook Analytics to better optimize and understand their game\u2019s community activity. This new feature in the games SDK for PC game development was previously available on mobile and web. Over time, the content and activity that game communities organically create on Facebook will form a unique gamer graph, allowing PC developers to better deliver experiences players want.\n}}
{{Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's banned Islamist opposition movement, have created their own social networking site. It's called Ikhwanbook (Ikhwan means \"brotherhood\" in Arabic).

Rather than poach qualified experts from universities, Facebook is hoping to create a model where both the public and private sectors can benefit.\n\u201cProfessors gain a different type of experience in industry that can have a positive impact on their students and on their research,\u201d LeCun said. \u201cAdditionally, their connection with industry helps produce new scientific advances that may be difficult to achieve in an academic environment, and helps turn those advances into practical technology. Universities are familiar with the concept of faculty with part-time appointments in industry. It is common in medicine, law, and business. \u201d\nLeCun stressed that the company\u2019s goal with its FAIR program was to create a healthy partnership between Facebook and the universities which contributed to its research labs.\n\u201cUnlike others, we work with universities to find suitable arrangements and do not hire away large numbers of faculty into full-time positions bottled up behind a wall of non-disclosure agreements,\u201d he added. \u201cWe contribute to local ecosystem.\u201d\nFacebook itself has plenty of reasons to be investing in A.I. Many of the company\u2019s latest initiatives, such as photo and video sorting ,are reliant on machine learning. The social network is also experimenting with A.I. that can read text in order to help filter out hate speech and extremist organizations.\n}}
{{Only about half of teenagers use Facebook these days, says a new Pew Research Center study.\nThe study, published Thursday, showed that only 51 percent of surveyed kids age 13 to 17 said they use Facebook. In 2015 that number was 71 percent, and Facebook was the dominant social media platform.\nPew Research Center\nYouTube, which wasn\u2019t included as a social media platform in the 2015 study, is the most popular, used by 85 percent of teens polled. Instagram is used by 72 percent of teenagers, and Snapchat by 69 percent. (Teenagers polled were allowed to choose more than one platform this year, and the two surveys used slightly different methods to ask teens about their social media use.)\nThe study also looked into how teens view the impact that social media has on their lives. Only 24 percent said they believe it has a \u201cmostly negative effect\u201d on people their age, whereas the vast majority believe it is mostly positive or has neither a positive or a negative effect.\nPew Research Center\nThe Pew study also showed that a significant percentage of U.S. teens play video games \u2015 including computer, console and cellphone games \u2015 which is not surprising. Eighty-three percent of teenage girls responded that they play video games, versus 97 percent of teenage boys.\nThe survey was conducted using the online NORC AmeriSpeak panel to reach 743 teenagers from March 7 to April 10. Interviews were conducted online and by telephone.\nWith the inclusion of YouTube and the dominance of video games in the lives of teenagers, it\u2019s possible that gaming platforms like Twitch will play a more significant role in the next survey.\n}}
{{Making your advertising dollars count is important to the success of your organization and you have to draw on as many sources as possible to make informed decisions about where to spend those dollars. Since online advertising is one of the most effective components of any modern ad campaign, I want to look at Facebook advertising as it seems to be one of the trendiest spaces available today.\nThis next graph comes to us from NeuroFocus.Com, a Nielsen affiliated company, committed to using neuroscience to enhance marketing and advertising efforts. The graph is the result of a study on advertising in different contexts and the subsequent attention, engagement, retention, and overall effectiveness of campaigns utilizing the different platforms. In this case they compare company website, Television, and Facebook ads.\nTake a look at what they found:\nSo the company website receives the most attention toward the product, but Facebook wins for overall effectiveness and emotional engagement in the product ads, which in this case is Visa. Memory retention is best on television, but it is outweighed by overall effectiveness. I am sure there are other psychological factors at play here too.\nThe following infographic comes to us from Brian Carter, a recognized expert in the field of online advertising and media campaigns. What he shows us is the value of $100 spent on Google versus the same amount on Facebook. The numbers are pretty revealing.\nCheck out what he found:\nThe results really speak for themselves. The ads on Facebook reach fifteen times more people and get thirty-five time more exposure. Obviously Google is great place to advertise, but Facebook seems like a lot of value for your dollars. I would research it further before taking the plunge, but Carter does present some convincing figures.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive search to find the best advertising platform, but it should give you some ammo to get started. More or less, these are just fun comparisons and interesting facts about angles researches have taken while attempting to bring value to marketing campaigns.\n}}
{{On Thursday night, Facebook experienced a major worldwide outage that lasted, in some cases, for a couple of hours. Things have been less-than-perfect for users since then, even after Facebook released a statement saying that everything should be a-ok. Users were still reporting this morning that Facebook was either slow to load or down altogether, although things seem to have cleared up for most users as of the writing of this article.\nNot only was the outage a problem for Facebook and its users, but apparently it also hurt some major e-commerce sites that sat \u201cspinning\u201d while waiting for resources from Facebook to load. It appears that sites that were affected were ones that connect to Facebook\u2019s open graph, display the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d button, etc. According to web monitoring company Catchpoint, sites with Facebook plugins experienced \u201cmassive performance and usability issues\u201d during the outage.\nSome of the sites affected belonged to retailers like JCPenney, Urban Outfitter, L.L. Bean, Teleflora, and 1-800-Flowers.\nFrom Catchpoint:\nThe issue affected mostly web sites that have placed the Facebook code inline in their page. From an end-user perspective the \u201cspinning hourglass\u201d never stopped while loading the web page because the browser waited and waited and waited for resources to www.facebook.com to complete which they never did. Worst case scenario users might have seen pages hanging or functionality of the page was impaired.\nBy contrast, sites that loaded content before making third-party requests didn\u2019t show any problems on the user end.\nHere\u2019s a graph that they provide showing how one of the aforementioned retailers was affected:\nFor webmasters, this kind of thing is a reminder that outages of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google can affect their sites in a pretty serious way. Of course, Catchpoint makes a point to say that it\u2019s more of a \u201cwake up call\u201d for site owners to be prepared and build their sites in a way that expects this sort of thing.\nAs far as the outage goes, many speculated that Anonymous may have been behind the attack. They responded via Twitter with an emphatic no:\nFollow @YourAnonNews Anonymous\n@YourAnonNews Note: Anonymous would never attack Facebook, we have said this many times. Why would we attack a tool that many anons use to spread info?\n[h/t Business Insider\n}}
{{UPDATED, 4:15 p.m. ET: Shares of rebounded into positive territory Wednesday, halting a two-day slide as the company and investors continue to reel from a data-privacy scandal that has damaged public trust in the social-media giant.\n\u2019s stock closed up 0.7% for the day, after opening down 2% and then ticking up as much as 3% during trading Wednesday. The stock is still down 8.5% from its closing price last Friday, before details of the scandal first emerged, representing a $45.6 billion decline in Facebook\u2019s market cap since then.\nThe storm whipping around Facebook centers on Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based consulting firm that obtained access to details on some 50 million Facebook users \u2014 without their knowledge or consent. Cambridge Analytica did work for Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign. While the firm has denied using the Facebook data in question on Trump\u2019s behalf, Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday suspended its CEO after he was caught boasting about their extensive contributions to the campaign in a Channel 4 documentary. Facebook claims it was deceived by the researcher who turned over the data.\nIn the wake of the controversy, the hashtag \u201c#DeleteFacebook\u201d has been gaining steam as users vent their frustration. On Tuesday, Brian Acton, one of the founders of WhatsApp \u2014 which Facebook acquired in a deal valued at $19 billion \u2014 called for a boycott in a tweet: \u201cIt is time. #deletefacebook.\u201d\nActon is now executive chairman of Signal Foundation, a non-profit org developing open-source privacy technology. He has a net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes estimates.\nAlso Tuesday, venture-capital investor Roger McNamee \u2014 one of Facebook\u2019s earliest backers \u2014 warned in an interview with CNN that the company\u2019s top executives are failing to deal with a crisis that could \u201cdestroy\u201d it.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t even taken the first step of admitting there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do something pretty soon, people are going to realize they can\u2019t trust Facebook anymore\u201d and that could \u201cthreaten them permanently.\u201d McNamee, who still holds Facebook stock, added that Facebook senior execs \u201care not talking to me anymore, so I have to communicate through the press.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, CFRA Research upgraded its rating on Facebook from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cstrong buy,\u201d but cut its 12-month price target on the stock by $40 per share, to $120.\n\u201cApplying discounts, given more reputational and regulatory risks related to the Cambridge Analytica situation, results in our target,\u201d CFRA director of equity research Scott Kessler wrote in a note. Although Facebook \u201cis in the crosshairs\u201d of regulators, legislators, and lawyers related to its policies and business practices, he added, \u201cWe believe FB will make it through this difficult period, and note a 15% decline [in the stock price] from last month\u2019s high.\u201d\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not commented publicly on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. His last public post on the social service was on March 2, nearly three weeks ago. [UPDATE: Zuckerberg released a statement Wednesday afternoon acknowledging the company made \u201cmistakes\u201d and pledging steps to restore user trust.]\nThe company is the target of a class-action lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a San Francisco federal court by shareholders who allege Facebook misled them because it didn\u2019t disclose the unauthorized access to user data by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook also is facing an FTC probe and lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe have called for hearings on the matter.\nIn statements to the media, Facebook has said Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg are working \u201caround the clock\u201d to address the issue.\n\u201cThe entire company is outraged we were deceived,\u201d Facebook said in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\u201d\nSo far, the Cambridge Analytica news and the #DeleteFacebook campaign do not appear to be slowing down new, first-time installs of the Facebook app, according to mobile-analytics research firm Sensor Tower. (The firm does not provide info on app uninstalls.)\nSince Monday, user ratings for the Facebook app in Apple\u2019s App Store have about 86% negative sentiment (two or fewer stars out of five), but that\u2019s only slightly higher than the 83% negative sentiment during the two weeks prior to the Cambridge Analytica news breaking. In addition, less than 10% of reviews for the app so far this week mention Cambridge Analytica or data-privacy concerns, per Sensor Tower.\n}}
{{There is a glitch in the matrix at the University of Nevada at Reno, where two students from the 1910s have joined Facebook.\nJoe McDonald's profile says that he likes to box, that his favorite musicians include W.C. Handy, Irving Berlin and Scott Joplin. He's listed as \"In a relationship\" with Leola Lewis, who, according to her profile, enjoys embroidery and the literary works of Jane Austen and Edgar Allen Poe. Neither mention Angry Birds or Kanye West.\nThe two profiles are actually the creation of Donnelyn Curtis, director of the university's research collections, reports The Chronicle of Higher Education. McDonald and Lewis graduated in 1915 and 1913, respectively, and later married, according to the report. Curtis created their profiles after gaining approval from the granddaughter of McDonald, who died in 1971.\nCurtis told the Chronicle that the unique project is meant \"to help history come alive a little bit for students\" and expose the university's special collections to a wider audience. Curtis writes all of the couple's status updates, which incude messages that express worry about \"a possible smallpox epidemic,\" eagerly anticipate \"sleighrides,\" and recount McDonald's job at a mining company.\n\"It\u2019s been hard to walk the line between being historically accurate and making it interesting for college students,\" Curtis told the Chronicle.\nMcDonald's photos include pictures of \"Rugby Football\" matches from 1912 and school field trips. Lewis's profile sports photos from on-campus events and one shot the university's representative at women's suffrage conference. \"Thanks to her hard work, Nevada women should be able to vote in 1914!\" reads the caption.\nCurtis said that at first only extended family members of the couple sent friend requests, but each now have well over 100 connections. She also told the Chronicle that, in hopes of expanding interest in the project, she is considering creating a Facebook profile for another student who was a friend of the couple but left school to work in a mine. She also might invite more recent alumni of the university to create profiles depicting themselves in college during the 1950s and 1960s.\nFor now, though, McDonald and Lewis appear to be adjusting well to their reincarnated lives online.\nIn his most recent status update, McDonald wrote of heading back to campus from a nearby mining town and said he is \"feeling lucky to have so many Friends, from all times and places, old and new.\"\nNo word yet on whether or not McDonald and Lewis are considering a switch to Facebook Timeline.\nWhat do you think of this project? Would you like to see more ideas like this catch on? Let us know in the comments.\n}}
{{Facebook just hit us up with some very good news: it knows the email system has screwed up contact lists around the internet, it knows what the problem is, and it's fixing the mess tomorrow.\nAccording to the Facebook engineer we spoke with, the root of the problem is a long-standing bug with the way your mobile devices talk to Facebook when syncing contacts. The system is designed to pull down your most recent email address added to your Timeline, and then add this address \u2014 not overwrite anything \u2014 to a given friend in your address book. This makes sense, as the email account you've most recently added is in all likelihood the one you care about most.\nBut then Facebook started auto-adding @facebook.com email addresses to our profiles without asking, meaning our most recent email address was one we both didn't know about and didn't want. And then it started deleting the existing one. These two problems hitting at the same time meant your friends' contact information was updated with junk info and replacing what you actually wanted.\nFacebook says the bug \"only affects a small number of users\", and that these unlucky folks are \"mostly older Android devices\" \u2014 but either way, Facebook is cleaning up its act starting tomorrow, meaning all it should take is a fresh contact sync to put your contacts back to the way you wanted them. Whatever your friends have designated as their primary email address \u2014 assuming it's accessible via privacy settings \u2014 will be the one downloaded to your phone. Period. Phew. Finally.\nUpdate: A Facebook spokesperson sent over the company's official word on both disappearing messages and syncing bugs:\n}}
{{Facebook may not be at CES, but the social network is busy readying its own announcement for next week. We don\u2019t know what the company will be announcing, but it has one announcement this week to tide you over.\nIn its weekly platform update, Facebook announced that it is changing how its API reports public app usage metrics. For the longest time, the reported metrics was just a number showing how many monthly active users any particular app had. There was no way to actually rank apps without looking through all the metrics available, or using a third party service like AppData. That\u2019s all changing next week.\nStarting January 16, Facebook will move to reporting app usage by overall rank and active user thresholds. For example, the social network says that an app with 1.1 million MAU will now be reported as having more than 1 million users as well as being the #300 largest app. Facebook says the new metrics reporting will \u201cprovide a more consistent view of the ecosystem and highlight successful apps earlier in the lifecycle.\u201d\nDevelopers need not worry about the change as the new metrics are for general reporting use only. It won\u2019t impact the actual number of users any particular app has, and developers can still see the exact number of users their apps have in App Insights. With that being said, developers should be aware that Facebook will be adding \u201cdaily_active_users_rank\u201d and \u201cmonthly_active_users_rank\u201d to the application object via the Graph API and FQL to provide access to the new ranking API.\nAs usual, the weekly announcements are closed out with a bug report. In the past week, Facebook received 202 bug reports with 111 bugs being accepted for further review. The social network also fixed 51 bugs. You can see the full list by hitting up the blog post.\n}}
{{Frustration is brewing at top levels inside Facebook over what has become a pattern during the controversies that have bedeviled the company recently: The public silence of co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nFacebook now has 2 billion users, unprecedented reach, and a CEO whose name is recognized all over the world. But in what\u2019s turned out to be one of the hardest years in the company\u2019s history, Zuckerberg has remained notably out of the public fray. Now there\u2019s a growing feeling within Facebook\u2019s top tiers that he needs to speak more quickly and more openly on the company\u2019s controversies and challenges.\n\u201cThe thing that sets Facebook apart [from other tech companies,]\u201d said a source at the company, is that \u201cMark and Sheryl [Sandberg] are brands themselves \u2026 they\u2019re pretty widely recognized. They have strong personal brands and people expect to hear from them when Facebook is in crisis.\u201d\nAnd this is a moment of crisis for Facebook. The company is facing multiple uphill battles, from fake news to Russian trolls\u2019 weaponization of the platform to the latest controversy, over Cambridge Analytica and user data.\nThe FTC is sending a letter to Facebook Tuesday with questions about how the social media company allowed the data of more than 50 million users to wind up in the hands of Trump campaign consultants, a Facebook source told CNN.\nFacebook sources have told CNN they believe it will take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in the company\u2019s commitment to privacy and data protection.\nIn addition to the FTC\u2019s interest, Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner have called on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. \u201cThe American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election,\u201d Warner tweeted. And, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Saturday that her office is opening an investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\nFacebook representatives will also go to Capitol Hill this week to brief staff for the House and Senate Intelligence, Judiciary and Commerce committees on the scandal, a company spokesperson told CNN.\nAccording to insiders, Zuckerberg is well respected within the company, and genuinely passionate about making the world a better place. But even though he\u2019s a staple behind the scenes, top-level executives are becoming ever more frustrated over his not speaking more publicly on many of the complicated issues that have plagued the company in the last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s his company. People on the outside want to hear from him,\u201d said one top-level executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the story. \u201cThere is a sense that Mark doesn\u2019t get his hands dirty until problems are way too far down the road.\u201d\nMany high-level officials want Zuckerberg to get involved earlier and put his name on big issues like the current controversy over Cambridge Analytica, the top-level executive said. \u201cThe consensus is that we should be more open more quickly and that Mark needs to be the face on very difficult topics.\u201d\nThere are of course other people at Facebook who can speak publicly, and at other tech companies that\u2019s often what happens. If there\u2019s a problem at Microsoft, another Facebook source noted, people aren\u2019t calling for CEO Satya Nadella to speak out. But the difference is the level of name recognition that Zuckerberg and his COO, Sheryl Sandberg, have in the outside world.\nNo matter who\u2019s speaking out, it\u2019s difficult to distill the conversation to soundbites, blog posts or after-the-fact Facebook Lives starring Zuckerberg that take place once a problem has become a crisis.\nThe types of problems Facebook has to solve don\u2019t have easy answers. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a desire internally to have a public discussion around the challenges that come along with solving those problems.\n\u201cThese things have so much nuance in them,\u201d a second top-level executive frustrated by Zuckerberg\u2019s public absence said. \u201cEvery answer has tradeoffs.\u201d\nBut the public rarely gets insight into the behind-the-scenes conversations at Facebook, even when the decisions made during them could impact a significant portion of the population.\n\u201cWe want to tell the public more\u2026tell the hard story more. If we don\u2019t tell it, people write it for us,\u201d the second top-level executive said.\nThe first top-level executive echoed that. \u201cThe problems are legitimately hard tradeoffs\u2026 but we aren\u2019t willing to say that,\u201d they said. \u201cCracking down on fake news can also lead to censorship of independent news sources, when we restrict data access it hurts legit developers and researchers\u2026 It would help the quality of the public discussion if we recognized that publicly.\u201d\nAfter this story was initially published, a Facebook spokesperson provided a statement to CNN.\n\u201cMark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\u201d\n}}

{{The purchase of Face.com by Facebook is happening and is a done deal, say multiple TechCrunch sources.\nThose familiar with the matter have confirmed the price will be $100m, as per the media speculation in the last few days. So far Face.com itself has declined to comment. CEO Gil Hirsch told us via email today \u201cI have nothing to announce.\u201d However, among our sources, one told us \u201cYes, the wheels are in motion on the deal\u201d. We understand lawyers are huddling over the details of the deal right now but the acquisition is agreed.\nNow, whether Moscow-based search engine Yandex is selling its stake in the Israeli company to Facebook instead of this being an outright acquisition remains only one outstanding detail that has not yet been confirmed. Yandex, together with Israeli investment fund Rhodium, put $4.3 million into Face.com in return for 18.4 percent of the company. Yandex CEO, Arkady Volozh, joined Face.com\u2019s board of directors, according to Vedomosti, as picked up by GigaOm. Vedomosti has sources that say Yandex wants cash and stock in Facebook in return for the deal.\nWe\u2019ve already outlined how much sense this deal makes.\nBut CEO Gil Hirsch is a canny player and would have waited for the IPO before calling for his price. It looks like he got it.\nTo review: the facts on the ground to date are:\n\u2022 Israeli business publication Calcalist first reported (in Hebrew) that Facebook was looking to purchase Face.com.\n\u2022 The deal size has been put at $80 million and $100 million. We\u2019re calling it at $100m.\n\u2022 Face.com\u2019s technology is a natural acquisition target for Facebook. Photos are core to Facebook\u2019s lock-in strategy and facial recognition allows tags to better reflect the social graph, which then feeds into making its advertising platform more efficient.\n\u2022 There is evidence the two companies have been talking for some time (after all, Face.com appeared in 2007) but a price was never agreed until now. A post-IPO Facebook can now afford it.\n\u2022 Face.com\u2019s popular Facebook application Photo Tagger allows people to scan their (or their friends\u2019) photo albums for known faces. It also has the iOS facial recognition app KLIK and a public API that could benefit Facebook.\n\u2022 Facebook\u2019s own camera app could integrate the Face.com API.\n\u2022 Face.com has so far raised $5.3 million from Yandex and Rhodium\n}}
{{Facebook is bursting out of the ones and zeros into the physical realm with nine brick-and-mortar pop-up stores that will show off goods from 100 small business and online brands. Facebook organized the merchants to be part of The Market @ Macy\u2019s, which first launched earlier this year to create temporary spaces for businesses. The merchants keep all their sales revenue, with Facebook and Macy\u2019s taking no revenue share, and Facebook paid for each merchant\u2019s one-time fee that Macy\u2019s charges for the space. The stores feature News Feed post-themed displays complete with like button imagery so it feels like you\u2019re shopping Facebook in real life.\nWhile Facebook doesn\u2019t earn money directly from the stores, it could convince the small businesses and others like them to spend more on Facebook ads. Alongside recent tests of advanced Instagram analytics and instant Promote ads for Stories, Facebook wants to build a deeper relationship with small businesses so this long tail of advertisers sticks with it as sharing and marketing shift from the News Feed toward Stories and private messaging.\n\u201cAll over the world people are running businesses, big and small, that have inspiring stories and we want to help them succeed. We are thrilled to be partnering with one of the world\u2019s biggest retailers to bring some of those businesses to a physical store this holiday season,\u201d writes Facebook\u2019s Director of North America Marketing Michelle Klein. \u201cMacy\u2019s shoppers will have the chance to meet businesses like Love Your Melon that sells hats and apparel to help in the fight against pediatric cancer, or Charleston Gourmet Burger Company that started from a backyard barbecue and has expanded to reach customers in all 50 states.\u201d\nThe nine pop-ups will be open from today until February 2nd in The Market @ Macy\u2019s in NYC, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, San Antonio, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The brands come from across apparel, lifestyle, food, beauty and other verticals, and include Two Blind Brothers, Bespoke Post, Inspiralized, Mented Cosmetics and Link. Facebook seems taken with the idea of having a physical presence in the world, with the pop-ups coming just days before Facebook starts shipping its first hardware product, the Facebook Portal video chat device.\nFacebook will also run a big ad campaign of its own in NYC\u2019s Grand Central Station for the next three weeks to promote the pop-ups, featuring 600 ad units with 36 designs across 115 locations in the public transportation hub. Facebook will also run ads for the stores on its app and Instagram, and provide the merchants with complementary digital ad design from Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop.\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth has been massively decelerating, dropping from 59 percent year-over-year in Q3 2016 to 49 percent in Q3 2017 to 33 percent in Q3 2018. That\u2019s introduced uncharacteristic share price declines and volatility for Facebook\u2019s historically stable business. Delighting small businesses with experiences like the pop-up stores could keep them loyal as Facebook\u2019s ad formats shift toward more vivid and interactive formats that can be tough for budget-strapped merchants to adopt.\n}}
{{Facebook has been evolving and if you ask the average small business owner, not all Facebook change is good change. When a platform's technology is beyond your control, how do you adapt your business strategy to keep up?\nI asked eight startup founders from Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) how they have improved Facebook engagement, even in spite of recent algorithm changes that had some business owners running to other platforms. Here's what they had to say:\n1. Integrated approach\nA few years ago we relied heavily on fan page interactions. Now with the changes made we have seen dramatic drops in engagement through Facebook for our brand. To counter this we have taken a more integrated approach with all our social networks and started to use pins and tweets in A/B tests to gauge fan interactions. If something catches the attention of viewers, then we also share it on Facebook.\n\u2014 Jerry Piscitelli, Portopong LLC\n2. Great content\nNo matter what the algorithm is, great content will always rise to the top. We think about great content as information that our fans can use. An algorithm change impacts all businesses, not just ours. Focus on creating content that your fans love and will want to share \u2014 the best content will always rise to the top.\n\u2014 Aaron Schwartz, Modify Watches\n3. Don't game\nOur focus on any social network has always been about real engagement instead of vanity metrics. As every social network shifts to embrace quality over quantity, Facebook will only increasingly reward excellent content.\n\u2014 Derek Flanzraich, Greatist\n4. Staff engagement\nWe are definitely getting less natural engagement, but we've done a few things to offset it. Firstly, we're beefing up staff engagement and sharing of our posts. Facebook won't hide personal updates. Secondly, we're working more with Facebook ads; they've been hit and miss so far. Finally, we're putting money and effort elsewhere. Twitter, Linkedin, Pinterest, partnerships and on-the-ground marketing all drive people to our site, so that we're not reliant on Facebook.\n\u2014 Carlo Cisco, SELECT\n5. Email marketing\nSocial media is fickle yet necessary, but diversification is even more so. As a small business with Facebook as our number one source of referral traffic, the change hit us hard. But a few things are helping us keep ahead of the curve and outside the box. We don't post just to post; however, we have found that posting 4-6 times a day increases engagement without paying. Our numbers are heavy on Facebook and lower on Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and Pinterest. We cross-promote with exclusive content, contests, flash sales and discounts to help spread the fan love. To this day, email marketing still trumps all social in regards to conversions. We incentivize email signups.\n\u2014 Alexander Mendeluk, SpiritHoods\nSee also: 10 Hot Social Networks to Watch\n6. Autonomics\nAutonomic (intelligent automation) tools are just now hitting the market but are already allowing us to maintain our edge and maintain strong, non-paid marketing efforts on the Facebook platform. Autonomic tools use big data and best practices to ensure your marketing sees the right people at the right time, with the right message. With continued changes to the Facebook algorithm, these tools will soon be the only way to use Facebook and avoid pay-to-play.\n\u2014 Brennan White, Watchtower\n7. Timing and content\nFacebook is changing the way we consume media. You used to be able to post a picture and have it go viral. Now Facebook is favoring content. If your business isn't posting amazing articles that people will like, your EdgeRank will go down and your business page will fade into the dark. By posting at times when people read and click on articles, our business page has stayed ahead of the curve and we consistently see improvements in our Facebook interactions.\n\u2014 John Rampton, Adogy\n8. Diversification\nNo sweat. We're beefing up in other areas of social media. We've really been flexing our muscle with Google+ and LinkedIn. With the time we that aren't investing in Facebook for our social clients, we're putting towards getting more dynamic and playful with Pinterest and Twitter. You know what they say about when one social medium closes....\n\u2014 Maren Hogan, Red Branch Media\n}}
{{In what looks like a way to promote equality, Facebook has changed some of its icons to give the female silhouettes a more prominent spot.\nFrom its previous design where the Friends and Groups icons showed female silhouettes in the background of the male silhouette, the social media giant has tweaked them, putting the female in a better spot. The new Friends icon now shows a man and a woman side by side, and the Groups icon, albeit still being outnumbered by men, now shows a woman in the foreground.\nFacebook design manager Caitlin Winner, who designed the new icon to better show equality, said that she \"assumed no ill intentions, just a lack of consideration\" in how the old icons were designed.\nThe old icon shows that \u201cthe woman was quite literally in the shadow of the man,\u201d Winner said in a blog post on Medium. While the man \u201csymmetrical except for his spiked hairdo,\u201d the lady \u201chad a chip in her shoulder.\"\nOn top of this symbolism of inequality, Winner adds that the female silhouette in the old icon was poorly-designed, which she described as a \u201cDarth Vader-like\u201d silhouette. It has led Winner to further redesign the female silhouette with a \"slightly more shapely bob.\"\nThe changes in these icons came right after Facebook changed its logo for aesthetic purposes. The new icons, however, are only visible through the mobile app as of the moment.\n}}
{{BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Child development experts and advocates are urging Facebook to pull the plug on its new messaging app aimed at kids.\nA group letter sent Tuesday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg argues that younger children \u2014 the app is intended for those under 13 \u2014 aren\u2019t ready to have social media accounts, navigate the complexities of online relationships or protect their own privacy.\nFacebook launched the free Messenger Kids app in December, pitching it as a way for children to chat with family members and friends approved by parents. It doesn\u2019t give kids separate Facebook or Messenger accounts. Rather, the app works as an extension of a parent\u2019s account, and parents get controls such as the ability to decide who their kids can chat with.\nThe social media giant has said it fills \u201ca need for a messaging app that lets kids connect with people they love but also has the level of control parents want.\u201d But critics see the move as a way for Facebook to lure in a younger audience before they could move on to a rival service such as Snapchat.\n\u201cTARGETING YOUNGER CHILDREN\u201d\nA group of 100 experts, advocates and parenting organizations is contesting Facebook\u2019s claims of filling a need. Led by the Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the group includes psychiatrists, pediatricians, educators and the children\u2019s music singer Raffi Cavoukian.\n\u201cMessenger Kids is not responding to a need \u2014 it is creating one,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt appeals primarily to children who otherwise would not have their own social media accounts.\u201d Another passage criticized Facebook for \u201ctargeting younger children with a new product.\u201d\nIn a statement, Facebook said on Monday that the app \u201chelps parents and children to chat in a safer way,\u201d and emphasized that parents are \u201calways in control\u201d of their kids\u2019 activity. The social media giant added that it consulted with parenting experts and families, and said \u201cthere is no advertising in Messenger Kids.\u201d\nKIDS AND FACEBOOK\nA variety of experts and technology insiders have begun questioning the effects smartphones and social media apps are having on people\u2019s health and mental well-being \u2014 whether kids, teens or adults. Sean Parker, Facebook\u2019s first president, said late last yearthat the social media platform exploits \u201cvulnerability in human psychology\u201d to addict users. A chorus of other early employees and investors piled on with similar criticisms.\nMany preteens have already found their way onto Facebook and more youth-oriented social media platforms such as Snapchat and Facebook\u2019s own Instagram, despite internal rules that require users to be at least 13 years old. Those rules are based in part on federal law, which prohibits internet companies from collecting personal information on children without their parents\u2019 permission and imposes restrictions on advertising to them.\nSome companies have offered parental controls as a way of curbing unauthorized preteen use of their platforms. But Facebook\u2019s new kid-focused app, which features animations and emojis, seems to cater to a younger audience, said Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.\n\u201cIt looks like something that would appeal to a 6-year-old or 7-year-old,\u201d he said.\nHe said the app gets those younger ones used to Facebook\u2019s platform \u201cand then they transition to the mature version of Facebook.\u201d\nUNCERTAIN IMPACT\nFacebook wouldn\u2019t answer questions about how popular the messaging app has been. But App Annie, an app analytics firm, said Messenger Kids has been downloaded about 80,000 times on Apple\u2019s iOS devices \u2014 iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch \u2014 since it launched on Dec. 4. It\u2019s been in the top 40 most popular kids\u2019 apps since then. That sounds like a lukewarm reception at best.\nUniversity of Michigan developmental behavioral pediatrician Jenny Radesky, who co-signed the letter, said she\u2019s never met a parent who was clamoring to get their children onto social media at an earlier age.\n\u201cOne can only assume that Facebook introduced it to engage users younger and younger,\u201d Radesky said.\nThat\u2019s troubling, she said, because younger children haven\u2019t yet developed the cognitive skills that enable them to think about and regulate their thoughts and actions and \u201callow them to realize when persuasive technology design might be manipulating them.\u201d\nAt the time it launched Messenger Kids, Facebook said it won\u2019t show ads or collect data for marketing to kids. And it stressed that it won\u2019t automatically move users to the regular Messenger or Facebook when they get old enough \u2014 though it might give them the option to move contacts to Messenger down the line.\n}}
{{Facebook toyed with the idea of adding a \"sympathise\" button to the social network, for when \"like\" doesn't quite apply.\nAs reported by the Huffington Post, a developer came up with the \"sympathise\" option at a recent hackathon event. It would only appear if your friend labelled their Facebook post with a negative emotion, the blog said.\nFacebook has no plans to add the sympathise option to the site yet; like any tech firm, it experiments with features all the time. But the topic came up during a presentation from Facebook engineer Dan Muriello at Facebook's Compassion Research Day.\nThe event, which took place last week, shares \"everything we've learned in the last year about what happens when you apply the science of how people relate to each other to social technology.\" It was organised in conjunction with Stanford's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education Compassion and Technology Conference.\nFor years, Facebook users have requested a \"dislike\" button for posts on the social network, but the company has thus far declined to go negative.\nDuring a 2010 interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said the \"dislike\" button is \"something that we would definitely think about,\" but he did not commit to adding it to the site. Later, a \"dislike\" app scam made the rounds on Facebook; rather than adding the functionality, it stole your information.\nFor now, the only option is \"like,\" which is definitely not appropriate for all situations. Of course, one might argue that it's not exactly a huge task to type a sympathetic comment like, \"I'm sorry,\" or \"I'm here for you.\"\nBut this is the age of Facebook, so sometimes you only have time for a click.\n}}
{{Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg at the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity in Cannes on June 18, 2014. Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg\nOn Thursday YouTube celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first video being uploaded to what would become the preeminent online video service. And Facebook crashed the party.\nFacebook announced on Thursday a branded-video program called Anthology that will have publishers and digital video producers including Vice, Vox Media, Tastemade and Funny or Die creating videos for advertisers -- in collaboration with Creative Shop, Facebook's in-house agency -- that would run as ads on the social network.\nAdditional publishers involved in the Anthology program are The Onion, Electus Digital and Oh My Disney.\nThe Anthology program's business model is similar to the typical branded-content deal. An advertiser links up with a publisher or production company and pays them to produce a video or series of videos for the brand. The brand then takes that content and pays another publisher to run it as an ad, often on Google's YouTube.\nBut with Anthology, advertisers are required to run videos created through the program as ads on Facebook, according to a Facebook spokesman. That could boost Facebook's position as it tries to usurp YouTube's position as the go-to destination for digital-video advertising.\nFacebook is already catching up to YouTube as consumers' go-to destination for digital-video watching. On Wednesday Facebook announced that its users are averaging 4 billion video views a day, up from 1 billion views per day in September. YouTube no longer reports its total daily video views, but the Google-owned video service said in January 2012 that it had notched 4 billion daily video views.\nFacebook and its publishing/production partners are not splitting the revenue from Anthology deals, according to the Facebook spokesman. Facebook will keep the money the brand spends to advertise the campaign on Facebook, and the publishing/production partners will keep the money the brand spends to produce the campaign. Publishers can dig up additional revenue by getting the advertiser to pay to run the Anthology videos as sponsored content on the publisher's own site, and the publisher wouldn't have to share that money with Facebook.\nAdvertisers will also be able to run these ads as ads on non-Facebook properties, such as YouTube, Yahoo, Hulu or linear TV. The advertiser is ultimately responsible for distribution.\nFacebook has been doing this kind of branded-video work with brands and publishers for a couple years, dating back to Budweiser's \"Made for Music\" campaign with Vice, which also did campaigns with Lufthansa and Bose. With Anthology, the company has formalized that work.\nBut brands can do these kinds of branded content deals with companies sans Facebook and its requirement that the videos run as ads on the social network. So why get Facebook involved? Because Facebook has a bunch of data on the types of videos people want to watch. Companies that are part of its Anthology program will be able to use that Facebook data to inform the content they're developing for advertisers.\n}}
{{In November 2011, Ilya Zhitomirskiy, a 22-year-old founding member of the social network Diaspora, committed suicide in his San Francisco bedroom. It was just three days before the scheduled release of his company\u2019s beta product\u2014a highly anticipated Facebook alternative that would allow users to control their own data. Zhitomirskiy had a history of depression, but his decision was apparently spurred by a number of factors: A year and a half after he and three NYU friends moved West with $200,000 raised on Kickstarter and loads of publicity, they were fighting, their CEO just quit, and the money was dwindling.\nIn Jim Dwyer\u2019s More Awesome Than Money, Ilya\u2019s suicide goes beyond the merely tragic to the symbolic. On the surface, Dwyer\u2019s book is an up-close look at a Silicon Valley tech start-up, packed with stories of late night brainstorming sessions, venture capital pitches, wild memed parties, and endless coding. But this is no capitalist success story. The Diaspora Four, as the founders are referred to, are idealists; they were inspired to launch their company after attending a speech about freedom and social justice on the Internet.\nAs the story of their business unfolds, global events crowd their way into the narrative. The book covers the years 2010-2013, when the Arab Spring, Occupy movements, and Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations are exploding across the world stage. These events give the potentially abstract issues that the book tackles\u2014government and corporate spying, Internet freedom\u2014an important tangibility. The Internet, ever becoming a greater part of the human experience, is at a crossroads, Dwyer argues in his book. One road leads to freedom, sharing, and equality; the other to endless spying, a hierarchical structure, and repression. The Diaspora Four are trying to navigate their way through all this, and Ilya\u2019s death can be read as a warning about the consequences of choosing the wrong path.\nThe speech that inspired Diaspora was delivered by Eben Moglen, a Columbia law professor and founder of the Software Freedom Law Center. Moglen asserts that the current business model of the Internet, in which personal data is traded for \u201cfree\u201d services, is antithetical to its original intent and \u201chostile to human freedom.\u201d The thorny issues involved in this trade-off have been critiqued powerfully in recent books by Glenn Greenwald, in No Place to Hide, and Julia Angwin, in Dragnet Nation. But Moglen, an Internet scholar, has developed something closer to a philosophy. That philosophy was adopted by the Diaspora Four.\nThe Internet, the philosophy goes, was not meant to be a hierarchy in which large companies own the servers that all the data runs through\u2014and therefore have all the power. It was intended, instead, to be based on \u201cpeerage,\u201d where all players are equal. In short, it was intended to be a place to create a more egalitarian society. Three companies are primarily responsible for corrupting this ideal: Microsoft, Google, and Facebook: Microsoft, because it created the predominant server-client architecture; Google and Facebook because they entrenched the business model of targeted advertising dependent upon data tracking.\nMoglen is particularly critical of Facebook. Why? Because people are social creatures who need to network, and the price to do so should not be privacy. While Google can argue that actual employees do not read your correspondence (their robots do), Facebook can make no such claim. Zuckerberg himself has bragged that he is able to predict which site members will hook up with whom based on their site activity. \u201cMr. Zuckerberg should be bankrupt,\u201d Moglen exhorts.\nThe solution? Software should be \u201copen source\u201d\u2014meaning anyone can view it and contribute\u2014and individual servers, or \u201cpods,\u201d must be developed so everyone can control their own data. Dwyer extends Moglen\u2019s argument here, declaring that this openness is key, because software is \u201ca root activity of humankind in the twenty first century,\u201d and \u201ca basic moral and economic force\u201d that \u201cwould undergird global societies.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a compelling vision, and Dwyer\u2019s account of these kids struggling to realize it is a thrilling read, astoundingly detailed and researched, alternately suspenseful and heartbreaking. (Dwyer was present for many of the events he describes, providing a you-are-in-the-room feel.) I would have liked to see Dwyer directly address obvious questions about Moglen\u2019s philosophy, however. Are there Intellectual Property restrictions on this totally free Internet? How about security exceptions to spying? Absent data tracking, how will Internet companies profit? Indeed, the question of profit is where Moglen\u2019s philosophy gets the murkiest. Doesn\u2019t the very idea of profit, after all, conflict with the ideal of a totally free, collaborative Internet?\nThe answer is left unclear, but Diaspora is certainly intended to be profitable. These kids, as Ilya admits, are part of the 1 percent, and they expect comfortable lives as adults. Some of their stated goals, in fact\u2014Max wants to be a CEO, Dan wants to be his own boss\u2014aren\u2019t as idealistic as Ilya\u2019s, who invariably speaks of using technology to improve the world. By establishing Ilya as his book\u2019s moral center, Dwyer endorses his views, and ultimately the book is less a celebration of capitalism than an attack on it\u2014or the brand that exalts profit above all, anyway.\nA follower of the Occupy movement, Ilya \u201cspoke the language of revolutionary battles,\u201d and his work on Diaspora was \u201cone piece of this broader movement to create more free collaboration and communication.\u201d The book\u2019s title itself, a paraphrasing of Ilya, is an assertion that profit is not the ultimate good. Dwyer begins his book with the full quote: \u201cThere\u2019s something deeper than making money off stuff. Creating stuff for the universe is awesome.\u201d\n}}
{{DNA is often called the \u2018blueprint of life\u2019. That\u2019s because it contains the instructions needed for an organism to grow, develop, survive and reproduce. Almost every cell in your body contains DNA and all the information needed to make you what you are, from the way you look to which hand you write with. What\u2019s more, information is so neatly packed that you could store all of the world\u2019s data (!) on a DNA hard-drive the size of a teaspoon. Of course, that\u2019s a lot easier said than done \u2014 but we\u2019re getting there.\nOne of the latest achievements in the field of DNA data storage comes from Harvard University which for the first time demonstrated CRISPR can be used to encode information in bacterial DNA. The demonstration involved encoding images and a short movie from Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s Human and Animal Locomotion in Escherichia coli DNA.\nCRISPR (you say it like \u201ccrisper\u201d) stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. Scientists use CRISPR as a sort of molecular scissor to target and cut specific sequences of the genome; basically, it\u2019s a way to make our genetic editing much more accurate. Experts say this gene-editing method can be used to eliminate mutations that cause diseases or disabilities. It could also be possibly used to make designer babies that grow smarter or healthier than they normally would have. For instance, in 2015, a team of Chinese scientists made headlines when they used CRISPR in human embryos to prevent a blood disorder called beta thalessemia. It proved very controversial to say the least.\nEarlier this year, a team of American researchers demonstrated a method that can encode 215 petabytes of data \u2014 twice as much as Google and Facebook combined hold in their servers\u2013 on a single gram of DNA or 100 times more than previously shown. The scientists at the New York Genome Center (NYGC) encoded then retrieved without errors a full computer operating system, an 1895 French film, \u201cArrival of a train at La Ciotat,\u201d a $50 Amazon gift card, a computer virus, a Pioneer plaque and a 1948 study by information theorist Claude Shannon.\nThis time, the encoded media was far more modest, as this is the first time CRISPR was used to insert data in DNA. The Harvard researchers led by Professor Seth Shipman encoded very low-resolution images and a short GIF composed of five frames of the mare \u2018Annie G\u2019 galloping at 36\u00d726 pixels. Nucleotides, which are basic building blocks of DNA, are used as the code for each individual pixel. The sequences are delivered over time to living bacteria. Once inserted, the E. coli genome is sequenced and the images are reconstructed by reading the pixel nucleotide code with around 90% accuracy, as reported in Nature.\nObviously, this method won\u2019t be used to store usable data anytime soon but it might prove to be a powerful research tool that might open new frontiers of science. Shipman says he\u2019d like to make \u2018living sensors\u2019 using this method that record what\u2019s happening inside a cell and its environment. Imagine what progress neuroscience could see, for instance, if scientists could record all the molecular events that a neuron undergoes during the course of its lifetime.\n}}
{{Facebook\nFacebook is making it easier for you and your family to be together even if you're not physically together this Christmas with the launch of group video chat for Messenger.\nThe addition to Messenger is the most-requested feature ever, the social network said Monday. Group video chat will begin rolling out immediately to mobile users of the Messenger app.\nIt's the latest in a series of incremental updates to Messenger, which include the addition of a faster camera, masks, stickers and frames. They're designed to keep Facebook attractive to many different age groups as new apps and services like Snapchat become increasingly popular.\nFacebook is also constantly competing with other internet-reliant messaging services such as Skype, Google Hangouts and even WhatsApp, which the social network owns, to ensure it's offering a full suite of possibilities to its users.\nNo matter how large your extended family, most everyone will now be able to join a call on Messenger. Up to six people at a time can participate in video chat conversations, with up to 50 able to join in using voice only.\nTo start a call, you can either begin a new Messenger conversation or jump into an existing one and hit the video icon. Your friends will be alerted and can jump in if and when they're ready. A second option is to ring a few people simultaneously and turn the call into a video chat that way.\n}}
{{Facebook has axed its facial recognition functionality for users in the EU, in order to satisfy the concerns of privacy regulators.\nThe Irish data protection commissioner (DPC) issued his assessment (PDF) on Friday of Facebook\u2019s compliance with recommendations the regulator made last December. The DPC had been forced into the issue following complaints by a group of Austrian law students calling themselves \u2018Europe v Facebook\u2019, and had told Facebook that it had to be more upfront about giving users privacy choices.\nThe review suggested that Facebook had \u201cfully implemented\u201d most of the DPC\u2019s recommendations, and those that had not been implemented would be taken care of \u201cwith a clear timescale\u201d in place.\nAnd one of those moves is apparently to stop recording people\u2019s facial characteristics in order to automatically suggest photo tags.\n\u201cI am particularly encouraged in relation to the approach it has decided to adopt on the tag suggest/facial recognition feature by in fact agreeing to go beyond our initial recommendations, in light of developments since then, in order to achieve best practice,\u201d DPC Billy Hawkes said in a statement. \u201cThis feature has already been turned off for new users in the EU and templates for existing users will be deleted by 15 October, pending agreement with my Office on the most appropriate means of collecting user consent.\u201d\nFacebook, which was targeted in Ireland because that\u2019s where all its non-North American business is based, is also crowing about going beyond the call of duty:\n\u201cThe latest announcement is confirmation that we are not only compliant with European data protection law but we have gone beyond some of their initial recommendations and are fully committed to best practice in data protection compliance.\u201d\nBut guess what? That\u2019s not the end of the story.\nFacebook\u2019s been under fire over precisely the same feature in Germany, where privacy chiefs have accused the social network of \u201cillegally compiling a vast photo database of users without their consent\u201d \u2013 remember, this is the home of data protection law we\u2019re talking about here.\nWhen that last bit of bother struck just one month ago, Facebook insisted that:\n\u201cWe believe that the Photo Tag Suggest feature on Facebook is fully compliant with EU data protection laws.\u201d\nSo what gives?\nEssentially, Facebook has found itself fighting on too many fronts. What began as an obscure concern of people in German-speaking countries has spread: the Norwegian data protection regulator also started probing the feature, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 so did the Article 29 Working Party (WP29).\nThe WP29 is a group of privacy regulators from all over the EU, and its recommendations get taken very seriously indeed. In July it said facial recognition features such as photo-tag suggestions should only be allowed when the user gives their explicit consent (and that means the user being tagged, as well as the one doing the tagging).\nSo yes, Facebook has just gone beyond the Irish DPC\u2019s original recommendation, but only because a higher authority is waving a bigger stick at it, and because the company\u2019s realized it\u2019s not going to win this one.\nIn any case, even though Facebook is wiping the facial recognition templates it\u2019s already recorded for its EU users, it intends to bring the system back once it\u2019s figured out a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to properly informing those users.\nAs for Europe v Facebook, they\u2019re still not happy (no surprise there) but tell me this victory is \u201ctotally going in the right direction\u201d.\nTo give Facebook its due, here are the areas in which the DPC says the company has fully implemented its recommendations:\n\u2022 The provision of better transparency for the user in how their data is handled,\n\u2022 The provision of increased user control over settings,\n\u2022 The implementation of clear retention periods for the deletion of personal data or an enhanced ability for the user to delete items,\n\u2022 The enhancement of the user\u2019s right to have ready access to their personal data and the capacity of FB-I [Facebook Ireland] to ensure rigorous assessment of compliance with Irish and EU data protection requirements.\n}}

Dana Frasz, a self-described freegan and an early Bay Area yerdle user, says those fewer degrees of separation set the service apart from established giving-economy platforms like Freecycle. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting people who know your people, but you just haven\u2019t been connected yet,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt seemed like every single person I met on yerdle was awesome,\u201d Frasz continues. \u201cInstead of just a Freecycle pickup where someone leaves [an item] on their door handle, I\u2019d wind up talking with these people for an hour.\u201d\nFrasz had three yerdle exchanges with folks who work at Sungevity, where her partner just started a new job; her sharing with his coworkers made his social transition to a new company that much easier. Once, Frasz ended up telling a fellow yerdle user about the work she does reducing food waste. A few days later the woman called Frasz from a bakery that was about to toss four bags of bread. The two were able to meet up, save the bread from its dumpster fate, and donate it to a hunger-relief group.\nThis potential for real connection is key to the success of any sharing-economy platform, says Lauren Anderson, who runs Collaborative Consumption Hub, a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for information about sharing economies, with Rachel Botsman \u2014 the woman who literally wrote the book on the sharing economy. \u201cA lot of companies have failed because they haven\u2019t been able to evangelize the community around their idea,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though the platform could be global, people are generally interacting on a local level. Maintaining that local sense of connection is fundamental to the strength of that community.\u201d\nYerdle makes it extra easy to build community because no money exchanges hands. Instead, Frasz says, the service \u201csparks and perpetuates a gift economy.\u201d A woman taking some martini glasses off Frasz\u2019s hands showed up at her place with cookies. Frasz likes to bring rosemary and kale from her garden in exchange for what other people give her. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, but it\u2019s just fun,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone\u2019s giving you something you really like, and you have a few cookies or things from your garden to share, it makes the deal that much sweeter.\u201d\nStill, platforms like yerdle face a tricky problem of scale. On one hand, they want to maintain the sense of intimacy that will set them apart from the free section of Craigslist \u2014 once companies reach a certain scale, Anderson points out, they start attracting people \u201cwho don\u2019t have the same values.\u201d On the other hand, keep it too intimate, and you won\u2019t be able to build enough critical mass to actually be useful. \u201cIf somebody comes to your platform and they can\u2019t find what they\u2019re looking for instantly, chances are they\u2019re not going to come back a second time,\u201d Anderson says.\nSocial, mobile, and location-based technologies make it easier to \u201cretain the small nest within the big nest,\u201d as Anderson puts it. Yerdle\u2019s Facebook interface, for example, keeps exchanges confined to loose networks that already exist, increasing the chance that connections will carry on in real life.\nBut this gets back to the question of whether such platforms are even necessary in the first place. Why can\u2019t we just ask our friends if they have what we need? Why do we require some special technology to facilitate what used to be a basic component of social life?\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is, it\u2019s been a good 60 or 70 years since we really traded or exchanged [in that way],\u201d Anderson says, pointing out that breakdowns in neighborly trust began long before the internet, back when we started leaving small towns in droves and barricading ourselves behind the wheel and in front of the TV. \u201cWhat technology\u2019s done is [enabled] people to return to a manageable-size community. The isolation of the big city makes it hard to connect with like-minded people in an organic way outside your typical routine. Technology has allowed us to find people with shared interests in close proximity.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ve been exploring different aspects of the sharing economy here at Grist, I\u2019m starting to be convinced of exactly what Anderson is saying \u2014 that web platforms for sharing represent online networks at their best. Something like yerdle isn\u2019t designed to help us avoid social interaction, but rather to maximize, as Werbach puts it, our \u201cenormous capacity for generosity.\u201d\n}}

{{Facebook is working on an artist platform to be launched later this year, which in essence is supposed to be better than what MySpace allows with its platform, according to multiple sources I have spoken to since this morning after a slightly off-the-mark rumor came out earlier. The platform will allows bands and labels to create artists pages, and allow various widgets to be embedded for music promotion, organizing events, etc. Among those widgets would be iLike, the most popular app inside Facebook, but will also include iTunes widgets for sampling (to being with), and eventually buying music through Apple (NSDQ: AAPL). The service will still have the utilitarian sensibilities of the Facebook platform, the sources stress, rather than the more chaotic and flashy platform that MySpace has.\nFacebook has been making the rounds of music labels trying to get this service off the ground.\nFor now, this squarely takes on MySpace, not iTunes as the rumors said this morning. Facebook will have an actual deal with Apple, though it is conceivable down the line it could start selling music through the artists\u2019 platform.\nWhether users will gravitate towards Facebook from an already thriving and deep music community on MySpace is what remains to be seen.\n}}
{{Senate Republicans released their healthcare bill today. The most immediate response was a large demonstration at the offices of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who oversaw the bill's drafting in complete secrecy and will now attempt to ram it through the upper chamber, much like Speaker Paul Ryan forced his bill through the House before it could be scored by the CBO. One person we haven't heard much from through all this is former President Barack Obama, whose name Republicans slapped onto the Affordable Care Act as it became Enemy Number One in conservative ideology.\nRepeal and Replace Obamacare is the great piece of performance art nearing its conclusion, consequences be damned, but Obama finally weighed in today on his Facebook page in an attempt to convince his fellow citizens to bring a halt to the proceedings:\nTime will tell whether this ship has sailed, much like the first one did in 2010\u2014when Obama got his healthcare bill passed, and failed to make the case for it to the American people afterward.

{{SAN JOSE \u2014 Eric Murphy generally makes about $2,400 per month after taxes as a security guard at Facebook, but his dream right now is not to buy a home or even rent out a one-bedroom apartment in San Jose, which averages about $2,460 monthly.\nAll he wants is to move out of his East San Jose garage-turned-bedroom, which he splits with a roommate for $825 a month, and into something more homelike.\nMurphy was one of dozens of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) security officers who protested Friday outside Adobe headquarters in downtown San Jose. SEIU currently is negotiating a new contract with tech companies and contractors who assign security officers to the giant Silicon Valley campuses.\nMurphy says he routinely takes overtime shifts and works up to 80 hours a week to make ends meet. The 27-year-old is contracted through Allied Universal, whose health care premium, he says, was too expensive to enroll in. Instead, he gets health care through a heavily subsidized Covered California program.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.\nMurphy demanded that Facebook, Adobe and other companies pay their service workers enough to be able to afford rent, health care and basic needs in the Bay Area, especially as security officers are possibly put into more precarious positions after the YouTube headquarters shooting in April.\nContracted security officers for Silicon Valley campuses make anywhere from $15 an hour \u2014 San Jose\u2019s minimum wage salary starting next year \u2014 to $20 an hour at the very highest, according to SEIU spokesman Stephen Boardman.\n\u201cWe do not believe any Adobe employees or contractors of Adobe participated in today\u2019s demonstration,\u201d said an Adobe spokesperson.\nFacebook is not negotiating directly with SEIU.

She chooses to be homeless, she says, so she can afford to take care of her older brother, who is severely autistic. She says she pays for his room and for caretakers while she is at work.\nBecause her brother is regularly evicted due to his erratic behavior, Elizabeth says she loses the security deposit she puts down for him three or four times a year.

{{Canada's Privacy Commissioner has launched an investigation into changes Facebook made to its privacy policy. The changes were made in response to an investigation the Privacy Commissioner carried out last year.\nThe Commissioner will look into whether the changes actually worsened the situation, making it more likely for the private information of users to be published.\nThe Privacy Commissioner's office said that a number of people object to the changes introduced by the social networking giant. It said that this investigation was prompted by one particular complaint about the way that Facebook changed its privacy settings in December of last year.\n\"The complaint focuses on a tool introduced by Facebook in mid-December 2009, which required users to review their privacy settings,\" said the Commissioner's office in a statement. \"The complainant alleges that the new default settings would have made his information more readily available than the settings he had previously put in place.\"\nIn December Facebook did not actually change users' settings but did invite them to use a new tool for controlling their privacy settings. That tool's default position was to make quite a lot of information available to a wide network of Facebook users, and would have made more information available than was previously typically the case.\nWhile users could use the tool to restrict the spread of information, many users typically agree to accept the default settings chosen by the publishers of software and makers of web services.\n\u201cThe individual\u2019s complaint mirrors some of the concerns that our Office has heard and expressed to Facebook in recent months,\u201d said assistant commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who was responsible for last year's Facebook investigation.\n\u201cSome Facebook users are disappointed by certain changes being made to the site \u2013 changes that were supposed to strengthen their privacy and the protection of their personal information,\" she said.\nThe Commissioner's investigation last year found that Facebook was not clear enough about how users of the service could control access to their information and did not do enough to stop other companies accessing it.\nThe investigation found that information on how to change privacy settings and delete accounts was hard to find and confusing.\nFacebook's attempts to fix those problems, though, may have caused others. \"Changes to the site\u2019s privacy information, settings and tools have sparked criticism from users who feel that personal information posted to the site is, in some instances, even more exposed now than before,\" said the Commissioner's office.\nFacebook previously faced criticism over its failure to allow users to delete accounts. They could disable them but could not prevent their data staying on Facebook servers, present but invisible to the public.\nThe company then allowed deletion but faced further criticism for not making that option obvious enough and for putting it in a different part of the site to the account disabling function.\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this month that he believed that privacy was no longer a 'social norm'.\n\"People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that's evolved over time,\" he said in a speech at an electronics trade show.\n}}
{{Facebook says its inspection of computers turned over by Paul Ceglia, a New York man who claims he's entitled to 50 percent ownership of the social-networking giant, has turned up a \"smoking gun\" that shows Ceglia's lawsuit is a fraud based on fabricated evidence.\nCeglia claimed in a lawsuit filed last year against Facebook and its CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, that Zuckerberg entered into a contract with Ceglia in 2003 to design and develop the Web site that would ultimately become Facebook--a company now with an estimated value of more than $70 billion.\nZuckerberg and Facebook, who had previously called the alleged contract a \"cut-and-paste job,\" filed a discovery motion in June for the original contract, e-mails in native form, and inspection of all computers in Ceglia's possession, as well as those in his parents' house.\nThe inspection of those computers turned up \"embedded\" evidence that the alleged contract central to Ceglia's lawsuit was fabricated, the defendants said (see filing below).\nThe filing was one of two nearly identical memorandums of law that Facebook and Zuckerberg filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. However, the one made publicly available was heavily redacted and does not describe the defendants' alleged evidence of fraud \"because of Ceglia's egregious abuse of the confidentiality provisions in the joint stipulated protective order,\" Facebook said in its filing:\nCeglia has designated all 120 relevant documents and files that were found on his computers, CDs and floppy disks as containing \"confidential\" information that must be shielded from the public. He does not want the public to know what was discovered on his computers because it includes smoking-gun documents that conclusively establish that he fabricated the purported contract and that this entire lawsuit is a fraud and a lie.\nPaul Argentieri, Ceglia's longtime New York-based attorney, as well as the San Diego-based Lake law firm, which now also represents Ceglia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCeglia has said he hired Zuckerberg through a Craigslist ad to write code for a project called StreetFax and paid Zuckerberg $1,000 for coding work; he also allegedly invested $1,000 in Zuckerberg's The Face Book project, which gave him a 50 percent interest in the company as well as an additional 1 percent interest for every day after January 1, 2004, that The Face Book was delayed.\nIn a revised complaint filed in April, Ceglia cited more than a dozen e-mails purportedly between himself and Zuckerberg that detail discussions on design, development, business plans, and eventual contract disputes regarding what was then known as The Face Book.\nLast year, Ceglia produced a canceled check that he said proved he paid Zuckerberg $3,000 for some freelance software development work for a project called \"The Face Book.\" Facebook initially said it believed the contract was a \"likely\" forgery.

{{Facebook\u2019s next money-maker could be this tool for connecting marketers to social media creators so they can team up on sponsored-content Facebook ad campaigns. The Branded Content Matching search engine lets advertisers select the biographical characteristics of creators\u2019 fans they want to reach, see stats about these audiences, and contact them to hammer out deals.\nLeaked screenshots of Facebook\u2019s promotional materials for the tool were first attained and published in German by AllFacebook.de. TechCrunch has now confirmed with Facebook the existence of the test of the search engine. Facebook first vaguely noted it would build a creator-brand tool in March, but now we know what it looks like and exactly how it works.\nEven though Facebook will not actually broker or initially take a cut of the deals, the tool could equip brands with much more compelling and original marketing content. That could in turn encourage them to spend more on Facebook ads to spread that content, while also making more entertaining and tolerable the ads users see so they spend longer on the social network. By getting creators paid, even if not directly by Facebook, they\u2019ll invest more in the quality of their content and size of their following on the app instead of with competitors.\nHow Facebook\u2019s influencer marketing search engine works\nA Facebook spokesperson explained the motive behind the tool like this. Facebook wants to help businesses find creators who can reach their target audience in an authentic way, while allowing creators a path to monetizing their Facebook content and fan base. Creators opt in to participating in the test and set up a portfolio showcasing their audience size and metrics plus their best branded content. Facebook is starting the program primarily with a set of lifestyle brands and creators.\nAdvertisers in the test can search for creators with specific audience demographics using a wide range of targeting options. Those include both general and industry-specific parameters, like:\nTop countries where they\u2019re popular\nInterests\nGender\nEducation history\nRelationship status\nLife events\nHome ownership status\nHome type\nThe search engine\u2019s results page shows a list of creators with each\u2019s audience match percentage to the search terms, percentage of their followers they reach, engagement rate, follower count and video views. Advertisers can save their best matches to private lists, and reach out to contact the creators, though Facebook is still figuring out if it\u2019s best to connect them through their Facebook Page or traditional contact info. One question is how Facebook will ensure it\u2019s only connecting businesses to brand-safe creators who won\u2019t get them in trouble by posting racist, sexist or objectionable content the way star YouTuber PewDiePie did.\nThe deals for product placement or sponsored content creation and sharing are then worked out between the brand and creator without Facebook\u2019s involvement. The platform is not taking any revenue cut during the testing phase, but longer-term will evaluate whether it should. The only thing Facebook doesn\u2019t allow is pure re-sharing deals where influencers are paid to just post the brand\u2019s pre-made content they didn\u2019t help create.\nThe crowdsourced future of advertising\nForeshadowed in the launch of its dedicated Facebook Creator app in November, this is the company\u2019s first serious foray into influencer marketing. This emerging industry holds the potential to overhaul the way advertising content is produced. In days of old, brands couldn\u2019t target very narrow segments of their customers because they were using broadcast mediums like TV commercials, magazine ads and billboards, or endorsements from mainstream celebrities like movie actors. They might only make a few separate styles of marketing campaigns that would appeal to wide swaths of their target audience.\nWith the internet and targeting data-rich social networks like Facebook, they can reach extremely specific subsets of their customers with marketing messages tuned to their identity. But reaching these niche audiences with corporate content that feels authentic rather than fake and smarmy is difficult. That\u2019s where social media creators come in. Not only do they have a pre-existing and intimate relationship with their fans who\u2019ll take their endorsements to heart, they\u2019ve also already spent years figuring out exactly what type of content appeals to these specific people. When they team up with brands, the businesses get their products recontextualized and interpreted for that audience with content they could never come up with themselves.\nTwitter realized this early, which is why it acquired creator-brand deal broker Niche for a reported $50 million back in 2015. [Disclosure: I got fascinated with this industry because my cousin Darren Lachtman is one of the co-founders of Niche.] But now as Facebook seeks to attract influencers and their audiences to its social network, it\u2019s trying to find ways to get them paid. Otherwise, they\u2019re likely to stray to YouTube\u2019s ad revenue shares and Patreon\u2019s subscription payments. So far Facebook has tested tipping and subscriptions from fans, as well as letting creators host ad breaks \u2014 essentially commercials \u2014 during their videos. But brands want the creators\u2019 help designing the content, not just distributing it.\nBut what about Instagram and YouTube influencers?\nThe Branded Content Matching search engine will help brands find those creators\u2026 but only on Facebook for now. The tool doesn\u2019t pull in their audience sizes and metrics from other important platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat or Twitch. Brands don\u2019t get a holistic view of the value and reach of a creator, who might be way more popular on another platform than Facebook.\nAnd really, Instagram is where all these influencers spend their time and share their content. Though Facebook owns it, it says it\u2019s not showing Instagram influencers in the tool at the moment. Adding them in, the same way advertisers can push ads to Facebook and Instagram from one interface, would make the search engine much more powerful.\nThere\u2019s already a whole industry of independent creator search engines and databases for marketers like Hypr, Whalar, Fohr Card, Tap Influence and Creator IQ. If Facebook built one with first-party data from across its properties, or even pulled stats from competing platforms, it might squash these startups. Alternatively, it might buy one to ramp up its efforts here like how Twitter bought Niche.\nFacebook is running out of ad inventory in the News Feed. It needs to make each ad better and more watchable so it can grow revenue by charging more per ads rather than selling more ads. Meanwhile, yesterday it started testing ads in Facebook Stories, where brands will need help navigating the more personal, vertical video format. Awesome content made by creators could be the answer. And Facebook could finally start helping more of these artists, comedians and storytellers turn their passion into a profession.\n}}
{{The investigations into Russia's role in the 2016 election are threatening to pry the lid off tech companies' most prized possessions: the secret inner workings of their online platforms.\nAs the probes unfold into social media\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to show an interest in the mechanics of everything from how Facebook weights news items to how Google ranks search results. The questions, which echo European regulators\u2019 interventionist approach to technology, are a stark change for Silicon Valley companies accustomed to deference from U.S. officials on how they run their operations.\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned Sept. 24 about \"the use of Facebook's algorithms and the way it tends to potentially reinforce people's informational bias.\" He added, \"This is a far broader issue than Russia, but one that we really need to know more about.\"\nStory Continued Below\nA source close to the Senate Intelligence Committee said staff investigators are eager to learn whether Russian elements used Twitter to boost disinformation in Google's search rankings. While Google has previously said it uses Twitter and Facebook links in calculating search rankings for content, it hasn't revealed specifics on how social media mentions factor into its algorithm. Google is famously closemouthed about how its immensely valuable search engine works, only parceling out small clues over the years.\nCritics of the tech industry say the time has come for the companies to let policymakers take a closer look.\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

For one thing, the algorithms in some cases constitute the bulk of their assets \u2014 it\u2019s a big reason most people use Google\u2019s search engine instead of, say, Bing. Sharing them with a leak-prone Congress or executive branch agency could mean giving away a competitive advantage. The companies also argue that they often improve their products so quickly that stopping to document what they've done would slow technological progress.\n\"When it comes to something like a social network, trying to regulate by demanding companies turn over their intellectual property is going to have a dampening effect on innovation,\" said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. What's more, with platforms like Google and Facebook where people compete to get attention, \"they don't reveal exactly how it works because people would cheat,\" he said.\nSilicon Valley, though, has lately shown some signs of a willingness \u2014 however grudging \u2014 to explain more of how its inventions work. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in announcing changes to address foreign election meddling, said in a Sept. 21 announcement that his company will boost transparency by making it \"so you can visit an advertiser\u2019s page and see the ads they\u2019re currently running to any audience on Facebook.\u201d\nBut some technology experts say the companies could do much more.\n\"Technical shock-and-awe gets used as a political shield to prevent scrutiny of what's happening on these platforms,\" said David Robinson, co-founder of Upturn, a Washington, D.C.-based tech consulting firm.\n\"You often have a situation where a technologist goes to a bunch of policymakers and basically says: 'Don't worry your pretty little heads about the details of how this works. It's complicated and hard to explain,'\" said Robinson. \"But the parts that people care about aren't the hard parts to explain,\" he said, citing as an example how Facebook decides how to segment its audience for advertisers to target.\nThe notion that people should have more insight into how computer-driven decisions shape their lives has made headway in Europe, under the banner of the \"right of explanation.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last year that \"algorithms must be made more transparent, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen about questions like \u2018What influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?'\" And a sweeping law called the General Data Protection Regulation, set to take effect in the European Union in May, enshrines the standard that citizens deserve to know how algorithms make decisions that affect them.\nMeanwhile, European negotiators on the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield \u2014 a pact that allows American companies to move data across the Atlantic \u2014 want future versions to protect EU citizens from so-called automated decision-making.\nThe political landscape in the United States has grown rockier for Silicon Valley in recent months. But the most immediate risk for the industry is lawmakers seizing upon Washington's multiple Russia-related investigations to push through regulations that might not otherwise have gotten traction.\nCongressional offices have sometimes had their own parochial concerns about how social media work, and they have run into roadblocks when trying to learn more.\nIn one incident, the digital directors for a group of lawmakers expressed frustration to representatives of Facebook during the Obama era that the company's targeting tools made it difficult to reach their constituents, according to a source who requested anonymity because the discussions took place behind closed doors. The Facebook rep told the staffers that the company's algorithm gave points for original content and multimedia, but the rep offered nothing more, the source said.\n\"Beyond that, it is a complete mystery to us,\" the source said.\n}}

It is thought that up to 2.7 million EU citizens' data could have been involved in the Cambridge Analytica controversy.\nAnnouncing the news, Tajani said:\nThe founder and CEO of Facebook has accepted our invitation and will be in Brussels as soon as possible, hopefully already next week, to meet the leaders of the political groups and the Chair and the Rapporteur of the Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.\nHe went on to say:\nOur citizens deserve a full and detailed explanation. I welcome Mark Zuckerberg's decision to appear in person before the representatives of 500 million Europeans. It is a step in the right direction towards restoring confidence.\nThe president of the European Parliament also took to Twitter to make the announcement:\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO and founder, has accepted our invitation. He will come to the European Parliament. My full statement \u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/FdmuDPl8Wb \u2014 Antonio Tajani (@EP_President) May 16, 2018\nImage credit: Fandy design / Shutterstock\n}}
{{Ben Herold:\nWell, that's exactly right.\nI think there are millions of teenage users of Facebook, and for most part, the company treats them in the same way that it treats adults, particularly when it comes to the types of data it collects from them. That can include everything that a student uploads from Facebook, from their photos and posts and updates, everything they like on Facebook, everything they click on Facebook.\nFacebook is also able to know what kind of phone you're using and when you're using it. It can collect location data showing where you are and what kind of cell phone towers and Wi-Fi access points are nearby. Facebook can actually track our browsing history in many cases, not only for Facebook users, but for people who don't log into Facebook or don't have a Facebook account at all.\nAnd so there is a growing push within schools to try and do what they can to make students aware not just of their own practices, being good digital citizens and trying to be responsible with what they post to social media, but understanding this broader context in which data is collected and shared and used for all manner of purposes by all kinds of parties in ways that are often invisible to us.\nAnd I think the more that both educators and students and parents can understand that, the better off they will be.\n}}
{{A Texas man's Facebook post in which he describes his unconventional plan to ultimately retire at a Holiday Inn to avoid nursing-home costs is going viral.\n\"No nursing home for us,\" wrote Terry Robison of Spring in Harris County in a post that had since been shared nearly 123,000 times as of Wednesday evening. \"We'll be checking into a Holiday Inn!\"\nIn his Feb. 7 post, Robison said he'd checked on reservations at the Holiday Inn. With discounted senior and long-term stay rates, the total came to just over $59 a night \u2014 far less than the cost of a nursing home, which he pegged at $188 per day.\n\"They treat you like a customer, not a patient,\" wrote Robinson, whose Facebook shows he attended the University of Texas at Arlington. \"It takes months to get into decent nursing homes. Holiday Inn will take your reservation today.\"\nBesides, he noted, the hotel chain offers free breakfast, with some sites even offering afternoon happy hours. Other amenities include around-the-clock security, swimming pools, workout rooms, complimentary shampoo and soap, and \u2014 depending on the location \u2014 free airport shuttles.\n\"You're not stuck in one place forever,\" he said. \"You can move from Inn to Inn, or even from city to city. Want to see Hawaii? They have Holiday Inn there too.\"\nThe combined savings, he said, would leave plenty of monthly income left over for lunches and dinners, special TV movies and gratuities.\nRobison also noted that grandkids could likely make use of the hotel pool during family visits.\n\"There is a better way when we get old and feeble,\" he said. \"What more could I ask for? So, when I reach that golden age, I'll face it with a grin.\"\nLong-term hotel stays aren't unheard of.\nIn 2011, CNN reported that after living there for 10 years and becoming a pillar of the transient community, 79-year-old Joy Bricker finally checked out of a Marriott hotel in Falls Church, Va., to move in with her daughter.\n}}
{{The stock market continued its nearly straight-up streak of gains to begin 2018 on Friday, with major benchmarks climbing to a fresh set of records. Rises of between 0.5% and 1% were common among several popular indexes. Market participants reacted positively to earnings reports from major money center banks as a sign of what might be yet to come throughout the next month, when the bulk of large-cap companies will report their financial results for the past year and issue outlooks for 2018 and beyond. Yet despite the positive attitude on Wall Street, some stocks languished. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Aflac (NYSE:AFL), and GameStop (NYSE:GME) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.\nFacebook deals with fallout\nShares of Facebook declined 4.5% after the social media giant announced a strategic shift that some saw as potentially damaging to profits. Rather than emphasizing stories and other posts from publishers, advertisers, and other corporate interests, Facebook will return to its roots, re-emphasizing friends and family as an integral part of the social media experience. Investors fear that marketing clients will move away from the platform as a result, but those who like the stock would respond that initiatives like virtual reality are arguably far more important to Facebook's long-term success than incremental ad revenue on the company's namesake social media platform.\nAflac wrangles with reports\nAflac stock dropped 7% in the wake of reported allegations of insider trading, fraudulent sales, and financial manipulation. Aflac said that the claims made by what it called a small group of independent contractors were false, having done its own investigation of the claims and finding no merit to them. Yet the allegations paint a much different picture of the insurance giant, and despite the company's denials, the stock failed to recover much lost ground. With comparisons made to scandals at Wells Fargo, investors in Aflac are in no hurry to declare a premature end to the controversy.\nGameStop plays a losing hand\nFinally, shares of GameStop fell 11%. The video game retailer announced holiday sales results that showed solid increases, including same-store sales gains of nearly 12% from year-earlier figures. Hardware sales were particularly strong, but pre-owned sales suffered from greater interest in new titles. Yet the bad news for GameStop was that customers aren't upgrading mobile devices as quickly as anticipated, and that will force the company to take a $350 million to $400 million impairment charge in the holiday quarter. Concerns about GameStop's long-term viability linger, especially as video game companies move toward digital distribution business models that could cut out intermediary retailers entirely over time.\n}}

{{Microsoft announced today that it will be selling hundreds of patents to Facebook, a sign that it wants to protect its investment from litigation as the social network heads towards an IPO next month. But this wasn\u2019t a sudden change of heart.\nAccording to sources familiar with the deal, Microsoft and Facebook were hoping to partner on a $1 billion purchase of AOL patents, but the rules of the auction banned collaborative or consortium bids. So the companies did an end around, with Microsoft buying the patents for $1 billion and then striking a $550 million dollar deal with Facebook.\nThere are a lot of angles in play here. Yahoo sued Facebook, which set the social network off a hunt for patents. It bought some from IBM, then filed a countersuit against Yahoo. AOL, in the meantime, saw the Yahoo lawsuit, and wondered how it could get value of its patent portfolio. Rather than litigate, it decided to sell, eventually passing its IP to Microsoft for $1 billion.\nAOL, like Yahoo, had a broad portfolio of patents related to the rise of Web 1.0 technologies, many of which now seem foundational to the functioning of any internet business. There was also a broad swathe of proto-social patents that Yahoo and AOL can lay claim to, though, to quote The Social Network film, \u201cIf they had invented The Facebook, they would have invented the Facebook.\u201d\nMark Zuckerberg photo via John Adams on Flickr\n}}

{{Facebook just hit 2 billion monthly active users. Geez.\nLook, we all know Facebook is massive and growing, but that figure is still remarkable.

{{Instagram has a new leader.\nOn Monday, the company announced that Adam Mosseri will head Instagram effective immediately.

Most recently, he was Instagram's VP of product. In his new role, Mosseri will oversee \"all functions of the business\" and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations.\nBefore their departures, Systrom was CEO and Krieger was the chief technology officer.\nThe duo founded the photo-sharing app in a co-working space in 2010. It became a big hit, attracting tens of millions of users before the co-founders sold it to Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion.\nWith Facebook's backing, Instagram continued to grow and added new features like videos, disappearing posts and, most recently, a hub for long-form content called IGTV .

Facebook users in the US who are 18 and older started receiving reminders to 'Register Now' (pictured) at the top of their News Feed on Friday\n'We thought we had a unique ability and responsibility to show people this reminder that they should be checking their registration so they can participate in the election,' Katie Harbath, Facebook's director of government outreach, told the newspaper.\nBut this isn't the first time Facebook has used the power of social media to urge people to vote.\nThe company actually started in 2008 by posting reminders to head to their polling station on Election Day.\nFacebook experimented with a voter drive during the primaries earlier this year.\nIt's goal was to encourage people in individual states to register.\nIn this year's voter drive, close to 200,000 people registered to vote on the California Secretary of State's website, according to USA Today.\nThe social media giant said the reminder will be sent out over the next four days.

{{Facebook is planning to delay the release of its video chat device Portal, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg today. Previous reports stated that Facebook had planned to release a voice-controlled device that deploys facial recognition at its annual F8 conference on May 1-2 in San Jose, California.\nThe delay is reportedly the result of recent scandal surrounding the misuse of the data of 50 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal information from an academic who obtained it from the Facebook Platform in 2014.\nFacebook\u2019s knowledge of people\u2019s social activity could make it a unique player in the growing smart speaker market. Reports have been circulating since last summer that Facebook wants to debut a voice-controlled device with video chat. If true, such a delay would put Facebook even further behind potential competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.\nAccording to reports from Cheddar, the device would retail for $499 and come with a wide angle camera with facial recognition, a technology not likely to reduce people\u2019s privacy concerns with regard to Facebook. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in the article published today that the delay is happening so the device or devices can undergo additional review to ensure they make the right tradeoffs with user data.\nThe reported delay of Portal\u2019s release is the latest bad news for the world\u2019s biggest social media platform. On Monday, the company\u2019s stock dipped on news that the Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and Senator Chuck Grassley called for CEOs from Facebook, Twitter, and Google to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been invited to speak before multiple Congressional and U.K. parliamentary committees. Earlier today, CNN reported that Zuckerberg will testify before Congress soon.\nLast week, in addition to a trending #deletefacebook hashtag, Facebook saw opposition from Elon Musk, who ordered his companies SpaceX and Tesla to delete their Facebook pages, and WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton said it\u2019s time for people to delete their Facebook accounts just months after he left the company.\nIn response to the scandal, Facebook momentarily paused app reviews and pledged to audit all apps given access to large amounts of user data.\nAlexander Nix was removed from his position as Cambridge Analytica CEO last week. Days later, U.K. investigators raided Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London offices.\n}}
{{Yesterday, Facebook held a developer\u2019s garage event at their headquarters in Palo Alto. To kick things off, CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage to talk a bit about the history of Facebook. Notably, he focused on Facebook Photos as being a key catalyst that led to everything the social network is today.\nHe noted that when they launched the product, they didn\u2019t have all of the features that their competitors did. For example, they didn\u2019t have high-resolution photos and you couldn\u2019t print them. But one thing they did have was the social element \u2014 and this changed everything.\n\u201cThose features by themselves were more important than anything else combined,\u201d Zuckerberg said of the social elements of Facebook Photos. He then dropped the competitor bomb. \u201cThe photo product that we have is maybe five or six times more used than every other product on the web \u2014 combined,\u201d Zuckerberg stated.\nWow. Everyone knows Facebook Photos is huge, but if Zuckerberg\u2019s stats are accurate, it\u2019s becoming YouTube-level huge compared to their competitors. Of course, what he means by \u201cused\u201d isn\u2019t entirely clear \u2014 do they just browse more, or upload more as well? Either way, it\u2019s massive.\nAnd it was clear from both Zuckerberg and CTO Bret Taylor\u2019s talk at the event that photos to them was the harbinger of things that eventually came \u2014 and will still come.\nTaylor noted that he had been \u201cbrainwashed by Silicon Valley\u201d before he saw and understood the power of Facebook Photos (he was likely working at Google at the time). He had been thinking like an engineer about the best way to organize photos on the web. But he quickly realized that \u201cthe best possible organization of photos is around people,\u201d Taylor said.\n\u201cThere are ten other industries waiting to have this type of disruption,\u201d Taylor said noting the travel industry, e-commerce, and music as a few of them. Earlier, Zuckerberg agreed. Because of the social element, \u201cevery single vertical will be transformed.\u201d\n}}
{{Some of the users who went without Facebook were bale to maintain their abstinence after the study concluded. Photo: Getty Images\nDespite all the scandals of the past year, here we are, still on Facebook, a couple of billion of us spending about an hour a day in its iron grip. Now a new study suggests it's making us feel bad.\nThat's in part because we may be addicted. Want to feel better? Delete Facebook. As some experts have said, the system of rewards set up by Facebook and other social media platforms is akin to gambling or substance abuse cravings. Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive, explained that the thought process behind driving user engagement is akin to delivering \"a little dopamine hit\".\nAs with any habitual behaviour, you might reasonably expect that abstaining would lead to an improved mood and an overall sense of wellbeing. A new study goes a long way towards suggesting the benefits of cutting Facebook out of our lives altogether.\nThe study, titled The Welfare Effects of Social Media, from researchers at Stanford and NYU, is being praised as one of the most rigorous to look at what happens to people when they log off. Logging off seems to be as positive as you probably expect it would be, leading to increased subjective wellbeing, less political drama and attention span agitation, and increased time spent with friends and family. On the other hand, it also led to a decrease in awareness of the news. Although, to be honest, that sounds pretty nice, too.\nTo track social media's effects, the researchers recruited 2844 Facebook users, then randomly assigned half of them the task of temporarily deactivating their accounts for a month. To ensure compliance, subjects were paid for their efforts, and their accounts were monitored to make sure they were not scrolling their timeline on the sly. The authors checked in with them regularly via text to see how they were feeling during the cleanse.\n\"Deactivation caused small but significant improvements in wellbeing, and in particular on self-reported happiness, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety,\" they concluded. \"Effects on subjective wellbeing as measured by responses to brief daily text messages are positive but not significant.\"\nFurthermore, some of the users who went without Facebook were able to maintain their abstinence after the study concluded.\nThe study acknowledges there are, clearly, benefits to Facebook and social media at large. Facebook is still, for all its faults, an important means for people to stay connected to friends and family and as a source of information, community, and entertainment, particularly for those who are otherwise socially isolated.\nBut, they conclude: \"Our results also make clear that the downsides are real.\n\"We find that four weeks without Facebook improves subjective wellbeing and substantially reduces post-experiment demand, suggesting that forces such as addiction and projection bias may cause people to use Facebook more than they otherwise would.\" - Guardian News and Media\n}}
{{Mark Zuckerberg refuted a Reuters story yesterday that said Facebook would not bring Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation privacy safeguards around the world. \u201cOverall I think regulations like this are very positive\u201d Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters today. \u201cWe intend to make all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe.\u201d\nZuckerberg noted that \u201cIs it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We\u2019ll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places. But let me repeat this, we\u2019re going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.\u201d\nHowever, some critics believe that adding GDPR \u201ccontrols and settings\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean also implement GDPR\u2019s rules acround data control, consent, data portability, the right to be forgotten, and the right to know how your data is being processed. The question is whether Zuckerberg\u2019s careful wording will let Facebook offer fewer privacy protections everywhere than GDPR mandates, or whether he truly means all of GDPR will be applied globally.\n[Update: 3pm Pacific: A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch that Facebook does have plans to comply with GDPR\u2019s data privacy rules around the world, not just provide GDPR \u201ccontrols and settings\u201d as Zuckerberg mentioned. For example, Facebook offers the Download Your Information option globally to comply with data portability rules, updated its Data Use Policy today with details on collection practices to comply with the right to know how your data is being processed, and provides opt-outs to comply with consent rules.\nFacebook says that some laws elsewhere in the world conflict with GDPR\u2019s new laws for Europe so they can\u2019t be extended everywhere, and that the interface for some of these tools may vary. But overall it seems that Facebook is intent on bringing the same privacy and control afforded by GDPR to everyone.]\nGDPR goes into effect on May 25th, and places requirements on data controllers, forcing them to explain to people what personal data they intend to collect and why. It\u2019s focused around consent. Facebook has made its own moves to boost consent for ad targeting. TechCrunch reported that Facebook plans to implement a Custom Audiences Certification Tool that will require businesses to pledge that they had the consent to collect user email addresses and phone numbers that they\u2019re uploading to Facebook for ad targeting.\nGDPR also lets users request a copy of their personal information free-of-charge and get a response within a month. It gives people the right to not be subject to significant decisions by businesses that impact their privacy. Users also have some rights to erase their personal data if they withdraw consent or it\u2019s no longer necessary for the reason it was collected. Violations can trigger hefty fines.\nZuckerberg\u2019s statements indicate that the progressive, privacy-first legislation passed in the European Union will benefit everyone. The inability to make unilateral changes to people\u2019s privacy and the right to erasure could hamper some of Facebook\u2019s ability to roll out new products and require it to build stronger systems to comply with user requests. But given how much Facebook earns from our data, making it jump through some hoops to give users more agency seems like a reasonable tradeoff.\nFor more on GDPR, check out our explainer:\n}}
{{As predicted, developers can now build bots inside Facebook Messenger.\nThe announcement was one of the highlights of Facebook\u2019s jam-packed F8 schedule and it further proves what many have been predicting for a long time, bots are the future.\nRight now, the bots that are available are more limited \u2013 and the discovery process isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 but it\u2019s clear now, more than ever, that bots make a lot of sense.\nBeyond that, Messenger\u2019s bot strategy speaks to a few realities of modern computing and communication.\nDon\u2019t make me talk to you on the phone\nLike many millenials, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time on the phone. I talk to sources and companies for my job, but most of my personal communication takes place through text (or if I\u2019m feeling especially outgoing, Snapchat).\nWith text, I can maintain a number of conversations at once \u2013 and I can reply asynchronously. Increasingly, when I do get on the phone \u2013 and it\u2019s not for work \u2013 I find myself talking to customer service agents, where the experience often leaves a lot to be desired.\nIn his keynote demonstration of Messenger bots, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out the perks of using the 1\u2013800-Flowers bot to order flowers, as opposed to actually having to speak to a florist to arrange a delivery.\nA few weeks ago, I had an issue with one of my credit cards. My bank reached out to me over text, but I still had to call in to confirm that I actually did buy a rose gold iPad. While waiting on hold to talk to a human, my bank told me I could do this whole process online.\nNow, this wasn\u2019t actually true because the website kept telling me I had to call the bank \u2013 but the point remains that many of the reasons I would call a bank (like to check a balance or to confirm the validity of a transaction) are things that can be done through bots. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m happy that my bank, Bank of America, is going to have its own Messenger bot. Maybe next time I buy an iPad I can confirm the purchase there, rather than having to call in.\nThis is one of the services Zendesk and Salesforce are counting on. The customer service-focused companies plan to link bot functionality with their existing backends.\nThat opens up potential down the line for custom interactions \u2013 provided of course, users respond to bots the way Facebook and other companies think they will.\nApps aren\u2019t dead, but app fatigue is real\nAs Mashable App Reporter Karissa Bell astutely pointed out, one of the solutions Facebook seems to be trying to solve with its new bot platform is the issue of app fatigue and app engagement.\nApps aren\u2019t dead, but app fatigue is a very real thing. The problem many companies face today is actually getting users to download and install their app.\nWhat (I think) Marcus is getting at is app fatigue is real and ppl (read: millenials) hate phone calls so bots are the next best option #F8 \u2014 Karissa Bell (@karissabe) April 12, 2016\nAnd Facebook understands that. Don't get me wrong, apps themselves aren't going away, but apps don't have the appeal they once did \u2014 for developers or users.\n'There's an app for that' is still true, but installing apps can be a pain\nApple\u2019s mantra of \u201cthere\u2019s an app for that\u201d is still true, but it\u2019s also true that fewer users want to go through the hassle of installing your app.\nUsers don't want to install an app and for developers, even getting users to find or discover their app can be a nightmare. Standing out amongst millions of apps is difficult and it isn't getting any easier.\nFor years, Facebook has worked to make its core app work better with other apps \u2013 but you still had to have those apps installed. Bots change that paradigm. To use the Poncho weatherbot, I don\u2019t need to have the Poncho iOS app installed. The same is true for the various commerce bots.\nIn this way, at least right now, the barrier to entry of actually engaging with those services is now lower than it has ever been. For commerce brands \u2013 who have struggled to get users to use their apps \u2013 this could help make the experience more seamless.\nA seamless experience is usually also a more engaged experience, and Facebook lives and dies on engagement.\nI can't help but see Tuesday's announcement's as Facebook trying to push developers away from standalone mobile apps and toward building bots.\nOf course, it\u2019s important to understand that even if Facebook is trying to kill the app metaphor, developers still need to build an app \u2014 or at least, the backend of an app.\nLike an app, a bot has backend services that call certain functions and can lead to other calls. It may not be as advanced as a standalone app and its UI and UX are different, but this is still an app. It\u2019s just that the logic is running remotely on the cloud and not locally on a phone.\nSecurity and spam concerns\nImage: Facebook\nCompanies are quick to jump on the bot train in hopes of building greater engagement with users. Of course, users might not always want that engagement.\nDuring F8, Facebook\u2019s VP of Messaging Products David Marcus was quick to point out that there is block functionality built into the product \u2013 so that you can shut off a bot that becomes annoying. But it\u2019s not clear what \u2013 if anything \u2013 Facebook will do to discourage bots from behaving in a way that is overly intrusive or annoying.\nIn an interview with Mashable's Bell at F8, Messenger Director of Product Management Peter Martinazzi said that \u201cwe want to make sure you\u2019re really in control of what interactions are happening.\u201d\nOf course, a secondary concern to spam is security.\nA secondary concern to spam is security\nFacebook itself may protect the information you give it, but there is always a risk with opening a platform to other parties. How those parties use that information is something users have to be cognizant of.\nIt would be a nightmare scenario for Facebook to have bots appear that phished information from users or scammed them in other ways.\nMartinazzi said Facebook has \u201ca lot of [security] policies\u201d in place for bots and that those policies are \u201cone of the main reasons [bots] are rolling out slowly right now.\u201d He says that the reason this is starting as a beta is because \u201cwe want to make sure we have the best ways to enforce violations as they come up.\u201d\nThat\u2019s also one of the reasons that right now, the process of actually using a Messenger bot is more user-driven. Users have to initiate interactions with a business.\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but we still have questions about how Facebook will enforce data retention and treatment policies amongst its developers.\nPlus, even though users have to initiate threads with bots now, that won't always be the case. The promise of bots is that they can interact with us, too. If I always have to open up a separate chat to engage with a bot, I might as well just open up an app. I understand the need to keep things separate in the beginning, but eventually, this will change. Facebook needs to make sure it has the right tools and policies in place to protect its users.\nRight now, developers who build for the platform are vetted \u2013 though Facebook wouldn\u2019t tell us exactly how that works. There is a trade-off between getting as many developers to build for your platform as possible and making sure that the bots they build aren\u2019t violating any policies.\nWe\u2019re early in this process and I don\u2019t want to caution users against engaging with bots but I do think that security is a topic that needs more discussion. I also think Facebook needs to be very clear with its policies about what kind of behavior will be banned.\nSecurity is a topic that needs more discussion.\nBecause nothing will kill a bot revolution faster than all bots turning into spam.\nWill anyone use this?\nI\u2019m excited about bots. I think they can change and automate the way things are done. The customer service implications are obvious \u2013 but I also see bots as a new language for building new kinds of apps.\nThat said, there an unanswered question: Do users actually want to engage this way?\nThe trick with bots is to make the experience serendipitous and useful. If I have to ask a bot too many questions or phrase things in a certain way to get an expected result, I might as well just open an app or my web browser and perform the task the old-fashioned way.\nBut the promise of bots \u2013 that paired with natural language processing and AI \u2013 is that the a-ha experience I get with Amazon Alexa will be visible in my favorite chat app.\nI, for one, welcome our new bot overlords.\nKarissa Bell contributed to this article.\nHave something to add to this story?

{{PRINEVILLE, Oregon \u2014 Tucked deep in a Facebook data center, amid hundreds of humming server racks, nearly 2,000 smartphones are running some version of a Facebook app.\nSome are scrolling through the News Feed, Facebook's notoriously algorithmic and somehow always-controversial stream of updates from its users. Other devices are launching Messenger, the spin-off messaging app Facebook made a requirement for users about two years ago. Some of the phones are rebooting. At least one is scrolling through Lady Gaga's official Facebook page.\nThe phones are part of Facebook's Mobile Device Lab, a new system the company is using to test the performance of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and the company's other apps. The goal? To ensure updates and features Facebook is testing at its Menlo Park headquarters won't break the app when they get pushed out to the company's 1.6 billion users \u2014 including ones using four-year-old devices half a world away.\nIn total, Prineville has about 60 racks, each containing 32 smartphones, mounted on boards behind layers of insulation. Most of the phones themselves are a at least a year old, and some are significantly older. Some represent cutting-edge smartphone tech from half a decade ago: the iPhone 4S, Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 5 are all there. In each rack, above the tangle of cables and phones, sits a camera, recording every onscreen movement in case a developer needs to review a specific hiccup.\nFacebook's Mobile Device Lab at its Prinveille, Oregon, data center. Image: Facebook\n\"When a developer makes a change to one of the mobile applications, we take that change, we build the app with the change, and then we install it on one of the devices that are here and we run the app while collecting metrics,\" explains Facebook production engineer Antoine Reversat.\nIf the update negatively impacts a device's memory usage, battery life or the performance of the app, like slowing down News Feed scrolling, then it's sent back to the developer for a fix before the update can be pushed live.\nThe whole point is to go fast, we have to get better quickly\nThe setup is an important one for Facebook, which is aggressively pursuing users in developing countries \u2014 many of whom are using older devices and operating systems \u2014 as it looks to get its next billion users online. At stake is much more than a few app crashes or bug reports. The elaborate testing setup helps Facebook push performance-enhancing updates faster, which could be the difference between whether or not a frustrated user deletes the Facebook app from their phone after noticing it's a battery hog.\n\"The whole point is to go fast; we have to get better quickly,\" says Ken Patchett, Facebook's Director of Western Data Center Operations\nRight now the Mobile Device Lab is only looking at how updates affect each app's performance while on Wi-Fi networks. But this eventually could grow to include how they perform while on reduced network speeds \u2014 an issue that is particularly important to the company as it looks to grow its presence un developing markets.\n\"That's sort of the next step,\" Reversat says.\nFacebook's Mobile Device Lab at its Prineville, Oregon, data center. Each rack has 32 phones in it. Image: Mashable/Karissa bell\nBesides device testing, Facebook's sprawling Prineville facility is also home to one of the social network's biggest artificial intelligence projects: the hardware Facebook has designed specifically for machine learning, also known as Big Sur.\nAt first glance, Big Sur doesn't look much different than what's inside other racks in the data center. But inside are eight powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) that allow Facebook to train its artificial intelligence at previously unprecedented speeds.\nBig Sur is used to train neural networks \u2014 a type of AI that learns from data much the same way as the human brain does. Previously, the development of a single neural network could take weeks or even months, depending on the hardware setup. With Big Sur, Facebook has cut that time down to less than a day.\nFacebook's Big Sur at its Prineville data center. Image: Facebook\nIf you're a Facebook user, chances are you are already experiencing the benefits of this. Big Sur helps power the social network's real-time translations and photo-recognition abilities \u2014 where Facebook actually describes what's in a photo instead of relying solely on tagging and user-written captions, which are often notoriously unspecific. Visually impaired users experience this through the app's ability to recognize photos and read what's in them.\nIn the future, Big Sur could be used for even more ambitious AI projects. The field is increasingly moving toward something called unsupervised learning \u2014 a type of AI that's able to learn from data on its own \u2014 which could have even bigger implications for how Facebook uses artificial intelligence in its products.\n}}
{{INDIA: Did you know that popular social networking pages like Facebook, LinkedIn were frequently faked by cybercriminals to try and steal personal data via phishing attacks? Reports suggest that fake Facebook sites alone accounted for 60% of social network phishing in early 2018.\nKaspersky Lab\u2019s report suggests that in Q1 2018, Facebook also led the social network phishing category, followed by VK \u2013 a Russian online social networking service and LinkedIn. Facebook was also one of the top three targets for phishing overall, followed by Microsoft and PayPal.\nThe reason for this is likely to be the worldwide 2.13 billion active monthly Facebook users, including those who log in to unknown apps using their Facebook credentials, thereby granting access to their accounts. This makes unwary Facebook users a profitable target for cybercriminals carrying out phishing attacks.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhat is social network phishing and how to avoid becoming a prey to it\nSocial network phishing is a form of cybercrime that involves the theft of personal data from a victim\u2019s social network account. The fraudster creates a copy of a social networking website (such as a fake Facebook page), and tries to lure unsuspecting victims to it, forcing them to give up their personal data \u2013 such as their name, password, credit card number, PIN code, and more \u2013 in the process.\nCybercriminals are constantly searching for new methods to hit users, so it\u2019s important to be aware of fraudster techniques to avoid becoming the next target. So what users need to do in order to protect themselves from phishing? Here\u2019s what Kaspersky Lab experts advise:\n-Always check the link address and even better, don\u2019t click the link, but type it into your browser\u2019s address line instead.\n-Before clicking any link, check if the link address shown, is the same as the actual hyperlink (the real address the link will take you to) \u2013 this can be checked by hovering your mouse over the link.\n-Only use a secure connection, especially when you visit sensitive websites. As a minimum precaution, do not use unknown or public Wi-Fi without a password protection. For maximum protection, use VPN solutions that encrypt your traffic. And remember: if you are using an insecure connection, cybercriminals can invisibly redirect you to phishing pages.\n-Check the HTTPS connection and domain name when you open a webpage. This is especially important when you are using websites which contain sensitive data \u2013 such as sites for online banking, online shops, email, social media sites etc.\n-Never share your sensitive data, such as logins and passwords, bank card data etc., with a third party. Official companies will never ask for such data.\n}}
{{0 Facebook says outages due to 'server configuration change'\n- Facebook went down for almost a full day across parts of North America and Europe, but it's still not saying exactly what happened.\nAll the social network said Thursday was that the outages, which affected users and advertisers worldwide, resulted from a \"server configuration change.\" It offered no further details.\nFacebook and its apps - Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp - started experiencing problems midday Wednesday on the U.S. East Coast. Facebook was still having sporadic issues Thursday morning.\nFacebook did not say how many users were affected or why the outage took so long to fix. In a tweet about 24 hours after the problems began, Facebook apologized and thanked people for their patience. It didn't elaborate on the server change.\nThe outage is yet another publicity problem for a company already dealing with privacy issues and regulatory probes .\nThe disruption isn't likely to hurt advertisers much, since they usually pay for ads per click or impression. But they lose potential customers who might have seen their ads when the site and apps were down. Longer term, Facebook's reputation with advertisers and investors could be damaged, said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives.\nIt didn't help that it took Facebook so long to explain what was going on, he said. Facebook said on Wednesday that the problem was not related to a \"distributed denial of service\" or DDoS attack, a type of attack that hackers use to interrupt service to a site, but didn't provide any other details until Thursday.\n\"In these situations a lack of transparency is not a good look,\" Ives said. \"The longer something like this lasts, the more questions there are.\"\nThe disruption seemed spotty, with some apps and parts of the apps working for some but not others. While some less active users may not have noticed that Facebook services were down, other frequent users and advertisers keenly felt its absence.\nThe Drummers Garden Center & Floral, a plant store in Mankato, Minnesota, was unable to hold a live video Q&A on Facebook that it had planned for weeks. Customers and employees were both confused.\n\"I hope our customers aren't upset that we couldn't communicate with them. We're not used to it being down,\" said Jackie Karsten, the marketing coordinator for the store. She said two people called the store to ask if they were doing something wrong on their end. The Q&A has been rescheduled for Monday - which the store announced in a post to its Facebook page.\nMany users had a ready outlet for their frustrations: Twitter. Social media power user U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, lamented the lack of Instagram Wednesday evening on Twitter. \"Is Instagram still down? Bc after 2 months almost furnitureless in DC I am trying to take you all on the riveting adventure of getting: a chair,\" she tweeted with a smiley face emoji.\nUsers have learned to take social media breakdowns in stride, said Tim Bajarin, president of consultancy Creative Strategies.\n\"People have dealt with these types of outages for some time now,\" he said. \"While they are annoying, it has happened enough that a lot of people are now conditioned to roll with the punches.\"\nSteve Jones, a professor of communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the fallout might have been far different if the outage took place ahead of or during a major news event, like an election.\n\"If today were the day before the next presidential election, how would we hold Facebook accountable for an outage with regard to an electoral outcome?\" he asked. \"We're not going to redo an election.\"\n___\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Freestone is an employee of Bigge Crane and Rigging Co. of San Leandro.\nAs a result of the incident, Bigge Crane and Rigging Co. released two statements on Facebook Saturday. Initially the company was only aware of Freeman\u2019s role in the events, and he was removed from the Camp Fire recovery effort.\n\u201cBigge Crane and Rigging Co. regrets the insensitive and reprehensible actions of Mr. Rob Freestone,\u201d the company posted.\nLater the company discovered other employees were involved as well.\nThe employment of three workers have been terminated, Bigge said in another Facebook post Saturday evening. The company also expressed its support for Paradise and Butte County.\nThe Paradise Police Department did not return a call by deadline Sunday on the status of its investigation and whether it would forward the case to the District Attorney\u2019s Office seeking criminal charges.\n}}
{{Technology has changed the music industry (for better or worse) at its core. But along with the rise of digital audio and innovations like livestreaming, there came some challenges.\nWith livestreaming, it's delay. There are always a few brief moments of nothingness when you decide to go live on Facebook, and the band The Academic decided to use that delay to record loops for a performance of their song \"Bear Claws.\nThe song blew up, receiving over 1.2 million views in just a week. We were able to catch up with the band, to get a behind the scenes look at how the band was able to create the rendition of this song.\nI would love to know how this idea came about?\nWe love technology and we obviously love music and we wanted to find something that could bring both together. We came across a little hack that uses a Facebook Live stream in a way that Facebook themselves never intended. We thought how cool would it be if we can turn Facebook Live into a video and audio sampler. Musically, it\u2019s very similar to using a loop pedal \u2013 you stack layers of the same length on top of each other, indefinitely. The cool thing is the video picture loops too, so you\u2019re building both loops simultaneously \u2013 live, within the Facebook platform.\nWhat was the hardest part about recording the live loop?\nIt probably looks a lot easier than it actually was. The hardest part about it? The timing! We had one take to make sure that we were completely in sync with each other. If a single beat, part or note was missed, that mistake would obviously loop for the whole video and it would have been a mess.\nHow much planning did it take?\nWe took a bit of time to plan the song arrangement and work out some of the choreography but we only had one shot to make it work as a live take.\nHow did you plan it?\nWe tried to arrange the song in an interesting way. Introducing instruments and vocal hooks First that are not prominent and don't make much sense until the end. For example introducing the drums towards the end gives the ending some explosiveness!\nWhat has the feedback been like?\nThe reaction has been crazy. We knew we had created something that had never been done before and we had hoped it would get a good reaction but not to the extent of interest the video has generated. We have had hundreds of messages from around the world which has mind-blowing.\n}}

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n(Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc fell 2 percent on Tuesday, after a report that a federal probe on the data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica had been broadened and would include more government agencies.\nFacebook shares were down 2 percent at $193.36 in early trading on the Nasdaq, erasing nearly $12 billion from the company\u2019s market valuation.\nThe stock lost about 18 percent of its value in the seven trading days after the data scandal broke, but has since gained about 27 percent to date.\nFacebook has faced intense scrutiny around the Cambridge scandal, which saw millions of users\u2019 data improperly accessed by the political consultancy.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have joined the Department of Justice in its inquiries about the two companies and the sharing of personal information of 71 million Americans, the Washington Post reported citing five people.\nA Facebook spokesperson told Reuters late on Monday that it is cooperating with officials in the U.S., UK and beyond.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues,\u201d the spokesperson said.

{{Workplace, the version of Facebook tailored to enterprises that has over 30,000 organizations as paying customers, is ramping up the service today with a rush of new features to help it competes with the likes of Slack and Microsoft\u2019s Teams.\nThe additions are being announced at a new, standalone conference called Flow \u2014 the first time Facebook has built what\u2019s likely to become a recurring event for a specific product, Workplace\u2019s head Julien Codorniou told me in an interview. He described Workplace as \u201cFacebook\u2019s first SaaS startup.\u201d He tells us that for existing clients, the goal of Flow is to show off new features that deepen employee engagement with Workplace so they can\u2019t imagine switching away. And for enterprise software partners Facebook integrates with, it\u2019s to foster an ecosystem surrounding Workplace so it can adapt to any business.\nIn a big upgrade to the \u201cchat\u201d features of Workplace (conversations that happen outside the news feed, first launched last year), users will now be able to start chats, calls and video conversations either one-to-one or in groups, in the style of WhatsApp or Messenger. Facebook is also making it easier to navigate through high volumes of messages in your channels by adding in replies, do not disturb and pinning features \u2014 Facebook\u2019s first move to bring in algorithmic sorting to Workplace. And Facebook is also bringing its Safety Check feature from the main app to Workplace, delivered via Workchat, as a tool that can be controlled by admins to check on the status of employees during a critical incident.\nWorkplace has picked up 30,000 businesses as customers in the two years since it launched (including some biggies like Walmart, the world\u2019s largest employer); and today it also added a couple of notable large enterprises to the mix: GSK, Astra Zeneca, Chevron, Kantar, Telefonica, Securitas, Clarins UK, Jumia and GRAB.\nBut Facebook has never revealed how many users (or \u201cseats\u201d, in enterprise parlance) it has on Workplace. As a point of comparison, Slack today has 8 million users across 70,000 organizations, and Facebook hasn\u2019t updated its 30,000 figure in a year.\nThe range of features Facebook is introducing today are notable both for their breadth and for what they are aiming to do. Some help put Workplace more on par with the core Facebook experience in terms of functionality, but ultimately they are all squarely aimed at making Workplace into something that fits more closely with how enterprises already use IT.\nThe chat features that are being incorporated build on the minimal chat features that were already present in Workplace and essentially create something like WhatsApp or Messenger that sits within the same secure framework as Workplace itself. It\u2019s effectively Facebook\u2019s first step forward into unified communications \u2014 a specific branch of enterprise IT that used to be centred around PBXs and other expensive physical equipment, but has more recently become more virtualised with the rise of voice of IP and cloud-based systems that can be used over any internet connection.\nWorkplace had already had a feature in place for up to 50 companies to converse in multi-organizational conversations on the platform, and now if some members of those groups want to take the conversation to a more direct channel potentially with voice or video calling, they can do that directly from within the app without having to open a separate messaging client (which may or may not be under the control of IT). Up to 50 people can join a video call in Workplace.\nThe three features that help you better organise your conversations \u2014 do not disturb, replies and pinning important items \u2014 will be especially welcome to people who have especially \u201cnoisy\u201d channels on Workplace.\nReplies, Codorniou said, will work \u201clike on WhatsApp\u201d \u2014 where you can select a message and reply to it and it will appear with its mini thread later in the feed.\nBut they are perhaps most notable of all because they will be the first time that Facebook is introducing \u201calgorithmic\u201d sorting to Workplace. For those who already use normal Facebook, or Twitter, or other social media services, algorithmic sorting is something that is well-known, as it plays with the sequence of posts to show you what is deemed to be more important, versus what\u2019s most recent.\nIn the case of pinning, Facebook is letting the IT admins, and users, effectively play a part in the algorithmic sorting: Admins can pin \u201cimportant\u201d posts to the top of a feed, and that will affect what users see and can respond to first. \u201cIf the CEO posts a message, this might be more important than something posted an intern,\u201d he said.\nDo not disturb, meanwhile, will let users set times when they do not get pinged with messages, but when you \u201creturn\u201d again to Workplace, Facebook decides what gets sorted to the top of what you view.\nCodorniou notes that Facebook uses machine learning and AI \u201cto make sure that if you don\u2019t use Workplace for two weeks [as an example] you have the most relevant information on top of the news feed.\u201d Signals that it uses to sort include who you work with, and which groups you are most active in. \u201cIt\u2019s algorithmic by default,\u201d he noted, and added that this was something that was requested by Workplace users. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe in the chronological feed anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to guarantee reach to communications teams.\u201d\nThe Safety Check also fits into this concept. Here, Facebook will be putting IT managers/Workplace admins into the driver\u2019s seat, \u201cgiving them the keys to the feature\u201d, said Codorniou, and letting them control the use and distribution of a feature that in regular Facebook is controlled by Facebook itself.\nFrederic takes a deeper diver into Safety Check here, but the main idea, as Codorniou described it to me, is that it allows companies \u201cto track and clear who is safe and who is not\u201d when a particular location has been through an emergency or critical incident. There are apps that companies can use to run safety checks, or sometimes they might use SMS, but these tend to work more manually and are harder to execute quickly, he said. Facebook doesn\u2019t reveal how well penetrated their apps are at organizations like Walmart and Starbucks, but this potentially becomes one lever to helping get Workplace distributed more widely.\n\u201cEmployees are a company\u2019s number-one asset of the company, and this helps make sure you are safe,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to play Candy Crush, but things like Live\u201d \u2014 which Workplace launched last year \u2014 \u201cand Safety Check are relevant. They help turn companies into communities.\u201d\n(Community, of course, is the big theme for Facebook these days.)\nAll these updates are happening at a time when many people have been scrutinising Facebook for its approach to user privacy and personal data.\nThe issue was notably highlighted over the Cambridge Analytica scandal many months ago, specifically over how third parties were able to access users\u2019 information; and then more recently Facebook faced criticism two weeks ago, when it emerged that a bug in one of its features exposed user information to malicious hackers. Both of these problems were squarely about Facebook\u2019s core consumer app, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of an impact it has had on the company\u2019s enterprise business \u2014 given that levels of security in workplace networks typically tend to be higher as they are connected to corporate information.\n\u201cWe had a few questions of course but we have no reason to believe that Workplace was affected,\u201d Codorniou said. He noted that there had once been a feature to log in to Workplace using a user\u2019s Facebook ID, but that was disabled some time go. \u201cWe have been investigating, but most customers are on single sign on,\u201d he noted, which uses services like Okta, One Login and Ping to connect and sign in employees to their Workplace spaces.\nFacebook\u2019s scale brings it huge advantages in the enterprise. The consumerization of the office stack means Facebook can easily port over its familiar features. It\u2019s big enough to extensively dogfood Workplace within the company. And it already has advertising relationships with many of the world\u2019s top brands. But being a tech giant comes with the associated scandals and constant criticism. Facebook will have to convince business leaders that its social troubles won\u2019t muddy their suits.\n}}
{{The modified Fifa logo might have been a bit of a giveaway\nFacebook users were warned to be on their guard against scammers today after it emerged that 150,000 people were taken in by a Facebook FIFA World Cup 2010 group on the site which was set up by an online mischief-maker, or 'troll'.\nThe user set up the group at the beginning of the tournament, facilitating numerous discussions throughout the month-long event which attracted a large following, and chose the final whistle of the World Cup final to spring his surprise.\n\"Well, the 2010 FIFA World Cup is over and thank f**k for that, because I F***ING HATE FOOTBALL,\" he wrote on the site's wall.\n\"Made a s**t-load of money out of this page and you dumb twats and had a good time trolling you, too; so I'd like to thank you all.\"\nTrend Micro senior security advisor Rik Ferguson warned that, although the hoaxer appears to have had no criminal intent, the incident proves that people need to be less trusting on social networking sites.\n\"We take things at face value when maybe we shouldn't.

{{During a keynote at the 2019 Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit in San Jose, Facebook today debuted Minipack, a modular whitebox network switch platform it claims is the first of its kind with an \u201copen\u201d design.\n\u201cWe are excited to work with the community to develop an ecosystem around Minipack,\u201d said director of engineering at Facebook Hans-Juergen Schmidtke in a statement. \u201c[It\u2019s] the next generation of open, modular switch platforms that is more flexible, scalable and efficient for modern data centers.\u201d\nThe Minipack AS8000 Switch \u2014 which was developed by Edgecore Networks, the division of Accton Technology specializing in traditional and open network solutions \u2014 is based on Broadcom\u2019s StrataXGS Tomahawk III Switch Series, but occupies a smaller footprint while delivering more compute power at a lower price point. It supports a mix of 100G and 400G Ethernet interfaces up to a maximum of 128 100G or 32 400G ports, and packs Broadcom\u2019s Tomahawk III chips, which Broadcom claims are the highest-performing switch silicon on the market.\nCumulus Linux, a Linux-based network operating system developed and maintained by Mountain View, California\u2019s Cumulus Networks, will be the first to support the Minipack fully. As on existing switches, Cumulus will leverage Ethernet VPN (EVNP) and the BGP routing protocol to provide an interoperable control-plane switching solution for Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels. Additionally, it\u2019ll offer tooling and automation features that allow for single operational models spanning more than 100 platforms.\n\u201cCumulus and Minipack will power the next generation of data center architecture,\u201d said Cumulus Networks cofounder and CTO JR Rivers. \u201cThe modular design of Minipack brings a more open approach to hardware, [complementing] what Cumulus has been doing on the open networking side for years with over 100 different cost-effective hardware options. We\u2019ve always believed that hardware is an important part of the open ecosystem, and through our close work with the teams at Facebook, Edgecore, and Broadcom, the availability of Minipack with Cumulus Linux is a market-leveler \u2014 bringing a new level of control over cost and operations that was previously only accessible to the largest network operators.\u201d\nFacebook is donating Minipack to the Open Compute Project, an organization that shares data center product designs among companies such as IBM, Intel, Nokia, Google, Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Lenovo, and Alibaba Group. The idea, Schmidtke said, is to provide the industry with a standardized solution toward the goal of mitigating errors and helping operators manage switches more effectively.\n\u201cOpenness and collaboration help organizations scale faster, and by building our data centers with fully open and disaggregated hardware and software,\u201d he said. \u201c[And] we continue to drive innovation and give these designs to the community for others to use.\u201d\nThe Minipack is available from Cumulus Networks and from authorized channel partners. The first PIM options are the PIM-16Q with 16x100G QSFP28 ports and the PIM-4DD with 4x400G QSFP-DD ports.\nFacebook isn\u2019t the only tech giant that contributed datacenter infrastructure to the Open Compute Project today. Microsoft open-sourced Project Zipline, a compression algorithm fine-tuned for large cloud data sets, and Verilog, the project\u2019s low-level backend code.\n}}
{{Federal government employees should be free to work with iPads from coffee shops and to use social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate with Canadians, says Treasury Board President Tony Clement.\nIn an interview with iPolitics, Clement said he also wants to launch a pilot project to use social media to consult Canadians on proposed governmental decisions and to engage the public more in dialogue.\nClement, a prolific tweeter who has been known to announce changes to government positions via Twitter, said the Treasury Board will soon unveil social media guidelines for public servants.\nClement\u2019s comments came after he testified before the Senate Official Languages Committee Thursday, discussing bilingualism in the public service and the government\u2019s respect of official languages on the internet and in social media.\nClement told senators that social media is not only \u201ccritical and integral\u201d to how public servants do their jobs but also to its ability to recruit talented young people.\n\u201cIt would be quite bizarre if we\u2019re trying to hire the best and the brightest young people with great vitality coming into the public service and they\u2019re used to having tethered tablets and instant social media feedback and they can do half of their work at the coffee shop without any difficulty and then suddenly they are transformed into a public servant and none of that is available. That would be a bizarre situation.\n\u201cI think we all agree that we want to make it easy and exciting for people to join the public service, that they can use these kinds of tools in order to succeed and to do their jobs.\u201d\nClement said social media presents new opportunities for the government to communicate with Canadians.\n\u201cTo use social media, to speak directly to people, to our constituents, to citizens, to communicate rapidly and directly with our employees and the Canadian public is a challenge, but it is big occasion to promote the conversation between citizens and the Canadian government. It is very important for the future.\u201d\nHowever, Clement said social media is so new and changing so quickly that the government does not yet have rules on how it should be used.\n\u201cMy department is developing guidelines on the use of social media as a means of communication between government and Canadians and also within the public service. The guidelines will also cover social media as a means of service delivery to the public and as a working tool amongst employees.\u201d\nClement said a key part of those guidelines will cover how to ensure social media use respects the government\u2019s requirements on language of work and communications with the public.\nSome departments are already doing that, he pointed out.\n\u201cI was doing a Parks Canada event in my riding and I was impressed that Parks Canada was tweeting as I was doing the park opening in both official languages. \u2026I thought that was an excellent signal for their audience that they were prepared to do that.\u201d\nCorinne Charette, the government\u2019s chief information officer, said 66 federal government institutions now have bilingual twitter accounts and official government communications are presented in both official languages.\nIt\u2019s also popular with government employees, she said.\n\u201cSocial media is an exciting development. It is widely requested by public servants and particularly younger public servants as the minister has indicated. I really don\u2019t see why it would be a barrier. In fact, I think it is an enabler.\u201d\nClement told senators he is also pushing ahead with his open data initiative, to get more raw data out of institutions like Statistics Canada and make it public.\n\u201cThe more data we can get out there, the more applications can be thought of by brilliant people, entrepreneurs.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Clement told the committee that the Treasury Board will be reviewing the upcoming census data to decide where government services should continue to be available in both English and French.\n\u201cThis exercise, which takes place every 10 years consists of a review of the linguistic obligations of federal offices in light of the most recent national census.\u201d\nThe review of the government\u2019s official language service regulations will take place between January 2013 and Fall 2015.\n[email protected]\n}}

{{Facebook\u2019s stock fell 11 percent in after hours trading this afternoon, reaching a new low of $24, after the social network reported earnings for the first time as a public company.\nFacebook barely exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations with $1.18 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.12 for the second quarter. The company reported a net loss of $157 million, attributed to its share-based compensation plan. At the time of this post, Facebook\u2019s stock was down 10 percent at $24.15.\nThe dip isn\u2019t too shocking for Facebook\u2019s stock, given how tumultuous it\u2019s been so far.

{{After studying more than 200 billion Facebook ads, it has been discovered that the ads are more effective on iOS than on Android. The study conducted by Nanigans shows that Facebook ads on iOS are 1,790% more profitable than on Android-powered devices.\nNanigans is one of Facebook\u2019s largest ad buyers specifically focusing on retail advertising. According to the company (via VentureBeat), iOS-based ads have shown a surprisingly high click through rate:\n\u201cRetailers are realizing significantly greater return from audiences on iOS than audiences on Android,\u201d the report says. \u201cFor the first three quarters of 2013, RPC [revenue per click] on iOS averaged 6.1 times higher than Android and ROI [return on investment] on iOS averaged 17.9 times higher than Android.\u201d \u201cAudiences cost more on iPhone, and the reason is that it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Slagen said. \u201cTypically, we\u2019re not looking to acquire one-time customers, we\u2019re looking to invest over time \u2026 so we pay more up front for better long-term results.\u201d\nThe graph above shows retailers\u2019 return on investment for Facebook mobile advertising.

{{Facebook has been trying really, really hard to convince its users that the social network cares about our privacy and is becoming a more (buzzword alert) \"transparent\" platform.\nThis makes the recent revelation that Facebook secretly deleted Mark Zuckerberg's messages in Messenger without notifying the recipients uncomfortable, to say the very least.\nOn Friday, TechCrunch revealed that Facebook has been scrubbing private messages Zuckerberg sent before 2014 from the platform. People who'd communicated with Zuckerberg over Messenger found that their messages suddenly looked like entirely one-sided conversations \u2014 with no trace of Zuckerberg's correspondence left in their inboxes. Facebook never notified them it was doing this.\nNormally, Facebook users can delete their messages \u2014 but that only appears on one's own side of the chat. Currently, users have no way of deleting sent messages from the recipients' inbox.\nNot so for Zuck. Facebook told TechCrunch that it had deleted the messages as a corporate security measure after the Sony hack revealed just how damaging seemingly innocuous messages can look when revealed to the public. Of course, that's not exactly a good explanation for why users weren't notified of this corporate practice. And then there's the fact that once your average, non-CEO Facebook user sends a message on Messenger, it can exist forever in another's inbox.\nIn a rare move, Facebook has apologized for their stealthy deleting ways. And to bridge the discrepancy between the executives' and users' experiences, a Facebook spokesperson told Mashable that it will be rolling out an \"unsend\" feature for Messaging in the coming months. Currently, \"secret mode\" in messenger (which is the name for their end-to-end encryption option) lets users set a timer for messages to disappear. But the report of the executive scrubbing seems to have accelerated the roll-out of this feature to regular Messenger, too.\n\u201cWe have discussed this feature several times. And people using our secret message feature in the encrypted version of Messenger have the ability to set a timer \u2014 and have their messages automatically deleted. We will now be making a broader delete message feature available. This may take some time. And until this feature is ready, we will no longer be deleting any executives' messages. We should have done this sooner \u2014 and we're sorry that we did not,\" Facebook wrote in a statement to Mashable.\nThat change is coming ... eventually. But if you want the same level of security as Mark Zuckeberg right now, you may have to look beyond non-secret mode Messenger. Here are some of the best services for creating self-destructing messages.\n1) Snapchat\nIt's only fair to give the first spot to the Ghosties themselves. Disappearing messages are Snapchat's bread and butter. In chat, messages disappear after all parties have read them.\nHowever, messages in Snapchat are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the platform and law enforcement may have access to your messages. And though Snapchat says it doesn't keep users' snaps on its servers, there is a fair amount of skepticism about that claim.\n2) Signal\nThis is one of the preferred and highly vaunted end-to-end encrypted apps used by journalists and sources. It ensures that law enforcement and the messaging company can't read your communications. It also has the option to enable disappearing messages. Tap the name of a contact and turn on the \"Disappearing Messages\" option in their info. Messages will disappear after they have been seen.\n3) Telegram\nThis is a messaging app in which security measures like end-to-end encryption and disappearing messages are an option (though not a default). There are two ways to disappear your messages on Telegram. First, you can use the \"secret chat\" feature, which only hosts messages (until they automatically disappear) on the mobile devices on which they're sent and received. And, similar to Signal, in regular chats \u2014 which sync across devices on Telegram \u2014 you have the option of turning on self-destructing messages, too.\n4) Confide\nSelf-destruct is the default on Confide, a messaging app predicated on ephemeral messaging. It is end-to-end encrypted and messages automatically self-destruct once they've been read.\nBut what makes this app really standout is its \"ScreenShield\" technology: Confide prevents users from taking screenshots, an increasing source of leaks on messaging services like Slack. If you attempt to take a screenshot of messages in the seconds before they disappear on Confide, all that shows up in your photos is a blank white screen. Pretty nifty.\n5) WhatsApp\nFacebook does own WhatsApp, but this popular messaging service enables what Facebook Messenger doesn't. Messages won't automatically disappear in WhatsApp, but users have the ability to delete any text, photo, or video message after it's been sent. All that remains is a bubble that says \"this message has been deleted.\"\nIt's not quite gone without a trace. But it's still disappeared from both the sender's and the recipient's chat log.\nUPDATE April 6, 2018 2:30 p.m. E.S.T.: This story was updated to include a statement from Facebook and information about their \"secret\" messaging feature.\n}}
{{For almost a decade, most of us using Facebook have trusted it with our personal data. We shared pictures, locations of fun places we visited, friends --old and new -- with whom we connected, 'liked' activities, and much more.\nAnd we did this not knowing our personal information was being used in ways beyond anyone's comprehension. As we watch the Facebook story unfold, we may wonder whether this crisis could have been avoided had personal data privacy and governance been better handled. Such initiatives could be complex and expensive for any company, but is it fair to say there are no shortcuts to this approach? How prepared is any company that relies on personal data?\nThat said, Facebook has opened up considerably in the last few weeks by giving new controls to its users. Let's acknowledge it's not easy for complex organizations like Facebook to implement these changes. Facebook has even created a new page explaining how GDPR impacts their business, advertising, consent management, and more. Despite Facebook giving data privacy controls to its users, it remains to be seen whether the company is GDPR-compliant. We will find out only after May 25. Regardless, the question is, could this have been avoided? And if so, how? The answer is not an easy one. For a start, Facebook must now move personal data pertaining to 1.5 billion+ users who aren't EU citizens out of the data governance and processing framework of Facebook Ireland into that of Facebook USA. Google, on the other hand, has been able to maneuver the regulation fairly well, avoiding an equivalent PR crisis. The firm has been preparing for this and has been able to make the requested corrections. That is not to say that Google is GDPR-compliant either -- at least they haven't stated so explicitly.\nIt is important to understand a few questions here: Why is Facebook going through this PR crisis? What is the cost of implementing an organization-wide solution, best practices, and a strong adherence to regulations like GDPR in such data-centric companies? What does the process of instituting data governance practices in an organization like Facebook entail? It will also be interesting to see how the other hundreds of smaller ISVs deal with this when the May 25 deadline hits this year. I won't respond to all these questions, but will lay the groundwork for what other companies can do to avoid these pitfalls.\nAs organizations grow over time, they tend to implement data governance, storage, and processing capabilities based on the perceived value of the data. For example, IT admins tend to set up separate data stores for product development teams, quality assurance, business units, sales, support, and finance as they evolve, either on-premises or in one or more public clouds. Seldom do they focus on critical concepts such as data portability, data mapping, and knowing where all the data is stored. This is further magnified by the fact that most companies in the business of data have not only structured data but semi-structured and unstructured data as well. With all the text, photos, and videos uploaded by its almost two billion users, Facebook has more unstructured data than structured. This problem touches people, processes, and technology. For decades, IT teams have built data warehouses to dump all their data in. Over time, this becomes expensive and is unmanageable when even subsets of that data need to be retrieved for specific purposes.\nAlso, it is a misconception that US companies are immune to GDPR. From startups to larger Facebook-like enterprises, no (personal) data-centric company restricts their products and offerings to US- or country-specific audiences. They sell their product to whoever will buy it. Any company with 250 or more employees should view GDPR as an opportunity learn what personal data it handles and/or processes, assess their data governance practices, and make speedy improvements to reach 100 percent compliance. Yet, it seems most companies are not prepared for this reality.\nBeing GDPR-compliant for any organization means having their ducks in a row for each of the following:\n\u2022 Having a map view of the data, including all the way from the source systems, to ensure lineage and proper auditing\n\u2022 Being able to read data from any of the siloed clouds, edge device, or on-premises hardware\n\u2022 Being able to write into or remove data located in any of these silos\n\u2022 Ensuring secure data transfers\n\u2022 Enforcing granular policy controls for personal data\nWith GDPR regulation coming into effect in less than a month, companies are forced to look at 'accelerator' solutions, in other words, a GDPR-ready data lake.\nIf Facebook had their ducks in a row for each of the above with a GDPR-ready data lake type of solution, had their users explicitly opted-in for all its services, and had users known exactly how advertisers and developers used data collected from Facebook, it can be argued that the company could have avoided the PR crisis.\nWith GDPR coming into effect on May 25, 2018, CxOs, data protection officers, and enterprise architects should start thinking about the most efficient approach to instituting data privacy, security, and governance practices across the enterprise. For companies that handle personal data pertaining to EU citizens, implementing a GDPR-ready data lake is probably the best investment to confidently avoid the type of backlash Facebook is facing today.\nRonak Chokshi is product marketing and solutions strategy lead for MapR Technologies.

{{Share\nFacebook has finally addressed the Peter Thiel controversy that was threatening to once again drag it in to a media quagmire.\nThe platform\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, tackled the issue head-on when it was raised at Re/code\u2019s annual Code Conference on Wednesday. Despite the recent revelation that Thiel covertly financed wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s successful lawsuit against news outlet Gawker Media, Sandberg insisted that the Silicon Valley investor would remain a Facebook board member.\n\u201cPeter did what he did on his own, not as a Facebook board member. We didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d claimed Sandberg. \u201cWe have very independent board members with very independent thoughts that they share publicly.\u201d\nShe went on to add: \u201cThose strong people make really good board members because they have strong views, and they\u2019re not afraid to think differently than other people, which has served Facebook well.\u201d\nThe calls for Thiel\u2019s dismissal have mainly come from media organizations, which are accusing the billionaire entrepreneur of using his wealth to effectively silence the press. In the lawsuit\u2019s aftermath, and following Thiel\u2019s defense of his actions, questions began to arise regarding Facebook\u2019s stance on the matter. Fresh off the back of a similar free-speech debacle regarding its trending topics feed, Facebook\u2019s silence reflected its apprehension over an issue that had some members of the press riled up.\nSandberg spoke of Facebook\u2019s existing relationship with the media when quizzed as to how the company would respond if Thiel was methodically suppressing publishers. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to answer all of these hypotheticals, but what really matters, is Gawker is getting distribution from us as is the New York Times, as is Fox News, as is Re/code,\u201d she stated.\nShe also made reference to the comparisons that were being made to the way Facebook treated board member Marc Andreessen over his disparaging comments about India. Sandberg claimed that unlike Andreessen \u2014 who was publicly called out over his statements by CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 Thiel acted alone, and \u201cnot as a Facebook board member.\u201d\nAsked about her own future, and the rumors surrounding an alleged offer for the role of CEO at Disney, Sandberg stated that she wasn\u2019t going anywhere: \u201cI don\u2019t want another job. I love Facebook.\u201d\n}}
{{Last month two Flagler County Sheriff\u2019s deputies showed up at Tony Lagano\u2019s door to talk about a Facebook video he\u2019d posted, in which he\u2019d burned a court document and said the words \u201cschool shooting\u201d in passing, though clearly not as a threat. The deputies spoke with him, he explained that what he was saying had nothing to do with shootings\u2013he was upset that a judge had not allowed his daughter to testify in a domestic relations proceeding\u2013and the deputies left.\nOn April 28, however, Lagano, 35, a resident of 50 Fernwood Lane, was arrested, charged with violating an injunction, and booked at the Flagler County jail on $20,000 bond, an unusually high amount for a first-degree felony. Lagano has been at the jail since, apparently unable to bond out.\nLagano has been involved in a protracted child custody case with his ex-wife. On April 12, he was served with an injunction for protection that stipulated he was to stay away from his ex-wife and have no contact with her either by phone or text, or through any other electronic means. The injunction applies to his ex-wife as well. Lagano ignored it. He all but intentionally violated the injunction to go to jail.\n\u201cI know you thought you were going to get rid of me,\u201d he texted his ex-wife after midnight on April 28. \u201cBut it just so happens that I love my daughter and I\u2019m going to go to jail for it. So report me go ahead do it, I want you to. I\u2019m not scared of a couple of days in jail bitch. Lolz. Xxx.\u201d Five hours later he texted again, asking \u201chow is our daughter?\u201d The provocative approach mirrors other postings on Lagano\u2019s Facebook page on various issues.\nLagano did not deny sending the texts when deputies showed up at his door, but claimed that his ex-wife \u201cviolates the contact order all the time,\u201d according to his arrest report. Nevertheless he was fully aware that the injunction applied to him. He was arrested and booked at the jail\u2013for the fifth time since 2009. But this is the highest bond he\u2019s faced.\n}}
{{Berlin\u2019s district court ruled this week that Facebook\u2019s Friend Finder feature was invading people\u2019s privacy \u2014 and that the site should not let people use it without explicitly telling them that that the tool can suck in the details from their entire email address book, including names and physical addresses.\nThe court also found that Facebook was wrong to claim rights over photos and other content uploaded by its users, and that it has to get a user\u2019s consent before sticking their profile picture into Facebook ads.\nDespite reports suggesting that the problem had been fixed, however, that may not actually be the case.\nConsumer rights group VZBV, which launched the complaint, said it was happy with the ruling \u2014 which it hailed as a \u201cmilestone\u201d in a statement (auf Deutsch) \u2014 a spokesman told me that that there are still significant issues with the way Friend Finder works.\n\u201cWhile the Facebook application in the meantime has been modified slightly, in our opinion it is still insufficient,\u201d VZBV told me.\n\u201cUsers are still not adequately informed that their entire address book will be imported to Facebook. For example, Facebook sometimes imports the entire address book \u2014 including names, addresses and maybe telephone numbers \u2014 not only the email addresses.\u201d\nVZBV also pointed out that Friend Finder sometimes imports email addresses from the mail client\u2019s outbox or sent mail folder, as well as from the address book.\n\u201cThe consumer does not know these things. Therefore the consumer cannot assess its consent to import his address book,\u201d the group said.\nThe group also said it was looking forward to the new EU-wide data privacy rules that the European Commission is proposing \u2014 these reforms include the so-called \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019, which means social networks and other \u2018data controllers\u2019 have to delete personal information about a user when that person asks them to.\nFacebook itself hasn\u2019t publicly announced its next move, saying only that it will \u201ctake a close look into the details of [the] court decision as soon as they are available and then decide on the next steps.\u201d\nFacebook does get a pretty tough time of it in Germany. The country\u2019s history \u2013 think the Nazis and the Stasi \u2013 is a major factor that makes people there more aware of privacy issues than most. Germany was, in fact, the first country to introduce data protection laws, and it bases its laws on very strict interpretations of wider European Union rules.\nGerman officials have previously taken Facebook to task over its facial tagging systems, \u2018Like\u2019 buttons and Facebook Pages. And the Berlin case follows on from Facebook\u2019s 2010 encounter with the Hamburg data protection officials. That time round, the case was dropped after Facebook agreed to let non-members opt out of receiving invitations, and promised to make it more apparent to users when it was sending out emails to their non-member friends.\nNot satisfied, the VZBV took Facebook to court in Berlin, complaining that Friend Finder breaches German (and European) data protection laws. The court agreed.\nBut Facebook isn\u2019t the only U.S. company to hit such problems \u2014 Google has given up on updating its Street View imagery for Germany, following widespread protests from the public and officials.\n}}
{{Apart from their more active assaults against the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department has also been waging a propaganda war. They have forwarded false statements, ostensibly from the self-proclaimed \u201cwater protectors,\u201d to mainstream media news outlets that have yet to provide on the ground coverage of the protests in North Dakota, and who generally therefore trust the sheriff\u2019s department.\nMany of the claims coming from the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department have been debunked by eyewitnesses, but media outlets who have refused to send reporters to see for themselves, such as CNN, parrot the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s statements, assuming that a report from police is invariably the same as the truth.\nThe Facebook page of the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department was removed on November 25. On Thanksgiving, they posted a photo in honor of the various law enforcement officers who have come from all over the country to help put down the protests. The Sheriff\u2019s Department also solicited donations, fitting, perhaps, considering hat they have depleted millions of dollars in funds in their efforts to suppress and attack the unarmed Dakota Access Pipeline water protectors. The Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not respond for comment as to why their Facebook page was removed and has yet to be restored.\nThe Morton County Sheriff's Department had the nerve to post a Thanksgiving message while it brutalizes & represses #NoDAPL water protectors pic.twitter.com/UzG7ZYb5db \u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) November 25, 2016\nReporters who travel to the site have not had an easy time of it. Democracy Now journalist Amy Goodman was arrested after reporting that private security guards hired by the pipeline were using dogs to attack some of the water protectors. The frivolous charges against Goodman were dropped, and the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department revealed the guards were not even properly licensed to work in North Dakota.\nIn October, the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department issued a press release claiming water protectors attacked three journalists. The sheriff\u2019s office failed to name what outlet they were reportedly from, and no journalists ever reported being attacked.\nIn addition to Goodman, several other journalists reporting from Standing Rock have been shot with rubber bullets and even arrested.\nOn November 20, the Morton County Sheriff Department issued a press release claiming water protectors were using IEDs (improvised explosive devices). On the ground media reports refute these claims, including video evidence showing the violence was one-sided toward the water protectors. The department claimed to obtain glass jars \u201cconsistent with the design of Molotov Cocktails\u201d but have not produced any evidence proving their claims. No police injuries have been reported. While there has been many video and photographic accounts of the violence from police toward the water protectors, no corresponding evidence has been released which corroborates any of the claims from the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department that violence was being used by those protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nWater cannons were used against the water protectors in subfreezing temperatures, resulting in 300 injuries, according to the Standing Rock Medic Council. One of the more severe injuries was caused by a concussion grenade thrown at 21-year-old Williams College graduate Sophia Wilansky. The Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department claimed the injury was self-inflicted by the protestors. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, a Bronx based attorney, released a statement on November 22 in regards to the incident.\n\u201cAt around 4:30 a.m. after the police hit the bridge with water cannons and rubber bullets and pepper spray, they lobbed a number of concussion grenades which are not supposed to be thrown at people directly, at protesters, or protectors, as they want to be called. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm, taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident\u2014it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her.\u201d\nA GoFundMe created on behalf of Wilansky to cover the medical expenses from the numerous surgeries she is facing to have a chance at saving her arm has reached nearly half a million dollars in donations.\nThe Young Turks reporter Jordan Chariton interviewed an eyewitness who was with Sophia Wilansky when she was injured who reaffirmed Wilansky\u2019s injuries were inflicted by the police.\nDisinformation campaigns in regards to the Dakota Access Pipeline have been propagated by the oil companies behind the pipeline as well. This includes a Standing Rock \u201cfact-checker\u201d website and public relation efforts conducted by the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now. The latter has published Op-Eds in The Hill and the Washington Examiner, one of which claims, with no evidence, that the Standing Rock Sioux are protesting the pipeline just to get \u201ceasy money.\u201d This is the same tribe who has refused to accept over $1 billion from the United States government for land that was stolen from them in the Black Hills because it was never for sale in the first place.\nThe ongoing efforts to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock will go down in history as one of the most significant civil rights issues of our time. Hopefully the lessons learned from past civil rights battles will be addressed toward this issue before President Obama finds his legacy on the wrong side of history as the leader who could have done something but chose to do nothing.\n}}
{{Last week during an interview , Facebook\u2019s VP of marketing solutions, Carolyn Everson, explained to a reporter, \u201cWe care deeply, as deep as a company can care about privacy. It\u2019s the foundation of our company, and we want people to know that we care.\u201d A few days later the company copped to a bug that gave app developers access to private user photos, which raised quite a few eyebrows. Late last night, the New York Times dropped a bombshell of a story describing just how false Everson\u2019s statement is.\nThis article details the partnerships Facebook has had with some of the largest tech companies in the world, and the reams of user data it provided to them. Here\u2019s a taste of what Facebook gave up to these other businesses:\nFacebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.\nThose are just a few examples; the Times says more than 150 companies had similar partnerships with Facebook, including Huawei and the Royal Bank of Canada.\nThere are many threads to this story that need to be teased out. For one, these deals certainly sound like they should be illegal, given Facebook never asked for specific user consent to send over their personal data to these other companies. Facebook, however, claims that it didn\u2019t need to since it considered these companies \u201cservice providers,\u201d which were acting in the interests of the social network. This seems like an exceptionally broad rationale, given the companies Facebook worked with spanned industries and expertise. BlackBerry, Yahoo, and Russian internet company Yandex all were reportedly given some access as part of these partnerships; they certainly would not all be acting in the same interests as Facebook when given user data.\nAnother lingering question is how Facebook was able to keep tabs on these partnerships and what they did with the data. Facebook told the Times that it found \u201cno evidence of abuse by its partners,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear how the company would even know. It seems it rarely audited these other companies. (One interesting side note is that Facebook has performed one past audit of a company that used its data: the Boston-based analytics firm Crimson Hexagon. And after a review Facebook reinstated the company\u2019s access.)\nThis latest revelation, along with all the details we\u2019ve learned since the Cambridge Analytica debacle, illustrate the only three things Facebook really cares about: user data, growth, and how the two together further the company\u2019s ambitions. These partnerships were ways that Facebook stayed relevant, by interlacing its services within other businesses. The price, of course, was user data. Writes the Times:\nFacebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.\nThis is the heart of Facebook\u2019s sleight of hand. For years, it has firmly stated that it never sold user data. The company frequently and forcefully gave statements like Everson\u2019s, insisting that Facebook treats its user privacy with the utmost care. But the truth is that though it didn\u2019t sell the terabytes of information, it still used it as a bargaining chip for its domination. Facebook\u2019s strategy was to work with other organizations as a way to increase its dominance, and its currency was access to our data without so much as telling us.\n}}
{{British lawmakers accused Facebook of \"intentionally and knowingly\" violating data privacy laws in a report published Sunday about social media disinformation.\nThe UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee reviewed a trove of internal Facebook emails which they allege prove the social media giant violated data privacy and competition laws.\nThe documents were obtained from a small app company called Six4Three that is behind a lawsuit in California against the company.\n\"The evidence that we obtained from the Six4Three court documents indicates that Facebook was willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers, to charge high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of that data, and to starve some developers-such as Six4Three-of that data, thereby causing them to lose their business,\" the committee said in the report. \"It seems clear that Facebook was, at the very least, in violation of its Federal Trade Commission settlement.\"\nA spokesperson for Facebook told The Hill the company denies breaching data privacy or protection laws.\n\"We share the Committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence,\" Karim Palant, U.K. public policy manager at Facebook, said in a statement.\n\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"\nThe company has previously told The Hill that documents obtained from the Six4Three are inaccurate.\n\"As we've said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\nSix4Three, a controversial company that developed an app allowing users to find bikini pictures posted by their friends, sued Facebook in 2015 after the social network restricted access to the user data.\n-Updated at 2:09 p.m.\n}}
{{Does that headline excite you? Well, according to a recent study, there are a lot of you that would happily hand over the responsibility of keeping your money safe to either Google, Facebook or Amazon. But weirdly, not Apple?\nAccording to a poll carried out by Fujitsu \u2013 who themselves have a finance division \u2013 20 percent of respondents said they would use Facebook, Google or Amazon to buy banking or insurance services if available.\nThe reason behind the response, according to TechRadar, is that they expect big banks to keep rolling out technology innovations at the same pace that tech companies do.\nFailing to do so, would mean 37 percent would leave their banking or insurance provider. But how likely is it that one of these big tech companies will move into big finance? Well, Google has been flirting with the idea through a series of small, but significant financial services.\nA bank of Google?\nThere\u2019s Android Pay \u2013 which is essentially an interface between your existing credit and debit cards, your phone and NFC card readers in stores \u2013 Google Wallet, which is an older, clunkier version that Pay was supposed to replace. There\u2019s a great piece on the difference between the two over on Android Central.\nThen there\u2019s other things like a mortgage calculator available through search. You can also send money through Google, too. Facebook does the same.\nAmazon has taken a step further than both by offering loans to thousands of invited sellers in its market place. So we can assume these companies have an appetite for finance.\nBut there are several glaring reasons why we won\u2019t ever have to write the headline, \u201cGoogle opens its first banking branch\u201d on TNW anytime soon.\nThe first and most obvious one is regulations. They are so long and convoluted that in Britain, arguably the world\u2019s financial and currency hub, before 2010 there had not been a single banking license granted in more than 100 years.\nAdmittedly, things have picked up a bit \u2013 but it still took a small private bank more than four years to get its license last year. That\u2019s just for Britain.\nIn America, to operate as a bank you can\u2019t negotiate with just the government. You have to go from state-to-state applying for a charter to do business. You can find out more about how arduous that is over here.\nNow imagine doing that from country to country. This is a slow, cumbersome business. Not very Google, Amazon or Facebook.\nThe boring business of banking\nThe second major reason is pissing off giant financial institutions by launching a direct competitor is a very silly idea.\nA quick and decisive response to a Google or Facebook bank would be to remove support. So if Barclays didn\u2019t like the cut of Facebook\u2019s jib, it could easily tell its 48 million global customers that it no longer is going to let them send money through the social network.\nCredit: Facebook\nThat\u2019s a pretty big hole to fill for any company, even Facebook.\nAlternatively, the financial industry can lean on the US Chamber of Commerce, who spend more than a billion dollars lobbying the US government on things it doesn\u2019t agree with, like climate change, and letting banks who did bad business during the credit crunch fail.\nAs a comparison, the tech industry spends 100 times less.\nThe third and most interesting reason for Google et al to not open a bank is that there are so many other ways of capturing financial data without having to build a bank.\nOne such company is Curve. It allows users to combine all their existing cards from different banks into one card that is accepted everywhere. It then presents all of that data on your phone, in real time.\nMondo, another British start-up has created a card that you can use like the one a bank would issue but without the hassle.\nThe problems with everyday banking for consumers, in my view, is down to basic things: convenience, customer service and a vested interest in you not maxing out your credit cards or being fined for going into your overdraft. So, in tech terms, its UX and customer service.\nAmazon for one prides itself on those two things, and could easily roll out a service that is, quick, easy to use and offers more one-on-one guidance to better money management.\nIn March 2015 the Economist Intelligence Unit, when conducting a survey of the retail banking sector, found 25 percent of respondents felt technology could most effectively help banks know their customers better, and knowing people is Google\u2019s business already.\nThe banking industry hasn\u2019t really grabbed onto how much detail a bank statement reveals when it comes to what stage of life a person is at, their hopes, dreams, anxieties and fears.\nGoogle knows that already through what you tap into its search engine. Facebook knows what ethnicity you are purely by what you like. Amazon knows what you want before you\u2019ll buy it.\nGoogle wants payments as it gets the data of the purchase, as does Facebook. Amazon wants it to help push things to you at a later date that you\u2019re more likely to buy. But primarily, it\u2019s about the data and not the amount of transaction.\nBanks were built to handle dollars and cents, not bits and clicks.\nThe University of Cambridge Judge Business School noted the ongoing growth of non-cash payments, despite the financial crisis, and the development of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology used by Google and others.\nThat means cash reserves and assets will become (marginally) less important than the digital movement (and the context of that movement) of money online.\nThese big tech companies are in prime position to offer smaller, more constrained financial services without ever becoming what we\u2019d traditionally think of as a bank.\nEven the banks think so.\n\u201cIt is more likely, like you see with Amazon, about being able to offer instalment credit, because you can make a 20-30 per cent return on that with the data you have, without necessarily having to open a branch,\u201d Peter Simon, head of information at Barclays told Computer Business Review.\nSo while a fifth of you might want a bank of Amazon, in reality, what is more likely to happen is that Amazon will build a bank around you and your purchases, leaving your high street bank to do all the \u2018dumb\u2019 work like payment processing, currency exchanges and the like.\nNow that is a more exciting future.\nWould you bank with Facebook or Google? on TechRadar\nRead next: Apple's hometown is pretty pissed off that the company 'abuses' its dominant position\n}}
{{Eight years later, it seems McNamee has had a spiritual awakening. In those earlier days, had he been badly \"zucked\"? It's plausible, judging by his book, Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\nThese days, McNamee proffers markedly different advice. Engagement, it turns out, is just one of Facebook's bland euphemisms for getting users addicted to its services; its sinister aim is to produce \"behavior modification that makes advertising more valuable.\" The McNamee of the 2019 vintage insists that no self-respecting start-up should get in bed with Facebook. While Twitter and Google also get a beating, McNamee mostly directs his rage at Facebook, the company he knows best, charging it with amplifiying tribalism, allowing \"bad actors\" to \"harm democracy\" and even \"shirking civic responsibility.\"\nAnyone looking for a systematic treatment of Silicon Valley's political and economic power will probably be disappointed. Zucked does dabble in the recent history of Silicon Valley and the country to explain how both have turned libertarian, substituting civic engagement at the heart of a vibrant democracy with user engagement at the heart of Facebook's outsize balance sheet.\nSuch analytical efforts, however, mostly stay on the surface. McNamee is much more convincing on the inner workings of Silicon Valley, pointing, for example, to the disproportionate role of the \"PayPal Mafia\" \u2014 including Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman and many others \u2014 in shaping the culture of start-ups that, like Facebook, blossomed in the 2000s.\nZucked arrives at a time when anti-Facebook sentiment, fueled in part by the never-ending controversy over the 2016 presidential election and its sprawling data scandals, is still riding high. The \"techlash\" (once of interest only to the nerd contingents of Washington and Brussels) has now engulfed many other parts of the world, with Sri Lanka even briefly banning Facebook for inciting mob violence.\nThe good old days when we worried about civic apathy and bowling alone are long gone; today, we hardly know how to stop the hyperactive, unruly parts of \"civil society\" from Facebooking together. From misinformation to psychological dependencies, from cyberbullying to ethnic cleansing, the occasional byproducts of connecting humanity by means of advertising can no longer be dismissed. The global village seemed like a most venerable destination \u2014 until we glanced at the cost of the trip.\nMcNamee played a minor role in Facebook's early years; in addition to occasionally mentoring Zuckerberg, he helped hire the social network's second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg. McNamee has spent the past three years ringing alarms on the company. Zucked is a culmination of these efforts. His advocacy has involved not only a stream of op-eds, essays and frequent media appearances, but also coaching Congress on grilling secretive tech executives about the data skeletons in their server closets.\n}}

{{(CNN) -- A young woman who broadcast the beating and racial taunting of a man on Facebook Live has been arrested with three others in connection with the gruesome attack, Chicago police said Wednesday.\nThe disturbing 30-minute video shows a man tied up and his mouth covered, cowering in the corner of a room. His attackers laugh and shout \"f*ck Donald Trump\" and \"f*ck white people\" as they kick and punch him.\nThe video shows someone cutting into his scalp with a knife, leaving a visibly bald patch.\nPolice said the victim is an 18-year-old with special needs. Officers found the disoriented young man wandering a Chicago street \"in crisis\" Tuesday afternoon.\nHe was so traumatized that it took most of the night for him to calm down so he was able to talk to police, Capt. Steven Sesso said.\nThe suspects, two men and two women, all 18, are in custody awaiting formal charges, which are expected to be filed Thursday.\nHate crime charges under consideration\nThe victim knew at least one of his accused attackers from school, Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said. Though he may have voluntarily gotten into a van with the group, police are considering kidnapping charges.\nBecause the victim is white and the people in the video are black, police also are investigating whether hate crime charges are appropriate, Duffin said.\n\"Although they are adults, they're 18. Kids make stupid decisions -- I shouldn't call them kids; they're legally adults, but they're young adults, and they make stupid decisions,\" Duffin said.\n\"That certainly will be part of whether or not ... we seek a hate crime, to determine whether or not this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.\"\nIt's possible the racially charged statements were little more than people \"ranting about something they think might make a headline,\" Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.\nHe said he did not believe the attack was politically motivated.\n\"It's sickening,\" he said. \"It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that.\"\nChicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi emphasized Thursday that the investigation has so far not revealed a racial or political motive.\nThe incident comes as Chicago draws intense scrutiny for a grim milestone: 762 homicides in 2016. Johnson commended the patrol officers for attending to the victim in distress and following the case through. \"You hear the narrative that police are backing down and not doing their jobs; this is a perfect example of them doing their jobs,\" he said.\nVideo pulled from Facebook\nFacebook confirmed that it pulled the original video from the suspect's Facebook profile.\n\"We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.\"\nAccording to its community standards, the company removes content, disables accounts and works with law enforcement in cases of a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\nFacebook users also can report offensive material to staff dedicated to responding to such reports. If a live stream starts blowing up, staffers monitor it for possible violations and interrupt it if need be.\nThe timeline\nThe victim's parents reported him missing Monday, telling police they had not heard from their son since dropping him off Saturday at a McDonald's in the Chicago suburb of Streamwood.\nPolice in Streamwood said that after the man was reported missing, his parents began getting text messages from someone \"claiming to be holding him captive.\"\nOfficers investigating the texts \"discovered a Facebook video depicting (the man) being verbally and physically abused.\" It's unclear what alerted the police to check Facebook.\nSoon after they discovered the video, Streamwood investigators said they were contacted by Chicago police, saying they had found the missing man.\nOn Tuesday Chicago officers responded to a battery call at a residence in the area where the victim had been found. There were signs of a struggle and property damage, police said. Police have not identified the person who made the call.\nAfter viewing the Facebook video, they determined the victim was the man found on the street -- and the people arrested were involved, police said.\nPolice said the victim might have been with the suspects for at least 24 hours.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

{{\u201cWhen my kids were born, my dad bought them Disney shares, and we framed them and hung them up on the wall. They\u2019re excited to know that they are a part of Disney.\u201d\nMike Jones, MySpace\u2019s onetime CEO, told VentureBeat that story a few months ago when we asked him if he planned to buy Facebook stock.\n\u201cPeople will just want to own the stock,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will log into E-Trade and buy Facebook stock because they love it and use it everyday.\u201d\nBuying a nominal number of Facebook shares as a novelty or to \u201cbe part of\u201d the company\u2019s history might be the latest social media trend. The company is going public at the end of next week, and the web is buzzing with opinions and early decisions about the IPO.\nWhile financial heavy-hitters and tech experts are loudly sounding their Facebook-stock-buying plans and giving the proletariat voluminous opinions on how much to buy (and when to sell), normal Facebook users are eyeing the stock in the same way you\u2019d eye a tchotchke in a gift store window at your favorite zoo or theme park. It\u2019s a memento of the day, a reminder of a time and a place when so many memories were made on this one social network.\nWhether or not Facebook stock retains its value into the future \u2014 heck, whether or not Facebook itself still exists in the future \u2014 isn\u2019t of too much concern to these buyers.\nTech PR pro Brian Kramer said the thought of buying a couple of Facebook shares \u201chas actually crossed my mind, just to see what shakes out.\u201d He continued that he\u2019d be making the purchase as a \u201cnovelty for now, but you never know.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know\u201d seems to be something of a theme among these casual traders. Twitter user @uberfuzzy told us he planned to buy a few shares \u201cfirst as a novelty (and to get the financial docs), possibly more later for investment if they don\u2019t MySpace themselves.\u201d\nMost normal Facebook users won\u2019t be buying any shares, but the what-the-heck buyers are almost equal in number to those planning to buy for long-term investment or short-term gains, according to our own limited man-on-the-street polls.\nShares of Facebook stock are likely to enjoy a quick value growth spurt, especially in the first few days and months of trading. Analysts are comparing this IPO to Google\u2019s in 2004. Google\u2019s share price started at $85 and currently sits at around $600, with the company recently announcing a stock split.\nIf Facebook\u2019s stock follows the same trend, these just-for-fun shares could increase their value many times over, potentially ending up worth hundreds of dollars within a few years. One or two shares alone won\u2019t pay anyone\u2019s tuition; still, it\u2019s a fascinating timestamp of the moment when nearly a billion people gathered online at the most important social destination in the world: Facebook.\nFacebook is scheduled to makes its debut on the Nasdaq Friday, May 18, 2012. Shares will start selling in a price range between $28 and $35, but prices are expected to rise dramatically and quickly.\n}}

{{The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a new report yesterday that had some harsh findings for Google and Facebook. The government authority recommended that a new watchdog be formed for the sole purpose of watching over the internet giants.\nThe 374-page document looked into the growth of the digital platforms, and made 11 recommendations. The organization found that the two companies have significant market power in terms of news discovery and digital advertising\u2013and have, up until now, operated in an almost completely unfettered fashion. The report enumerated many concerns about how the companies collect data without consumers realizing.\nOverall, the preliminary findings focused on how the online giants weren\u2019t transparent enough and that regulatory changes needed to be made. It writes that both companies have the \u201cability and incentive\u201d to favor their own business interests, which is troubling given the two\u2019s immense power. With this, the regulator recommended that a series of new rules be set up to keep better watch over their growing power.\nThe ACCC\u2019s press release writes:\nGoogle and Facebook are now the dominant gateways between news media businesses and audiences, and this can reduce the brand value and recognition of media businesses. In addition traditional media businesses and in particular, traditional print media businesses have lost advertising revenue to digital platforms. This has threatened the viability of business models of the print media and their ability to monetise (sic.) journalism.\nOf course, these are just recommendations and nothing has been set in place yet. And both Google and Facebook will likely fight tooth and nail against any big regulatory changes that would hinder their media domination. But as more governments become wise to the growing Google/Facebook consolidation, we\u2019re likely (and hopefully!) going to see more moves like this.\nYou can read the full report here.\n}}

Since the tablet was first launched there have been thousands of accessories for users to choose from, but it wasn\u2019t until the release of the 2nd-geneartion model that these manufactures started to get a little more inventive. The ClamCase was a fine example of this, but there were several issues that stopped it from being perfect. Thankfully there is now the ClamCase Pro for the iPad, which has had a number of improvements.\nBefore we look into those improvements, we thought you might like to know that the ClamCase Pro price is $170 but if you Like the company on Facebook then you\u2019ll get a $20 discount. This isn\u2019t the best deal you could have hoped for, but this Facebook incentive is something that we are starting to see more of lately.\nThe new ClamCase Pro takes all the good features from the original, which was considered a revolution, and improves on them. Firstly you\u2019ll notice from the video that this new ClamCase is thinner, which kind of gives it the look of a thick MacBook Air and because it is thinner it\u2019s also much lighter as well.\nThe keyboard was always a concern with the original model because it had a cramped feel when typing, so as you would assume this issue has been addressed and the keyboard is now more spaced out. Battery life is always going to be a concern so you\u2019ll be happy to know that the ClamCase Pro will now go to sleep automatically when it is not being used and the moment you begin to type will turn back on.\nThe ClamCase pro is certainly a vast improvement over its predecessor, but if you are looking for something to improve the sound of the iPad, then maybe you should consider the Belkin iPad case instead.\n}}

I see a good use for one now,\" Krohn wrote on Facebook, according to an affidavit by a Secret Service agent. The comment was part of a thread about Trump's current stay in Palm Beach and was posted above a photo of Trump that included the text, \"He's not my president / He's an enemy of the state.\"\nThe Secret Service agent wrote that Krohn also posted a picture of a camouflaged man holding a scoped sniper rifle and, above it, wrote, \"The EXPEDITER of Trump! He will never last long.\"\nAnother Facebook user replied to the image, \"WTF does that mean?\"\nKrohn responded, \"Keep yer eyes open!\"\nLaw enforcement, including the Secret Service and Pembroke Pines Police Department, contacted Krohn at his residence. Krohn, according to the Secret Service agent's affidavit, acknowledged that he had been using Facebook earlier in the evening, but became confrontational when asked if he wrote the comments threatening Trump's safety.\nKrohn said that any statements were an expression of his First Amendment rights.\nThe Secret Service agent described that, when further asked about the apparent threats, Krohn became even more confrontational, paced around his yard, and loudly said, \"Well, then arrest me.\"\nKrohn's girlfriend told authorities that she had observed him using Facebook but was unaware of his specific use.

We also take steps to detect and remove data that should not be shared with us,\u201d the company said.\nShares in Facebook took a short-lived hit after the newspaper report was published, but closed up 1.2 percent.\nIn late January Cuomo along with New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation into Apple Inc\u2019s failure to warn consumers about a FaceTime bug that had let iPhones users listen to conversations of others who have not yet accepted a video call.\nFacebook is facing a slew of lawsuits and regulatory inquiries over privacy issues, including a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation into disclosures that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nNew York\u2019s financial services department does not traditionally supervise social media companies directly, but has waded into digital privacy in the financial sector and could have oversight of some app providers that send user data to Facebook.\nIn March, it is slated to implement the country\u2019s first cybersecurity rules governing state-regulated financial institutions such as banks, insurers and credit monitors.\nLast month, DFS said life insurers could use social media posts in underwriting policies, so long as they did not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, sexual orientation or other protected classes.\n}}
{{Facebook is making sure that users are exposed to the stories format on every platform they own. First, they brought stories to Instagram and called it Instagram Stories followed by incorporating the same into WhatsApp as Status updates.\nToday, Facebook has brought the Snapchat-like stories format to its Messenger as well and has named it Messenger Day. Essentially, with Messenger Day, a user can share and upload pictures and videos on to Messenger. They also have the option to put on an overlay of more than 5,000 frames, effects and stickers to those images and videos they upload. A fundamental feature of Stories be it Snapchat, Instagram or WhatsApp, is that they are short-lived. As such, the images and videos that go into Messenger will disappear after 24 hours.\nSo how does this feature work?\n1. Firstly, you need to update your Facebook Messenger app to the latest version.\n2. Then launch the Messenger app and tap on the camera button. Alternatively, you can tap on the \u201cAdd to your day\u201d button at the top of Messenger inbox.\n3. Take a picture, selfie or start shooting a video.\n4. Next up you can add effects, filters, text and frames or even draw over your image.\n5. Now tap the arrow icon on the bottom right of the camera frame and you will see an option to add the particular image or video to \u201cMy Day\u201d.\nSelect \u201cMy Day\u201d and you are good to go. The photo or video that you selected can be viewed by your friends for a duration of 24 hours only. You can also choose to make your \u201cMy Day\u201d story private for people.\nMessenger Day is rolling out on Android and iOS gradually.\n}}
{{Before Friday, almost every Silicon Valley insider was saying Facebook stock would finish its first day between $50 and $60 per share.\nIn reality, the share price at the closing bell was a pathetic $38.37.\nHow were these masters of the universe \u2014 some of them the most powerful investors on the West Coast \u2014 so woefully inaccurate in their predictions?\nFacebook closing price predictions were coming in fast and furious over the past several weeks, but as Facebook\u2019s pre-trading pop fizzled, estimates dwindled lower and lower.\nStill, few thought the price would dip as low as it did \u2014 almost a full $4 below the $42 opening price and just 37 cents higher than Facebook\u2019s offering price.\nHere\u2019s a graph we made to name and shame (just kidding \u2026 sorta) those who aimed way, way too high on Facebook\u2019s value in the open market.\nIf you don\u2019t recognize the last names, you probably don\u2019t have your head deep enough inside the navel of startup culture, in which case, good for you!

As the opening bell rang, we published their conservative estimates \u2014 low $40s, maybe $44 by the end of the year.\nOf all the Valley dudes and dudettes we called, however, only one man gave an accurate estimate of Facebook\u2019s closing price. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of this guess-how-many-jellybeans-are-in-Facebook\u2019s-jar contest is \u2026 Menlo Ventures managing director Mark Siegel!\nSiegel told us the day before the IPO that he thought the company\u2019s $38 asking price \u201ccertainly fully values the company based on today\u2019s financial metrics. I think they know how oversubscribed their book is, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to leave too much money on the table.\u201d\nWhen we floated the $60 figure by him, he practically snurffled his coffee in surprise, saying there was \u201cno way, not a chance\u201d Facebook\u2019s numbers would get that high any time within the next year or so.\nSiegel bought his Facebook shares today, as did fellow Menlo Ventures VC Shervin Pishevar (who guessed $63) and Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital (who guessed $56).\nBut for those of you who didn\u2019t hit your closing-price target Friday, don\u2019t dismay.

{{Facebook's big F8 Developer Conference is right around the corner \u2014 and if you're planning on heading to San Jose to attend in person next month, Facebook has a clear message for you: don't be an insensitive, selfish asshole.\nVisitors to the Code of Conduct section of the event's page have been greeted by an extensive set of community guidelines and policies regarding prohibited behavior. The list encapsulates just about everything you'd hope wouldn't be tolerated in the nearest middle school locker room, let alone a professional conference held by one of the biggest companies in the world: name calling, inappropriate jokes and unwelcome touching are just a few of the outlined behaviors deemed \"not ok.\"\nIt's admirable that Facebook is making it clear it's not going to tolerate boorish behavior at the event \u2014 but really, the fact that the list is so specific and so extensive is a reflection of the sorry state of the tech industry's culture on the whole. With sexism scandals in the headlines and a reputation for leaving women and people of color out of the mix, it's fair that F8's organizers felt the need to set some strict rules.\nThe ridiculousness of the strict guidelines was first brought to light by Bloomberg's Shira Ovide.\nIt is terrible that Facebook has to give people a list of bad things they shouldn't do at a conference. pic.twitter.com/ml0n1YDC9s \u2014 Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) March 21, 2017\nHere's the full list of the code of conduct:\nThe list is really just common courtesy. Image: screenshot/facebook\nFacebook clarifies that it's list of banned behaviors doesn't encapsulate all unacceptable conduct. It's relying on people to use their best judgment. Let's hope no poorly behaved programmers make it their personal mission to push the boundaries and innovate their way to the top of the dbag charts. And that attendees keep things, you know, civilized by standing up for each other and reporting bad eggs to security.\nIt's unclear how much more extensive these rules are compared to F8 conferences past, but it's clear they have gotten Silicon Valley talking. There's no word on how Facebook will actually stamp out the bad behavior of offenders, but advocating for solidarity among attendees isn't a bad place to start.\nThe tech industry has a long way to go before its boys' club atmosphere is a thing of the past, and making clear declarations that bad behavior won't be tolerated at a prestige event is only a small sign of progress. Who knows, though \u2014 if groups of people who love to be described as geniuses are given basic instructions for common courtesy enough times, they might just start to learn something.\n}}

{{Zuckerberg will testify that Facebook has already taken steps to address the issues that plagued the site in 2016 by hiring additional security, disabling thousands of malicious accounts known to belong to Russian actors and demanding greater\u2026\nSAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) - Facebook is trying to demystify the ways in which it tracks people when they aren't directly using the website or app.\nThe company on Monday published a blog post that outlined its data collection practices less than a week after Mark Zuckerberg testified about his company in front of Congress. The CEO at the time promised to follow up on questions he couldn't answer on the spot.\nThe blog post, written by product management director David Baser, is mainly about third-party websites and apps that send data about their users to Facebook, regardless of whether those users have Facebook profiles.\nIn return for that information, Facebook helps those websites serve up relevant ads or receive analytics that help them understand how people use their services. The company gets this data from websites and apps that let people share or like posts using Facebook plugins, or log into the website with their Facebook accounts. Sites that use Facebook advertising or analytics tools also share data.\nFacebook also says it uses the data to improve its own ads and identify bots and bad actors.\nAccording to Facebook, the information it receives can include the name of the website or app, your IP address, your browser, what operating system you use and whether you've visited the third-party site before.\nFacebook says it can match that data to a Facebook profile, if the person has one. If not, the company claims the data does not get used to create a profile.\nZuckerberg said during testimony last week that the company collects data about people who have not signed up for Facebook \"for security purposes.\" That statement raised concerns about whether the company has \"shadow profiles\" with information about non-users.\nFacebook told CNNMoney late Monday that it does not have \"shadow profiles.\"\nBaser's post notably calls out other companies that it says do similar things. While Facebook has been getting the brunt of the recent outrage over its data collection and privacy practices, some methods are industry standard.\n\"Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn all have similar Like and Share buttons to help people share things on their services. Google has a popular analytics service. And Amazon, Google and Twitter all offer login features,\" Baser wrote in in the blog post. \"In fact, most websites and apps send the same information to multiple companies each time you visit them.\"\nThe blog post also reviews the types of controls people with Facebook accounts have over their data. For example, users can opt out of ads or delete their profiles.\nCopyright 2018 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\n}}
{{Mary Lou Jepsen on Life Post-Facebook and New Startup, \u201cOpen Water\u201d\nXconomy San Francisco \u2014\nI had long planned a phone call with Mary Lou Jepsen for this afternoon\u2014a prep session for a chat I will be doing with her a week from Monday night at Xconomy\u2019s Napa Summit, where she is the featured dinner speaker. It was to be a normal prep chat until I got to work this morning and learned that CNET, Engadget, and Tech Insider had all reported that the technology visionary was planning to leave her post as executive director of engineering for Facebook and Oculus, to focus on a new startup. It turned out she had talked about her plans last night during a keynote speech at the Women of Vision Awards banquet in Santa Clara, CA\u2014and the media outlets had all seized on the news.\n\u201cI was actually really surprised anybody picked that up,\u201d Jepsen told me (showing she doesn\u2019t fully understand what a big deal she is). So I took advantage of the call to ask her more. Some of our talk was off the record, but much of it was on the record, including quite a bit about her new plans and the thinking behind them.\nHer vision is broad and sweeping: it runs from a new generation of extremely high-resolution, affordable MRI machines for early detection of cancer, heart disease, and more, to a far-out time (or maybe not so far-out) when machines can read people\u2019s minds and people can communicate\u2014with each other and maybe even with animals\u2014via thoughts.\nThe idea \u201cleverages the tools of our times,\u201d Jepsen says, citing advances in everything from physics to optoelectronics to consumer electronics to big data and A.I. that can be combined to shrink the size, improve the functionality, and lower the cost of MRI. \u201cI could no longer wait. I\u2019m still writing up the patents. But I am incredibly excited to strike off on this direction,\u201d she says.\nThe startup, whose name has not previously been released as far as I can tell, is called Open Water (it could also be OpenWater, \u201cnot sure yet\u2026either is OK for now,\u201d she says). \u201cPeter Gabriel gave me the name. He is a great advisor,\u201d Jepsen says. In particular, she was inspired by this article he wrote for Edge.org, called Open Water\u2013The Internet of Visible Thought, in which he credited Jepsen for introducing him \u201cto the potential of brain reading devices.\u201d\nJepsen says she can\u2019t talk about funding and more specific plans for Open Water yet, and that she will remain at Facebook until August. But here are some highlights of what she could say:\n\u201cWhat I try to do is make things that everybody knows are utterly, completely impossible\u2014I try to make them possible,\u201d Jepsen sums up. She does that by leveraging what she calls her \u201cstrange background\u201d that encompasses physics, computer science, media technology, art, electrical engineering, and more. \u201cThat all comes together for me.\u201d Indeed, you can find more in this companion piece on that background, which includes stints at Google X, One Laptop per Child (which she co-founded), the MIT Media Lab, Intel, her own startups, and more.\nIn the case of Open Water, part of her motivation is her own health. \u201cI\u2019m a brain tumor survivor,\u201d she says. She had surgery to remove a brain tumor in 1995, and since then has taken pills \u201ctwice a day every day for the last 21 years to stay alive.\u201d That has led her to read a lot on the side about neuroscience\u2014and think about how to advance the field.\nPart of the idea behind Open Water involves taking things at \u201cthe hairy edge of what physics can do,\u201d Jepsen says, and then \u201cusing my substantial capability in consumer electronics\u201d to make them possible at consumer electronics price points. She says there is a huge potential in the manufacturing plants in Asia that are primarily used to make OLEDs, LCDs, and such. Jepsen adds that these consumer electronics manufacturers have been mostly focused on smartphones for the past decade or so. But, she says, we\u2019ve reached saturation in mobile phones, and sales are declining. \u201cWhat I see,\u201d she says, are \u201cthe subcomponent makers being really hungry for what the new, new thing is.\u201d\n\u201cMy big bet is we can use that manufacturing infrastructure to create the functionality of a $5 million MRI machine in a consumer electronics price-point wearable. And the implications of that are so big.\u201d She says every doctor\u2019s office in the world could afford these wearable devices and use them for early detection of neurodegenerative disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, internal bleeding, blood clots, and more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a big idea, it\u2019s what I wanted to do for a decade. It\u2019s why I went to MIT [Media Lab]. It\u2019s why I went to Google,\u201d she says. \u201cIt turned out that Google really needed me to do some other stuff that was way more important to Google at the time. I\u2019ve been incubating this since 2005\u2026and I clearly see how to do it and how to realize it in a few short years.\u201d\nOne factor in advancing her idea was work published about five years ago by a group led by Jack Gallant at U.C. Berkeley, Jepsen says. The research group used a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner to track blood flow and oxygen flow and image the brains of people shown hundreds of hours of videos. You can read more about it here, but the main point Jepsen stressed to me was that the work (and subsequent work) has produced a library or database of sorts of how brains react to different images. A computer using artificial intelligence can then use such a database to basically look at MRI brain images in real time and interpret what people are thinking about or reacting to. This ability has been demonstrated at dozens of labs to gauge the brain\u2019s reactions to words, music, math equations, and more, she says. But the resolution is poor and the process is expensive, requiring people to lie still in big chambers inside a huge magnet.\n\u201cI was really struck by that, so I started thinking this is great, but we need to up the resolution,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s in my head, I\u2019ve got this plan. I\u2019ve got these inventions that I\u2019m working on, and my next step is to let myself pursue it full time.\u201d\nIt is easy to see the power of these ideas to help make MRI far more affordable and accessible. But for Jepsen, that is just Phase One. She talks about the ability to image human thoughts in new ways, for instance, by helping stroke sufferers who can\u2019t talk find a new way to communicate via their thoughts. Or for amputees to harness their thoughts to move prosthetics more naturally.\nAnd then she goes a step or two farther. \u201cCan you imagine a movie director waking up with an image of a new scene in her head, and just being able to dump her dream\u201d into a computer, she says. \u201dIt could be so much more efficient than the way we do it now.\u201d For musicians, she muses, this could be \u201ca way to get the music out of your head.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not all. \u201cMaybe we can communicate with animals, maybe we can scan animal brains and see what images they are thinking of,\u201d Jepsen says. \u201cSo little is known. Dolphins are supposed to be really smart\u2014maybe we can collaborate with them.\u201d\nIt all sounds pretty far-out, I know, and she says so, too. But given how long Jepsen has had these ideas in her head\u2014and how much work has been done in brain-machine interfaces\u2014perhaps the world is finally ready to receive her thoughts.\n}}
{{Mobile Madness is here at last. Xconomy\u2019s fourth annual mobile conference is set for today at 1 pm, at Microsoft NERD in Kendall Square, Cambridge. The event is sold out with a sizable waiting list that we are trying to manage as you read this. We are looking forward to an unprecedented crowd and a really fun cast of speakers.\nA quick preview of five things to watch for this afternoon:\n1. Jason Jacobs from FitnessKeeper will set the table with some thoughts on the state of the Boston mobile ecosystem and what entrepreneurs are working on. He will then moderate a panel on next-generation consumer apps. We\u2019ll hear a bit about what\u2019s coming down the pike from HeyWire (social communications) and Springpad (digital organizer and notebooks). And we\u2019ll hear some lessons from the former head of mobile products for TripAdvisor, now with mobile marketing startup Jana, and the head of LoseIt, the wildly popular weight-loss app. Together these companies represent a big slice of Boston\u2019s consumer mobile future.\n2. I recently dropped in on Seth Priebatsch from SCVNGR and LevelUp, who will join Bob Hower\u2019s panel on mobile payments and commerce. LevelUp says it has 100,000-plus users, making it the second largest mobile payment network in the U.S. behind Starbucks, interestingly. The broader shift to mobile technologies is important, Priebatsch told me, because it provides a great opportunity to cut out the middlemen in payments. It\u2019ll be interesting to hear how LevelUp, AisleBuyer, Paydiant, and others are advancing the state of the art in mobile commerce.\n3. A special session on \u201cBoston\u2019s mobile mafia\u201d will explore how mobile companies of the region\u2019s recent past\u2014like m-Qube, Quattro Wireless, Third Screen Media, Enpocket, Where, and Skyhook\u2014are interrelated, what their leaders are up to now, and what lessons they bring to the broader tech community. For example, Lars Albright, a veteran of m-Qube, Quattro, and Apple, is working on a new startup, SessionM, that grew out of his various experiences in mobile ad-tech. (\u201cJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.\u201d)\n4. What will Facebook\u2019s mobile advertising strategy look like, and how will it affect mobile tech companies? That\u2019s one big question that Michael Schreck\u2019s panel on mobile content and marketing will address. We\u2019ll hear from Celtra, Fiksu, Nexage, and Zmags on this topic and others\u2014including tips for marketers on reaching tablets and other devices, and some increasingly important privacy issues.\n5. Jennifer Lum will talk about her de-stealthed company, Adelphic Mobile, as part of our Startup Showcase. Adelphic is using interesting (if still a tad mysterious) technology to try to make mobile ads more relevant and targeted to specific audiences, thereby benefiting advertisers, publishers, and developers. The other startups giving pitches are ByteLight (indoor location positioning), Crashlytics (mobile-app debugging), Kinvey (mobile backend-as-a-service), and ViziApps (app development without coding).\nWe\u2019ll have another special guest at the event: Our Xconomy colleague and chief correspondent Wade Roush is in town from San Francisco. Wade was the lead organizer of Mobile Madnesses past, and he has lent his analysis to some current themes in the industry, which you can check out here.\nWe look forward to seeing you at NERD this afternoon\u2026be ready.\nGregory T.

{{Before Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia's tragic disaster Friday, some citizens of the island Giglio looked towards the sea to get a glimpse of the boat, following a Facebook prompt from a ship worker's sister.\nWhile head waiter Antonello Tievolli reportedly did not ask the captain to steer towards his native island, he told his family he would be passing by that evening and his sister shared his whereabouts with her Facebook network.\nPatrizia Tievoli, Antonello's sister, posted to Facebook Friday, \"In a short period of time the Concordia ship will pass very close. A big greeting to my brother who finally get to have a holiday on landing in Savona,\" (translated from Italian), the Telegraph reports.\nAs the Concordia approached the coast of the island Giglio, ship Captain Francesco Schettino told the head waiter, a Giglio native, \"Come and see, Antonello, we're right in front of Giglio,\" Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reports.\nThe captain went too far with the Facebook-cued stunt. The ship hit rocks, which tore through its hull, resulting in the boat's demise. More than 4,000 passengers were evacuated Friday night. Schettino was accused of inexcusable recklessness Monday, for his decision to steer too close to the island.\nWhen Tievolli finally reached the shore of his home island, he reportedly told his friends and family, \"I would never have imagined that I'd end up disembarking on my own island like this.\"\nDuring the Concordia's last voyage past Giglio Jan. 6, Patrizia also spotted the ship and posted to Facebook, \u201cI\u2019m signalling to them.

{{Share\nWith allegations that Facebook tracks users all the time, even those who have never used Facebook in the past, it\u2019s no wonder why privacy-minded folks aren\u2019t too thrilled with the social network. It looks like things will come to a head, though, as 27-year-old Austrian law graduate and privacy campaigner Max Schrems filed a class-action lawsuit against Facebook, reports Yahoo.\nThe lawsuit stems from Facebook\u2019s alleged involvement in PRISM, a leaked NSA program that allegedly had the U.S. government colluding with the social network for mass surveillance. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied the allegations, though the lawsuit also paints Facebook as an entity that breaches European Union privacy laws through the \u201cillegal\u201d trafficking of user data.\nIn total, 25,000 users have sued the social network, with each plaintiff claiming a sum of 500 euros ($540) in damages, making the total around $13.5 million.\nSchrems filed the lawsuit against Facebook\u2019s European headquarters in Dublin, which registers all accounts outside the U.S. and Canada. Because Schrems believes Facebook violated European privacy law, he was successful in filing the lawsuit in Vienna.\n\u201cBasically we are asking Facebook to stop mass surveillance, to (have) a proper privacy policy that people can understand, but also to stop collecting data of people that are not even Facebook users,\u201d said Schrems.\nFacebook\u2019s legal team believes the case is inadmissible under Austrian law, arguing that \u201cthere is no legal basis for a U.S.-style class action.\u201d Schrems\u2019 lawyer dismissed this argument, saying it lacks \u201cany substance.\u201d\nJudges presiding over the case, which was crowdfunded, will have to rule on this argument and the aforementioned points. The case is currently being heard by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the highest court in all of Europe.\nIf this case goes Schrems\u2019 way, this could set a precedent for years to come. Unfortunately, this case is unlikely to be decided very soon. We will keep you updated.\n}}
{{WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s No. 1 mission during his appearance before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday will be to defend against calls to regulate internet-based companies.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees joint hearing regarding the company\u2019s use and protection of user data, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\nThe prospect of new laws that restrict Facebook and other internet companies, however, is extremely unlikely not only because of a lack of political will and the effective lobbying of technology companies but because few lawmakers want to grapple with the sheer complexity of the technical issues involved.\nZuckerberg is scheduled to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees.\nHe is confronting combined outrage over how Russia used Facebook to spread divisive political propaganda during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how Facebook seemed unaware that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested personal data of about 87 million Facebook users, most of them Americans.\nSenator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said on Monday that while he believed new regulation was needed in the face of Facebook\u2019s twin scandals, he did not expect anything substantive to happen.\nHe attributed that in part to the format for Tuesday\u2019s joint hearing before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees that will give Zuckerberg an advantage, saying it would favor spectacle over thoughtful dialogue.\n\u201cHow in the world can you have 44 senators do a hearing that has a lot of substance when each senator only has four minutes?\u201d Nelson asked reporters on Monday.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after speaking with 33-year-old Zuckerberg, that he \u201cwas a very nice young man\u201d who \u201cobviously knows what he\u2019s doing and has a very pleasant personality.\u201d\nPRIVACY ADVOCATES OUTNUMBERED\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declined to say on Monday if new regulations were needed. \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific policy announcement on that front, but I think we\u2019re all looking forward to that testimony.\u201d\nRepublicans are generally against more corporate regulation and they are not persuaded that tech companies need more of it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt Facebook. I don\u2019t want to regulate them half to death,\u201d said Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a member of the Judiciary Committee \u201cBut we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.\u201d\nCompanies that have been victimized by computer hacks have been accused by lawmakers of failing to take adequate security measures to protect their customers\u2019 personal information.\nSenior executives from a host of companies including Target Corp (TGT.N), Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O), United Airlines [UALCO.UL] and Equifax (EFX.N), have testified before Congress on a variety of issues including network security and walked away with little more than a scolding and a temporary dip in stock price.\nPowerful lobbying forces assemble against any effort to convert public and political outrage into regulation, privacy advocates have said. Facebook spent $1.35 million on lobbying in 2011 and six years later spent $11.5 million, according to data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\u201cPeople have this idea that we are going to pass omnibus privacy legislation and it is going to be a silver bullet,\u201d said Alvaro Bedoya, a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken. \u201cThe reality is lobbyists outnumber consumer privacy advocates in Washington 20 to 1 or 30 to 1.\u201d\nInstead of major regulatory changes, lawmakers in Congress have offered narrowly focused legislation.\nThe Honest Ads Act, for instance, aims to address concerns about foreign nationals covertly purchasing ads on social media to influence American politics. It would require political ads on the internet to reveal who paid for them, much the same as ads on television and radio. It legislation has been stalled since its introduction last October, although Facebook endorsed it on Friday.\nCongress did pass legislation last month that chipped away at the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which for decades has guarded internet-based companies from liability for what users post on their platforms.\nThe legislation, which is expected to be signed into law this week by U.S. President Donald Trump, was aimed at penalizing operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. Internet companies have expressed worry that it could be the first step toward dismantling decades of a hands-off regulatory approach by Washington.\nTechnology industry officials said they also expected Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony to be long on political point scoring and short on legislative ideas.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand ad targeting and they will probably ask him a bunch of unrelated questions that play to their respective political bases,\u201d said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition on anonymity because his company had not authorized him to speak on the matter for the record.\n\u201cSo Democrats will ask about monopolies and Republicans will ask about anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley.\u201d\n}}
{{Forget about media outlets and Facebook \u2014 worry about readers.\nFacebook's 2 billion monthly users have come to rely on the social network as a way to keep up with the news. Now Facebook is limiting the reach of news publishers, leaving a vacuum to be filled with... well, it's anyone's best guess.\nThe change is simple. Facebook is going to show users more posts that their friends and family have either created, shared, or commented on. In turn, Facebook is reducing the reach of pages including news outlets. That may sound innocuous, but the shift turns up the dial on the signals that help amplify fake news. And there's no way to tell how bad this is going to get \u2014 not even Facebook knows for sure.\nWe're already seeing this in action.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed the changes will put more \"meaningful\" content into people's feeds. But previous tweaks and tests have shown there's plenty of downside to showing people less news. The New York Times published a story over the weekend that highlighted how Facebook's changes have had particularly negative consequences in countries where journalists are at risk and news media is censored. Publishers are having trouble reaching people with real news while fake news spreads.\nThis follows a report that Facebook was used to spread misinformation and propaganda in Myanmar, where the United Nations says the government is participating in the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.\nNow, the social network is kneecapping publishers, leaving its News Feed open for whatever posts can get the most comments.\nIt's unclear how users are supposed to deal with this change. The average person is probably not aware of the changes to Facebook, let alone in possession of a clear understanding that they're going to see less news directly from publishers. A person who pulls up Facebook in the coming weeks isn't going to think, \"OK, there are fewer news stories directly from the platforms I trust. I should be careful about what I'm seeing, and maybe go to news outlets directly.\"\nFacebook: Talk among yourselves. But not about the news! \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) January 16, 2018\nZuckerberg says that the changes are meant to improve \"well-being.\" Their research shows that \"meaningful\" posts from friends and family on social media can do this. How does Facebook tell what's \"meaningful?\" Facebook executives have said that comments are the leading indicator, especially longer comments.\n\"The research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long term measures of happiness and health. On the other hand, passively reading articles or watching videos \u2014 even if they're entertaining or informative \u2014 may not be as good,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.\nFacebook can't undo what Facebook did\nPeople may end up feeling better in the coming months after visiting Facebook, but it's hard to understand how they won't be subjected to more misinformation. People aren't going to stop using Facebook as a news source just because of this tweak. They're going to keep on visiting Facebook and expecting to see news.\nAnd they will see some news. There will be stories that your friends or family share and comment on. That sounds fine, except that this is exactly how fake news spreads on Facebook \u2014 and how politicians and interest groups have been trained by Facebook to maximize their reach.\nIt's no accident that Facebook became a destination for news and politics. The social network works closely with political campaigns in the U.S. and abroad, convincing them to spend big money to push their messages. That's included working with Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines who has been accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings and shuttering news organizations. Facebook has a team dedicated to developing tools for politicians.\nMeanwhile, Facebook's embrace of publishers made it a destination for news. Almost half of U.S. adults get news from Facebook. There's a good chance you're reading this after coming from Facebook.\nWhat we already know about how fake news spreads on Facebook makes this a scary proposition.\nHere's how: A group wants to spread a particular piece of misinformation or propaganda for whatever reason. They do this by paying Facebook to show this content to people who are likely to share it. Those people are shown these paid-for posts, and they then start spreading it around their network.\nExamples of this tend to center on politics and elections, but there are other types of scams circulating on Facebook. Right now, bitcoin and cryptocurrency are particularly hot.\nSo @facebook is *still* taking money from online con artists who advertise their scam using fake news stories https://t.co/lbu8dMunFE \u2014 Alastair Reid (@ajreid) January 14, 2018\nWe are left with a scary timeline: Facebook makes itself into a news destination. Facebook makes itself into a way for propaganda to spread. Facebook removes news and boosts signals that help propaganda spread.\nIt's hard to imagine Facebook hasn't taken this into consideration, but the past few years are littered with examples of the company not quite realizing what it has created or what's happening on its network, especially with regard to fake news. One former Facebook employee familiar with the News Feed said that the company's system is so complex that even its engineers don't know what will happen when they tweak the system.\nSo there you have it. Readers, who were trained to get their news from Facebook, are now going to see a bunch of posts based on signals that are perfect for the spread of fake news \u2014 after Facebook explicitly pushed governments to use its tools to get their message out.\nThat's bad news for readers \u2014 and their well-being.\n}}
{{This time instead of exposing users\u2019 data, a Facebook bug erased it. A previously undisclosed Facebook glitch caused it to delete some users\u2019 Live videos if they tried to post them to their Story and the News Feed after finishing their broadcast. Facebook wouldn\u2019t say how many users or livestreams were impacted, but told the bug was intermittent and affected a minority of all Live videos. It\u2019s since patched the bug and restored some of the videos, but is notifying some users with an apology that their Live videos have been deleted permanently.\nThe bug raises the question of whether Facebook is a reliable place to share and store our memories and important moments. In March, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told congress regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal that \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data \u2013 and if we can\u2019t, then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you.\u201d Between that misappropriation of user biographical data, the recent breach that let hackers steal the access tokens that would let them take over 50 million Facebook accounts, wrongful changes to users\u2019 default sharing privacy settings, and now this, some users may conclude Facebook in fact no longer deserves to serve them.\nFacebook user\nWhen TechCrunch asked Facebook about the issue, it confirmed the problem and provided this statement: \u201c\u201cWe recently discovered a technical issue that removed live videos from some people\u2019s Facebook Timelines. We have resolved this issue and restored many of these videos to people\u2019s Timelines. People whose videos we were unable to restore will get a notification on Facebook. We know saving memories on Facebook is important to people, and we apologize for this error.\u201d\nFacebook made a huge push to own the concept of \u201cgoing Live\u201d in 2016 with TV commercials, billboards and more designed to overshadow competitors like Twitter\u2019s Periscope. It eventually succeeded, with Periscope\u2019s popularity fading while one in five Facebook videos became Live broadcasts. But in its blitz to win this market, it didn\u2019t build adequate safety and moderation tools. That led to suicides and violence being livestreamed to audiences before Facebook\u2019s content police could take down the videos.\nNowadays, most users don\u2019t go live frequently unless they\u2019re some kind of influencer, public figure, or journalist. When they do see something important transpiring, Facebook has positioned itself as the way to broadcast it. But if users can\u2019t be sure Facebook will properly save those videos, it could persuade them it\u2019s not worth becoming a camera man instead of a participant in life\u2019s most interesting moments.\n}}
{{Facebook on Thursday unveiled its first major redesign of the News Feed since 2009, making the page more visually rich, and giving users new options to filter what they see by different feed categories like Music, Photos, Games and Close Friends. At first glance, the changes appear to be a win-win for users who want more control over their Facebook homepage, but the redesign may prove to be more of a mixed bag for marketers.\nFor brands, the biggest positive about the new changes is that there is suddenly more real estate for in-stream ads. Facebook has expanded the size of the News Feed itself and shrunk the right and left rails surrounding the Feed. \"Having a larger canvas to work with will be a real benefit to marketers,\" said Debra Williamson, an analyst with eMarketer. \"[Marketers] have always wanted more real estate and Facebook has always been more reticent to give them more play. By expanding the News Feed, that by default gives advertisers more room to play with as well.\"\nA Facebook rep confirmed to Mashable in an email that Sponsored Posts will appear in-stream in the new News Feed just as they do in the current version, only \"richer/bigger.\"\nGreater real estate isn't the only big perk for marketers. Facebook is emphasizing visual content like pictures and videos in the feed, which provides brands with the opportunity to get creative. Williamson expects that brands will be able to capitalize on this by increasing their use of imagery in Sponsored Posts and eventually, if not inevitably, turning to video ads. \"We didn't hear Facebook talk about video ads in this presentation,\" Williamson says, \"but certainly Mark Zuckerberg has alluded to the fact that there will be more video in the News Feed, so there's an opportunity for brands to display video.\"\nBeyond that, Facebook's decision to streamline the News Feed design across desktop and mobile is also a boon to marketers. According to Dan Slagen, SVP of marketing at Nanigans, this move \"reduces friction\" for advertisers planning out campaigns for mobile and desktop by ensuring a similar experience on each. \"You are able to take one message and put it in the mind of a consumer and you are really able to drive that message home,\" he says.\nHowever, the situation gets murkier for brands and marketers when it comes to the many new subfeeds that Facebook has introduced. Until now, content from brands and publishers appeared in a user's News Feed right along side posts from friends and family. With the additional feeds, users have a quick way to focus on only what their friends are sharing (through the All Friends category), or even more specifically, on what their closest friends on the social network are sharing. Any user who choose these options is effectively opting out of seeing content from publishers, businesses and influencers whose pages they follow, but who they are not in fact friends with.\n\"The friends-only feed could get a lot of the volume, which may be a concern,\" said Simon Mansell, CEO of TBG Digital. \"It might affect our ad delivery in the short-term if everyone starts using it.\" That said, Mansell argues it's a necessary risk for Facebook to take to ensure the quality of the \"core platform experience.\" Marketers may still choose to advertise in those feeds, but Mansell says they'll need to think harder about how to do so: \"If you're trying to focus on your friends, you have to be careful how brands interrupt in there.\"\nOn the other hand, the additional feeds finally provide brands and advertisers with a way to better target the appropriate audience on Facebook. Before, a Sponsored post from Sony might show up in a user's News Feed regardless of what the user was doing in that particular session. Now, a company like Sony might only choose to place a Sponsored Post on the Music or Games feed, where it's presumably more relevant to that audience. Likewise, if users check their Following feed, it essentially means they've opted in to see content from brands and publishers, which means promotional content placed in that feed might see greater engagement from users.\n\"With most changes like this, it is always going to affect some people positively and some negatively,\" said Mauricio Aguayo, senior social strategist with Rokkan. \"The user is now much more in control about what they want to see and they will be much more prone to engage with it because they've in essence raised their hand and asked to see this publication. But for awareness purposes and pushing content out, it may be a little negative.\" Aguayo speculates that Facebook may eventually offer brands and publishers the option to surface their posts in other feeds besides Following for an additional cost.\nFacebook, for its part, suggests in a blog post that the new Following feed will benefit brands and publishers: \"Thanks to a new 'Following' feed on the right-hand side of the home page, people will be able to discover more content from the Pages they like and the people they follow.\"\nFor better or worse, Facebook has also effectively downplayed the presence of ads in the right rail in order to place more emphasis on ads that appear in-stream. Not only is that problematic for marketers who rely on the sidebar ads as a cheaper way to reach users on the social network, but Williamson says it also undermines what has historically \"been a pretty big contributor to Facebook's ad revenue.\"\nThe assumption going forward, according to several of the marketing experts we spoke with, is that providing more real estate and more prominence to visual content will help Facebook command greater ad rates. While that's good for a public company still looking to show meaningful revenue growth to Wall Street, it also means advertising on the social network will likely become significantly pricier and more competitive in the future.\nImage courtesy of Facebook\n}}
{{It\u2019s going to get harder and harder for many businesses to reach fans on Facebook without paying for ads \u2014 that\u2019s the message of sales material that the company sent to partners, as revealed in an Ad Age report.\nA year ago, there were rumors that Facebook was holding back the organic (non-paid) reach of Pages in order to drive businesses to its ad products, but the company said it was just cracking down on spam, and the data seemed to bear that out. Now, Facebook admits that organic reach is declining, something it blames on the fact that there\u2019s just so much content (not to mention the fact that more and more businesses are building a presence on the site).\nIn the sales deck, Facebook first says it expects \u201corganic distribution of an individual Page\u2019s posts to gradually decline over time,\u201d then it suggests, \u201cto maximize delivery of your message in News Feed, your brand should consider using paid distribution.\u201d\nTo address the issue, the company published a blog post of its own that included a link to the aforementioned sales deck (embedded at the end of this post) and outlined the situation thusly:\nPeople are connecting and sharing more than ever. On a given day, when someone visits News Feed, there are an average of 1,500 possible stories we can show. As a result, competition for each News Feed story is increasing. Because the content in News Feed is always changing, and we\u2019re seeing more people sharing more content, Pages will likely see changes in distribution. For many Pages, this includes a decline in organic reach. We expect this trend to continue as the competition for each story remains strong and we focus on quality.\nBut even if, as Facebook says, this is just an inevitable consequence of more sharing, the situation could still seem unfair to some business, particularly if they\u2019ve put effort and money into acquiring a fan base on the social network. What\u2019s the point if their messages are going to reach an ever-decreasing percentage of those fans?\nWell, Facebook says \u201cThe fans you have matter.\u201d In fact, the sales deck lists a number of benefits to acquiring fans, including improving organic distribution and getting more insight about your audience.

{{As a vice president of investor relations and corporate secretary for Enron Corp.\u2019s board, Paula Rieker viewed the energy trading giant\u2019s inner workings as it rose to be a Wall Street darling and then imploded in scandal.\nBut even as she described how Enron founder Kenneth Lay downplayed or hid bad news from Wall Street in the last few months before Enron spiraled into bankruptcy protection in December 2001, she acknowledged Wednesday that in early November that year she sent him an encouraging note that called his leadership \u201cinvaluable.\u201d\nShe sent the note on the day one-time Enron rival Dynegy Inc. announced plans to acquire what was once the nation\u2019s seventh-largest company. Dynegy later aborted that plan, leaving Enron with no options except bankruptcy.\n\u201cI sent him the note because the merger between Enron and Dynegy was a dramatic fall for Enron and I was not sure that Mr. Lay could make that step down for himself,\u201d Rieker told Lay lawyer Bruce Collins on cross examination.\nRieker, 51, is the government\u2019s fourth witness in the fraud and conspiracy trial of Lay and former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and returned for a second day of testimony Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, Rieker told jurors how Skilling ordered abrupt last-minute changes to two quarterly earnings reports in 2000 to please analysts and investors.\nShe also told how Lay misled analysts by withholding from investors pessimistic financial details he described to directors as \u201clots of retooling.\u201d She said Lay infuriated the board months later when directors learned, after he quit as CEO in January 2002, that he\u2019d repaid more than $70 million in company loans with Enron stock in 2001, even as the company was spiraling.\n\u201cThey were outraged,\u201d she said of the board and quoted one member, John Duncan, saying: \u201cHe was using Enron like a damn ATM machine.\u201d\nAt the mention of the $70 million figure, Lay fidgeted with his red tie, frowned and turned to whisper to his attorney-daughter, Elizabeth Vittor, seated next to him.\nLay isn\u2019t charged with improper stock sales, and has said he sold stock back to the company because he needed cash to repay bank loans collateralized by his Enron shares.\nRieker is testifying against her former bosses as part of an agreement with the government after pleading guilty in 2004 to insider trading charges for selling stock after learning internally Enron\u2019s broadband unit had lost more money than anticipated.\nRieker is among 16 ex-Enron executives who have pleaded guilty to charges and are cooperating with prosecutors.\nHer cross-examination began late Tuesday, with Collins trying to show Lay didn\u2019t have to disclose sales of stock back to the company until later in 2002 and hid nothing from the board.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on the legal duty,\u201d Rieker said. \u201cI can only comment on what the board thought was right or wrong when they heard about it.\u201d\nRieker, poised and articulate and often speaking directly to jurors, earlier Tuesday said she learned in January 2000 from her then-boss, former Enron investor-relations chief Mark Koenig, that Skilling ordered a penny increase in company earnings-per-share figures for the fourth quarter of 1999 to match analysts\u2019 expectations of 31 cents.\nShe also said Koenig told her Skilling ordered a two-cent increase to reported earnings per share in the second quarter of 2000 \u2014 hours before they were officially released \u2014 so Enron could top expectations and generate Wall Street enthusiasm for its stock.\nRieker\u2019s testimony was stronger than that of Koenig, the government\u2019s first witness. While she said Koenig told her Skilling ordered the changes, Koenig stopped short of saying his boss explicitly issued such an order, testifying only that Skilling was authorized to do so.\nNeither Rieker nor Koenig addressed how the accounting changes were made.\nBut Rieker said Enron\u2019s stock price would have suffered if analysts believed the company fudged numbers just to meet or beat their expectations.\n\u201cAgain, it would have really hurt the credibility of Enron and would have hurt the stock price because for analysts, strong underlying performance was a good thing, and management changing the earnings just to beat expectations by 2 cents would have been a bad thing,\u201d she said.\nShe said Lay told analysts in October 2001 that retail energy contracts valued at $30 billion would be \u201cgrowing at very rapid rates for at least three, four or five years\u201d when he knew the values had been shrinking, Rieker said.\n\u201cIt was very misleading,\u201d Rieker said.\nThe same month, on Oct. 16, she said he ordered word of a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, which she later learned was an accounting error, pulled from the third-quarter earnings report \u201cbecause it really didn\u2019t have anything to do with the earnings,\u201d she said Lay said.\nLay mentioned the writedown during a conference call with analysts.\n\u201cAnalysts were confused,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was this buzz. They were irritated they missed it.\u201d\nLay and Skilling are accused of repeatedly lying to investors about Enron\u2019s financial health when they allegedly were hiding chaos and weak performance.\nThe two men contend there was no fraud at Enron other than a few executives who stole money, and negative publicity that siphoned market confidence fueled the company\u2019s flameout.\nSkilling faces 31 counts of fraud, conspiracy, insider trading and lying to auditors, while Lay faces seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. If convicted, both face decades in prison. Both sold millions of dollars in stock before Enron went bankrupt, but only Skilling faces allegations of improper stock sales.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON -- If you want to understand the real meaning of Thursday night's debate between Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders -- or the increasingly ugly feud between their supporters -- you have to go back to President Barack Obama's election in 2008.\nObama's triumph brought together every wing of the Democratic Party and inspired a generation of young voters: idealists who wanted a complete break from the Bush years, centrists who were angry about the Iraq War, radicals who wanted to reshape the financial system, bankers who concluded Obama would get the economy back on track, and many, many more. Each faction projected its own worldview onto Obama, believing he would pursue their own particular vision of the future.\nThat was impossible. And so, committed Democrats have been fighting about Obama ever since he entered office. The meaning of his presidency and what it could have been are not simply topics of academic debate -- they cut right to the emotional core of why many people got involved in Democratic Party politics, and why they identify as Democrats at all.\nObama will probably be remembered by historians as a liberal champion. In the face of a hardline conservative opposition fueled by often-transparent racism, he expanded access to health care, implemented Wall Street reforms and rescued the economy from almost total collapse. It is this vision of Obama that Clinton is tying her own image to, attempting to present Sanders as a traitor to the cause.\nBut if Obama is remembered as a consummate progressive, it will be because he delivered corporate America's final conquest over the Democratic Party, and in doing so, enabled future historians to erase the party's anti-corporate wing from the narrative.\nObama began his presidency by essentially telling movement progressives to shut up and quit making trouble for his corporate-friendly agenda. Former Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs derided and insulted \"the professional left\" in press conferences. When liberal organizations advocated for a public option during Obamacare talks, former White House Chief Of Staff Rahm Emanuel pressured them to stop by threatening their funding sources. Obama economic adviser Christina Romer was sidelined after demonstrating that the economic stimulus package needed to be much larger than what National Economic Council Chair Larry Summers would accept. Obama has deported more people than any other president -- nearly 25 percent more than even President George W. Bush. He supported Medicare and Social Security cuts for years.\nWhile it's true that he faced scorched-earth opposition from Republicans, it was Obama who pressed for an entitlement-slashing \"Grand Bargain\" during the nearly catastrophic debt ceiling talks of 2011. This maneuvering on critical support for the elderly is what prompted Sanders in 2011 to advocate for a primary challenger to Obama -- a comment Clinton is now wielding against him as evidence of supposed liberal apostasy.\n\"I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that, with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president,\" Sanders said in 2011.\nAt the time, Sanders didn't come out and say Obama should be replaced -- only that the prospect of another candidate could hold his feet to the fire.\nAt first, that's how many political experts viewed Sanders' challenge to Clinton. When she publicly opposed Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact -- one of the biggest foreign policy goals of his administration -- it was a clear victory for the liberal wing of the party. Corporate executives love TPP; labor unions do not.\nBut then Sanders kept campaigning. He raised huge amounts of money from small donors and won a massive victory in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton maintains a wide lead over Sanders among black voters, and her debate performance Thursday night included an unsubtle effort to maintain that margin by hailing Obama's achievements.\nAfter several skirmishes, Sanders eventually dismissed Clinton's charges about his stance on Obama by pointing out that she had not always looked so fondly on the current president herself.\n\"One of us ran against Barack Obama,\" Sanders said, invoking the 2008 race. \"I was not that candidate.\"\nListen to HuffPost's analysis of Thursday's debate in the podcast embedded above. Subscribe here.\nNow that the South Carolina primary is looming on the calendar, Sanders could have referenced the Clintons' embarrassing, race-baiting tactics from eight years ago. He didn't.\nAnd because Sanders is uncomfortable on foreign policy, he also largely ignored a very well-documented dark side to the Obama years that many early Obama enthusiasts have since criticized. Former Attorney General Eric Holder publicly argued for the extrajudicial assassination of American citizens. A few weeks after Obama announced that the war in Afghanistan would not end on his watch, U.S. forces bombed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz. Obama has a kill list.\nBut Sanders was less shy about Wall Street. Voters, Clinton suggested, don't have to worry that big banks can influence politicians like herself with huge campaign contributions. After all, she argued, Obama got a lot of money from the financial industry, and he still signed the Dodd-Frank Act.\nSanders wasn't impressed.\n\"No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted,\" he noted.\nPeople forget that Obama hired Bill Daley, a former JPMorgan Chase vice president who had lobbied the White House against creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to serve as his chief of staff. The agency, which was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), ultimately survived Daley's entreaties, but he was a bank-friendly voice in Obama's ear for much of his first term.\nNone of this means that Obama has been a bad president. But it has long been clear which faction won out among Obama's early supporters: the corporate faction.\nFor many Obama enthusiasts, this can be overlooked. The Affordable Care Act made imperfect deals with insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms, but it did ultimately expand health care access. Obama went easy on banks, but he did pass some good new regulations. The overwhelming majority of economic gains under Obama have gone to the top 1 percent, but at least the unemployment rate is back under control.\nWhen Clinton challenges Sanders on the Obama legacy, she is, of course, making an identity politics play for black voters. But she's also making an implicit argument about the centrality of corporate elites and corporate favors to the very idea of progressive politics. Sanders' entire campaign is built on the rejection of that idea. And Democrats haven't decided which vision they prefer.\n\ufeffAlso on HuffPost:\n}}
{{UNITED STATES - JULY 27: Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., testifies about his bill, the 'Executive Accountability Act of 2009,' during the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on Monday, July 27, 2009. (Photo By Bill Clark/Roll Call/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON -- Wall Street billionaires, financial industry lobbyists and neoconservative hawks are throwing money behind a primary challenge to Rep. Walter Jones, a North Carolina Republican and veteran congressman.\nFrom afar, Jones may look like a conventional conservative. He opposes gay marriage and abortion, calls Obamacare a \"disaster\" and pushes for deep federal spending cuts. But he has angered GOP leaders and elements of his party's donor class by allying with libertarian-leaning lawmakers like Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), by refusing to vote for sanctions against Iran and by taking populist stances on Wall Street and campaign finance reform.\nThis rogue moderation cost Jones his seat on the House Financial Services Committee after the 2012 elections, and now it has brought powerful interests out to back Jones' main primary opponent, Taylor Griffin, a onetime George W. Bush administration official and former consultant to some of the most predatory financial firms.\nGriffin, a first-time candidate, raised $224,250 through the end of March, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. A Huffington Post review of these reports shows that Wall Street donors, financial industry lobbyists and war hawks provided $135,900 -- more than half of Griffin's funds. Jones raised $386,843 over the same period, with 43 percent coming from inside North Carolina and another 37 percent coming from corporate and interest group PACs and Native American tribes.\nThe Jones and Griffin campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe biggest single source of Griffin's funds were employees of Elliott Management, a hedge fund run by Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, and their families. They kicked in $46,850 to Griffin's campaign.\nSinger, known as a \"passionate defender of the 1%,\" a proponent of pro-war policies against Iran and a backer of right-wing elements in Israel, also funds a super PAC to help Griffin. Along with another pro-war billionaire investor, Seth Klarman, Singer has pumped $800,000 into the Ending Spending Action Fund, a super PAC founded by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, which is running ads to defeat Jones.\nThe Emergency Committee for Israel, a \"dark money\" nonprofit headed by neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol, has already spent a six-figure sum on ads targeting Jones for being \"the most liberal Republican in Congress,\" opposing sanctions on Iran, and obtaining the endorsement of the Zionist group J Street, which the ad labels an \"anti-Israel group.\"\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pro-Israel candidate and a not-pro-Israel candidate, and so we favor the pro-Israel candidate,\u201d Noah Pollak, director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, told National Review.\nJones was actually an early supporter of the Iraq War and the driving force behind redubbing french fries as \"freedom fries\" in the House cafeteria in 2003. But he grew increasingly anti-war as the battle went south. Ultimately, he became a leading Republican critic of the Bush administration.\nIn 2005, Jones blasted Bush official and leading neocon Richard Perle for not taking responsibility for the false intelligence used to sell the war to Congress and the public. In a 2013 talk before the conservative group Young Americans for Liberty, he laid into former Vice President Dick Cheney. \"Lyndon Johnson\u2019s probably rotting in hell right now because of the Vietnam War, and he probably needs to move over for Dick Cheney,\u201d the congressman said.\nRecently, Jones voted against further sanctions on Iran while the U.S. is engaged in talks with that country, abstained from a vote establishing greater military ties with Israel and signed a letter with progressive Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) calling on President Barack Obama to focus more on diplomatic solutions with Iran.\nNeoconservatives have responded by opening their wallets for Jones' opponent.\nFormer Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer, a $1,000 donor to Griffin, is fiercely opposed to the current nuclear negotiations with Iran. In a tweet sent after an initial agreement was reached in November, Fleischer wrote, \"The Iran deal and our allies: You can\u2019t spell abandonment without OBAMA.\"\nFleischer previously headed the pro-war group Freedom's Watch, which spent $17 million in the 2008 elections to defeat Democratic congressional candidates. The group was partially funded by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who recently called for the U.S. to fire a nuclear warhead into \"the middle of the desert\" in Iran.\nDan Senor, a former spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and an adviser to Singer's Elliott Management, has also donated to Griffin's campaign. Senor is a co-founder of the neoconservative Foreign Policy Initiative, which has advocated for increased Iran sanctions despite fears that they would scuttle the ongoing talks.\nOther Griffin donors supporting confrontation with Iran include Michael Goldfarb, publisher of the neoconservative Washington Free Beacon and treasurer of the Emergency Committee for Israel, and financial industry lobbyist Wayne Berman, a director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, which has also endorsed Griffin.\nThe hedge fund mega-donor Singer, though, sits at the nexus of Griffin's donor base of neocons and Wall Street. Singer has sought to position himself as a GOP power player by backing candidates who agree with certain key stands: support for gay marriage and immigration reform, a hawkish foreign policy and opposition to a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine.\nThrough his charitable foundation and personal donations, Singer has contributed millions to groups advocating for confrontation with Iran and hard right policies on Israel. Since 2008, he has given $3.6 million to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, which backs deeper sanctions against Iran. He has also funded such right-wing pro-Israel groups as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's American Israel Education Foundation, The Israel Project, the Middle East Media Research Institute, REPORT Inc. and NGO Monitor, according to his foundation's tax forms accessed at CitizenAudit.org.\nBut Singer's interest in unseating Jones likely goes beyond the congressman's dovish foreign policy stances to the source of Singer's wealth: a deregulated financial sector. Singer opposes major provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and deplores populist attacks against Wall Street, bankers and hedge fund managers. He has called income inequality a \"wedge issue\" and said that wealthy people are a \"vilified club.\"\nJones, meanwhile, is the last remaining Republican House member to have voted for Dodd-Frank. He is also an outspoken supporter of re-instituting the Glass-Steagall firewall between commercial and investment banking.\nFurther, the 10-term congressman is the only Republican House member who vocally backs campaign finance reform. He is the only Republican co-sponsor of legislation to match small donors' contributions with public funds as a way to boost the political influence of ordinary Americans. He has criticized Supreme Court rulings, including Citizens United v. FEC and McCutcheon v. FEC, that have increased the political power of billionaires like Singer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about fundraising,\" Jones said in November 2013. \"Why are we still in Afghanistan? Probably, probably because the military-industrial complex is doing pretty well financially.\"\n}}
{{The broadest overhaul of financial regulations since the 1930s is entering the final stage on Capitol Hill now that both the House and the Senate have passed legislation.\nLawmakers from both chambers will be named to a conference committee to hammer out a compromise bill.\nDemocrats, who control both chambers of Congress, will likewise hold a majority on the negotiating committee.\nRepresentative Barney Frank, who is overseeing the effort in the House, and his Senate counterpart Christopher Dodd have said they expect to produce a final bill by July 4 that President Barack Obama can sign into law.\nFollowing are snapshots of key players in the struggle over tightening bank and capital market rules:\nChristopher Dodd, Senate Banking Committee Chairman\nThe silver-tongued, snowy-haired Connecticut Democrat caps his legislative career with a big victory after shepherding the bill through the minefield of the Senate, book-ending his role in passing healthcare reform.\nThe battle is not yet over, however, as he now has to help forge a compromise bill that can win support in both the House and Senate.\nThe son of a senator, Dodd, 66, first won election to the House of Representatives in 1974.\nHe moved to the Senate in 1980 and was reelected four times.\nThe past two years have been tough, however, as he has had to answer questions about a sweetheart mortgage deal and whether he neglected his Senate duties while he pursued a presidential bid.\nHe decided not to seek reelection in January.\nBarney Frank, House Financial Services Committee Chairman\nThe Massachusetts Democrat last year emerged as the House's chief architect of Wall Street reform and a key ally of President Barack Obama, who has made an overhaul of financial rules a top administration priority.\nFrank's short temper and sharp tongue win him few friends on Capitol Hill, but he is both widely feared and respected for his ability as a lawyer, legislator and debater.\nHe pushed a bill through the House in December that achieved much of the administration's original reform agenda.\nFrank, 70, will play a central part in merging his bill with the Senate version.\nHe has said the two are more alike than different and is looking to push for a quick agreement.\nRichard Shelby, Senate Banking Committee's Top Republican\nThe patient, cool-headed senior senator from Alabama\u2014often the tallest man in the room\u2014held immense sway over the reform debate, but his efforts to weaken the bill largely failed amid widespread public support for tougher regulations.\nIn the end, he voted against the legislation.\nWhile he will likely be named to the conference committee, Shelby's influence is diminished given his opposition to the bills on the table.\nA lawyer with a distinctive Southern drawl, Shelby, 76, was first elected to the House in 1978 as a Democrat.\nHe moved to the Senate in 1986 and switched parties in 1994.\nBlanche Lincoln, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman\nThe senior senator from Arkansas, Lincoln added a hard-hitting measure that would require banks to separate their swap-trading desks from their core businesses.\nDodd tried to kill her swaps provision, but then backed off after Lincoln vowed she would fight to defend it.\nLincoln, 49, is facing a tough reelection challenge from the left and will be eager to show voters she is tough on Wall Street ahead of the June 8 runoff election.\nIf she is named to the conference committee, look for her to push hard to make sure her provision\u2014a main target for financial industry lobbyists\u2014is in the final bill.\nA self-styled \"farmer's daughter\" and former House aide, she was elected to the House in 1992 and the Senate in 1998.\nCollin Person, House Agriculture Committee Chairman\nA straight-talking Minnesotan, Peterson moved quickly on legislation to regulate over-the-counter derivatives.\nHis committee approved a bill that requires standardized swaps to go through clearinghouses in most cases.\nTransactions that involve \"end users,\" such as manufacturers, processors, utilities and airlines, would be exempt from clearing.\nPeterson is a skeptic of the Federal Reserve as a regulator and says there should be no bailouts of clearinghouses.\nHe supported the exemption for end users with the argument they did not cause the 2008 financial crisis.\nHarry Reid, Senate Democratic Leader\nFacing a tough reelection challenge at home in Nevada, Reid, 70, has nevertheless prodded the Senate to pass top Obama priorities such as the Wall Street bill, a massive economic stimulus package and landmark healthcare legislation.\nWhen the conference bill is completed, Reid will once again have to ensure that it has enough support to pass the Senate.\nA former boxer and Capitol Police officer, Reid practiced law in his home state before winning election to the state assembly and then becoming lieutenant governor.\nHe was elected to the House in 1982 and the Senate in 1986.\nMitch McConnell, Senate Republican Leader\nThe patrician senior senator from Kentucky is widely admired for his tactical skill and mastery of Senate procedure.\nThough he has not managed to defeat top Democratic initiatives, his ability to keep Republicans united in opposition has slowed their progress and ratcheted up their political cost.\nExpect McConnell to lead opposition to the conference bill when it comes back to the Senate for approval.\nMcConnell, 68, is a career politician and lawyer.\nHe recently suffered a stinging defeat in his home state when his favored candidate to join him in the Senate lost in the Republican primary to a Tea Party outsider, Rand Paul.\nPresident Barack Obama\nThe charismatic U.S. president wants to rein in the financial sector and end decades of deregulation, rising banker bonuses and reckless Wall Street risk-taking blamed for the 2008-09 financial crisis that rocked economies worldwide.\nObama, 48, unveiled a comprehensive set of reform proposals in mid-2009 and administration officials have been active on Capitol Hill during the legislative process.\nAdministration officials will continue to work behind the scenes to broker a compromise and Obama himself could continue to weigh in publicly to keep up pressure.\nPaul Volcker, White House Economic Adviser\nAt 82, the former Federal Reserve chairman is a legend in his own time.\nKnown for vanquishing stagflation during the Carter and Reagan administrations, the 6-foot-7-inch Volcker commands deep bipartisan respect in financial circles.\nObama brought Volcker into the White House as an economic adviser.\nThe two stunned markets in January with a three-part proposal to limit banks' proprietary trading, get them out of the hedge fund business and limit their future growth.\nThe proposals became known as \"the Volcker rule,\" and were included in the Senate bill.\nThey could be toughened further during negotiations between the two chambers.\nBen Bernanke, Federal Reserve Chairman\nThe stoic, bearded U.S. central bank chief survived sharp criticism in January of the Fed's failures ahead of the crisis, and won Senate confirmation to a second four-year term.\nSince then, the 56-year-old former Princeton University professor has had much success in restoring the Fed's image in Congress, fending off efforts to strip its bank supervision and consumer protection authorities.\nFed officials will likely continue to play a behind-the-scenes role as negotiations move forward.\nIn particular, they would like lawmakers to drop a House provision that would open up monetary policy decisions to audits, in favor of a milder audit plan contained in the Senate bill.\nTimonthy Geithner, Treasury Secretary\nAs President Obama's point man on financial reform, the youthful-looking Treasury secretary dominated the headlines from early to mid-2009, but Congress is now center stage.\nStill, Geithner, 48, and his deputies at Treasury are important emissaries for Obama in helping to push a deal.\nOnce the reform bill is signed into law by Obama, Geithner, and other regulators will play key roles in implementing it.\nSheila Bair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chariiman\nPopular in Congress, the outspoken, unflappable FDIC chairman is an advocate for tough financial reform and a fierce defender of her agency's turf as a bank supervisor.\nShe is a self-described moderate Republican, appointed by Bush. Her term expires in 2011.\nLike Bernanke, Bair, 56, was formerly an academic, having also worked at the Treasury Department, the New York Stock Exchange and on Capitol Hill.\nGary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman\nA former Treasury undersecretary, Gensler, 51, has tried to push Congress, with limited success, toward a firm crackdown on the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market that includes compulsory clearing of over-the-counter derivative contracts.\nCopyright CNBC\n}}
{{As Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign begins to vet possible VP picks, there\u2019s one name on the list that is making Wall Street donors nervous: Elizabeth Warren.\nThe Massachusetts senator has been floated as a possible VP pick since before she announced she\u2019d back Clinton. Warren was a coveted endorsement for the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is seeking to garner the support of Sanders\u2019s voters. As my colleague Nora Kelly noted, Warren\u2019s \u201cendorsement had been anticipated as the campaign of her progressive compatriot, Bernie Sanders, winds down. It\u2019s a loaded one: Warren has perhaps a singular capacity to united the Sanders and Clinton crowds\u2014except for Sanders himself.\u201d\nBut Warren\u2019s anti-Wall Street position is troubling to some donors. A Politico report published on Monday relayed those concerns:\nA constant theme that emerged in the interviews is that executives in the financial industry believe the first 100 days of a Clinton administration could feature potential deal making with Republicans, who are likely to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. The dream deal for Wall Street would be a combination of targeted infrastructure spending that appeals mostly to Democrats and corporate and international tax reform that could bring Republicans along. The fear is that Warren would make such a deal more difficult.\nBankers are nervous that if Warren is Clinton\u2019s running mate, she might move the presumptive Democratic nominee further to the left on Wall Street reform. Donors are warning that they\u2019d pull donations to the candidate if Warren is selected, according to Politico.\n}}
{{Alan Greenspan blames Wall Street Who is responsible for the financial crisis? Hint: Not poor people\nI confess, I was planning to have some fun at Alan Greenspan's expense today, operating under the assumption that his testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee would provide some delicious sparks as he defended his record as Federal Reserve Chairman.\nBut it would be too easy to mock his pronouncement that he is in \"a state of shocked disbelief\" at the advent of a \"once-in-a-century credit tsunami\" and the extent of a financial crisis that \"has turned out to be much broader than anything I could have imagined.\"\nAdvertisement:\nIn fact, it doesn't even seem like fun to rip apart his warning that the markets are already self-correcting in the wake of the last 18 months of disasters.\n[Today's markets] for an indefinite future will be far more restrained than would any currently contemplated new regulatory regime. The financial landscape that will greet the end of the crisis will be far different from the one that entered it little more than a year ago. Investors chastened will be exceptionally cautious.\nHey, if takes a global economic meltdown to chasten reckless investors, that's not too big a price to pay, right?\nBut like I said: Child's play. Boring.\nThe truth is, Alan Greenspan made a very important point in his initial testimony that bears repeating. The blame for the credit crisis belongs to Wall Street.\nThe evidence strongly suggests that without the excess demand from securitizers, subprime mortgage originizations, undeniably the original source of the crisis, would have been far smaller and defaults accordingly far fewer. But subprime mortgages pooled and sold as securities became subject to explosive demand from investors around the world.\nItalics mine.\nThat's right. Alan Greenspan went before Congress and did not, at least in his initial statement, blame Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or the Community Reinvestment Act or stupid homeowners or fraudulent lenders for the subprime meltdown and the ensuing credit crisis. He blamed the demand for risk from both the banks who would repackage the dodgy loans as exotic securities and the investors whose taste for these hotcakes could not be satisfied.\nAdvertisement:\nThe private sector created the incentive to make bad loans. The private sector, despite its vaunted reliance on a \"vast risk management and pricing system [that] has evolved combining the best insights of mathematicians and finance experts supported by major advances in computer and communications technology,\" failed to properly judge the risk inherent in those securities. The private sector, voracious for high-yielding risk, and unmindful of history, steered the global economic right off the tracks.\nAlan Greenspan said it. It must be true.\n}}
{{This will inaugurate a new feature here in the shebeen entitled, \"Yeah, he's going to do what he said he was going to do.\" Today's installment, thanks toThe New York Times, is regulatory policy.\nWhile many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries. \"This is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\" Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump's economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \"There are just so many regulations that could be eased.\"\nSorry, but if Stephen Moore is one of the economic advisers, then there are very few \"questions\" that remain. It's Springtime For e.Coli!\nMr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump's past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade. \"But Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\" said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W.

Per The Washington Post:\nThe company has said the so-called Avoca plaintiffs can't appeal the judge's order because it enforces the status quo already created by an injunction agreed to in the 2014 settlement barring \"trust derivative\" or duplicative claims, but the plaintiffs argued Monday their claims aren't trust derivative, so they aren't barred. \"Kerr-McGee praises itself for having entered into one of the largest environmental and toxic tort settlements in U.S. history, but it ignores that its payment was in response to the equally historic pollution that it created,\" the plaintiffs said.mThe residents' consolidated case involves more than 4,000 workers, residents and former residents of the area surrounding the shuttered plant in northeastern Pennsylvania. The group has recovered a small share of the proceeds from the adversary case against Kerr-McGee and its parent, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., but have said they have only begun to be compensated for their losses. \"Many have died and many more are critically and terminally ill,\" the plaintiffs said. \"While it is true that the Avoca plaintiffs have had a small taste of the apple, they have received far less than will make them even approximately whole.\"\nThe Market will get these people justice.

Analysts had expected the company to generate $1.07 billion in revenue.\n\u201cAs we manage our business with resilience in a challenging time in our history, we are leveraging our strengths for a more promising road ahead,\u201d said Matt Levatich, president and CEO. \u201cWe are investing to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders and we are optimizing our business to drive profitability and cash flow.\u201d\nThe company continues to expect to ship 231,000 to 236,000 motorcycles total in 2018, with about 45,800 to 50,800 shipping in the fourth quarter.\nLevatich rolled out an aggressive \u201cmore roads to Harley\u201d growth plan in July that includes an expanded lineup of lighter motorcycles, smaller urban retail stores, a new digital strategy and an international push as U.S. sales fall.\nThe Wisconsin-based company plans to launch by 2020 a new platform of 500 cubic centimeters to 1250 cc middleweight bikes and an even smaller bike for emerging markets in Asia. The biggest Harley engines run at around 1,700 cc and weigh more than 1,000 pounds \u2014 making the new lineup a significant departure from its Hogs.\nThe company came under fire from President Donald Trump during the quarter. He criticized Harley after it announced plans in June to move its European market production out of the U.S. because of retaliatory tariffs from the European Union.\nBMO Capital Markets said Hogs have fallen out of favor with riders, who are trading them in for Indian motorcycles, another heritage motorcycle brand owned by Polaris and one of Harley\u2019s main competitors.\nSeparately, Harley-Davidson said it is issuing a voluntary recall for a hydraulic clutch assembly on all model year 2017 and 2018 Touring, Trike, and CVO Touring models as well as some 2017 Softail models. The recall affects about 238,300 motorcycles worldwide and will cost the company about $35 million.\nThis story first appeared on CNBC.com More from CNBC:\nObamacare could expand after the midterm elections\nThe most colorful iPhone is also the best buy\nBuy McDonald\u2019s as a safe haven in case of market downturn, says analyst\n}}
{{Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you. After it\u2019s relentless and breathless coverage of corporate stock option backdating, the Wall Street Journal has reaped the ultimate reward in journalism\u2014a Pulitzer Prize.\nWe\u2019ve been one of the unfortunately rare sources of criticism of the Journal\u2019s coverage of backdating. (Larry Ribstein and the Journal\u2019s own Holman Jenkins are also among the thin ranks of critics.) It always stuck us as unduly scandalized, uncritically assuming that it was all a day of executive greed and theivery and misleading about the nature backdating. But like the Spartans at Thermopylae, it seems we\u2019ve been overcome.\nIt was obvious that the Journal\u2019s editors were gunning big-time for the prize. They released a front-page story on backdating on the last day the nominating juries were meeting at Columbia. But there\u2019s no denying the reporting has had a major impact on the public discussion, as well as on corporate America, where chiefs have been toppled, prosecuted and, in one case, forced to flee the country.\nIt all started with a very simple idea\u2014get some reporters to start digging into the findings of a few Midwest academics who had observed that many stock options grant dates were improbable. They seemed to have fallen on a perfect day for granting options\u2014when the stock price was at an annual low. The academics concluded that it was more likely that the grant dates had been manipulated. The Journal simply followed up on this conclusion by naming names of the probable manipulators. It was classic muck-raking journalism that has succeeded beyond the dreams of most muck-rakers\u2014and, in the process, has thrown a lot of muck into the public\u2019s eyes.\nAnd yet. And yet. We find ourselves still able to hope that this might lead to something that would be even more valuable than the Pulitzer Prize: a reconsideration of the criminalization of corporate governance. With so many c-level executives now former executives, the stocks of so many companies besmirched by the taint of scandal, some of those formers paying heavy fines and possibly facing serious prison time, the public might start to wonder whether we\u2019ve pushed the Rudy Giuliani model of treating corporations like criminal families too far. A rollback of our rogue regulators might still be in the cards.\nWe apologize for our unusual optimism today. But as the champagne corks pop over at the Journal\u2019s headquarters in One World Financial Center, we\u2019ll comfort ourselves with the notion that the fall-out from the Journal\u2019s backdating reporting could ultimately result in Jeff Skilling seeing freedom sometime before the twenty-plus years he was sentenced to by a federal judge.\nJournal Wins Pulitzers For Options Probe, China [Wall Street Journal]\n}}

{{Some days it feels like the only thing worse than the gridlock on our streets is the political gridlock on funding the infrastructure upgrades that New York City desperately needs. Up to $60 billion of subway investment is required and fixing our city\u2019s public housing would cost another $32 billion. Without these investments, New Yorkers will continue to spend more time stuck in traffic or standing on the subway every year than they do on vacation. Some of our most vulnerable families will continue shiver through another winter with broken heating and endure another summer scared to drink the water from their taps in case it contains poisonous lead.\nNo one has proposed a viable way to raise the money to pay for all this. Congestion pricing may have its merits, but it\u2019s only estimated to raise $1 billion a year. Using the revenue from marijuana legalization is another idea, but that would raise even less: just $300 million a year, the governor said last month. And there\u2019s a strong argument that marijuana revenue should be invested directly back into economic development and criminal-justice reforms in the communities that disproportionately bore the brunt of drug law enforcement for so many years.\nBut there is a way to break this political gridlock without raising subway fares or charging drivers a cent. For more than 100 years New York has had a modest tax on stocks traded, similar to taxes in London, Singapore and other global financial centers. Unfortunately, since 1981, 100% of our stock tax has been rebated straight back to traders.\nOn average, $11 billion is rebated to stock traders every year. That\u2019s a giveaway that could be used to create an infrastructure trust that would invest immediately in fixing the subway and New York City Housing Authority properties. This would provide 10 times the expected revenue from congestion pricing and 36 times more than marijuana legalization.\nWithin a few years, our subway system\u2014which underpins New York\u2019s economic success, reduces traffic congestion and lowers carbon emissions\u2014could be repaired and modernized. NYCHA would become a model for public housing, instead of the moral failure it is now. And New York would be a more livable city.\nOnce they were fixed, the ongoing revenue could be used to improve public transportation in areas like eastern Queens and to better connect Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, or to help build other infrastructure to reduce the impact of climate change. What\u2019s more, these investments would create thousands of jobs.\nIt will take courage to take on Wall Street. No doubt we will hear threats that the financial sector will abandon New York. I don\u2019t think that would happen. Critics said the same thing in 1905 when the stock transfer tax was introduced, yet Wall Street stayed and continued to grow. At times Wall Street has powered our city\u2019s economic success, but at other times its reckless behavior has plunged the world into recession. Ending the rebates of stock transfer taxes would result in Wall Street making a vital contribution to fixing New York City.\nThere\u2019s evidence to back this up. The International Monetary Fund says stock transfer taxes \"do not automatically drive out financial activity to an unacceptable extent.\" Trading firms are unlikely to move to other global financial centers because those cities have their own taxes: In London, trades are taxed at 0.5% and in Singapore, 0.2%. The European Union is working on a similar tax, bringing together existing taxes across its member states.\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that most of the tax burden would fall on the wealthiest individuals, not mom-and-pop investors or ordinary people with 401(k) accounts. For everyday people saving for retirement, a tax like this would be less than most brokerage and management fees. The people paying most of the tax would be those who treat Wall Street like a casino, gambling with Americans\u2019 jobs and livelihoods.\nThe New York Stock Transfer Tax already exists. There\u2019s a page for it on the state Department of Taxation and Finance website. It sets out the rates\u2014from 1.25 cents a share for low-value stocks to 5 cents for high-value stocks\u2014with a cap of $350 on any given trade.\nMaking New York a more livable city is not easy, but sometimes the simplest solutions are staring us right in the face. It\u2019s time we started using the tools we already have to make investments that will benefit all New Yorkers.\nRafael Espinal, D-Brooklyn, is a City Council member and candidate for public advocate.\n}}
{{Things won\u2019t be getting any easier for Wall Street\u2019s crypto-traders. Goldman Sachs is ditching its proposed cryptocurrency trading desk, citing yet more regulatory anxiety.\nBusinessInsider reports Goldman Sachs big-wigs recently shelved plans for a cryptocurrency trading desk. Instead, it will be focusing on its custodial service for industry players. It seems protecting cryptocurrency is more straightforward than selling it.\nTypically, larger investors are drawn to trading desks operated by respected industry figures, rather than the public cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance. Purchasing Bitcoin BTC from someone like Goldman Sachs supposedly makes cryptocurrency easier to stomach, particularly when concerned with being to exposed \u201cdirty\u201d digital coins.\nOriginally, the new trading desk was to be operational by the end of June. Instead, Goldman Sachs execs concluded that despite the interest, a framework does not exist that makes trading cryptocurrency legally compliant in the eyes of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAs it stands, Goldman Sachs believe that there are many steps to be taken before regulated banks can be permitted to buy and sell cryptocurrency legally.\nConsidering the ongoing resistance the SEC has shown advocates of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), this appears to be true. Recently, nine applications for Bitcoin ETFs were rejected in one day.\nA week earlier, a second attempt of the infamous Winklevoss\u2019 twins was shot down, leading to the creation of the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA) \u2013 an influential group led by the Winklevi with a goal of having Bitcoin et al openly traded on Wall Street as soon as possible.\nWith this news, though, Wall Street is going to have to wait a little bit longer, still.\n}}

{{When stocks rise without any kind of correction, consolidation or profit taking, it increases the risk that when stocks retreat \u2014 and they always do \u2014 the fall will be more pronounced than it would otherwise.\nSo last week's modest downturn after the Dow Jones industrials topped 11,000 for the first time in 4 1/2 years is considered very healthy. For one, it means that investors aren't falling prey to any irrational exuberance. And the fact that the markets ended slightly higher shows that bullish sentiment still prevails.\nThat sentiment will be tested in the week ahead, however, as the first crush of fourth-quarter earnings reports sweep the market. Given the positive sentiment on Wall Street, investors may be more inclined to buy if a company does well, but it's likely that they'll also be as unforgiving as ever if companies miss analysts' profit expectations.\nIn addition, important economic reports on inflation and consumers' moods are likely to affect trading in the coming week. Again, the overall mood on Wall Street remains positive, but only so far as inflation remains in check and consumers continue to increase spending.\nLast week, the Dow topped 11,000 for the first time since June 2001, and the other major indexes also set multiyear highs as investors continued to anticipate an end to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. But profit-taking ahead of earnings reports set in Thursday and Friday, limiting the gains. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.01 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.17 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 0.5 percent.\nThe U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nEconomic data\nA handful of key economic reports are due out the week ahead, the most important of which is arguably the Consumer Price Index, the Labor Department's measure of inflation on the retail level. The CPI, due Wednesday morning, is expected to rise 0.2 percent in December, up from a 0.6 percent decline in November. So-called \"core\" CPI, with food and fuel prices removed, is expected to rise 0.2 percent as well, on par with November's increase.\nThe market is particularly sensitive to inflation data right now, given that the Fed is only likely to stop raising rates as long as inflation remains low. Higher-than-expected increases in CPI could prompt more selling.\nOn Friday, the University of Michigan releases its preliminary report on consumer sentiment for January. The Michigan index is expected to rise to 93 from a 91.5 reading in December.\nSeveral hundred companies are reporting earnings in the week ahead, including Dow industrials Citigroup, IBM Corp., Intel Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Pfizer Inc.\nAmong the other prominent names to issue earnings this week, expected increased scrutiny for Apple Computer Inc., fresh off last week's MacWorld product announcements and bullish revenues. Wall Street is expecting nothing less than a blockbuster quarter, and Apple will have to deliver, especially after reaching a new all-time high of $85.04 last week. The company is expected to earn 62 cents per share for the quarter, up from 35 cents per share a year ago. Apple shares closed Friday at $85.59.\nGeneral Electric, another Dow component, is always a closely watched company _ given it's presence in manufacturing, healthcare, finance and media, it's considered a microcosm of corporate America. The conglomerate is expected to earn 55 cents per share for the fourth quarter, up from 51 cents per share in 2004. Shares of GE have traded in a relatively narrow range of $32.67 to $37.34 over the past year, closing Friday at $35.10.\n}}
{{Since being evicted from Zuccotti Park in the fall, some Occupy Wall Street protesters have migrated north a bit to Manhattan\u2019s Union Square, where police have been clearing them out nightly to prevent another encampment. But last night, the New York Times reports, some occupiers spent the night, albeit on the sidewalk instead of in the park. Citing the 2000 decision Metropolitan Council Inc. v. Safir, which said overnight stays on sidewalks are an acceptable form of protest, demonstrators curled up outside banks on 14th Street.\n\u201cIt is our First Amendment right to sleep on the street!\u201d read fliers passed around by protesters. \u201cLets go to sleep,\u201d they chanted. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t block doors or take up more than half the sidewalk there is no disorderly conduct,\u201d one demonstrator explained. For once, the NYPD arrested no one.\nMeanwhile, The Nation has a larger look today at Occupy\u2019s tactics moving forward, and explores a potential divide between the movement and some more established groups that share, or have co-opted, similar messaging. The 99 Percent Spring, which hopes to inspire direct, non-violent action, is being organized by MoveOn.org, with support from Greenpeace, the Working Families Party, and more, which leaves some protesters uneasy:\nMany Occupiers view MoveOn as an extension of the Democratic Party, since the group first rose to prominence supporting Democratic and progressive candidates and attacking right-wing figures. Conversely, Occupy is a movement that tends to view both the Democrats and Republicans as being culpable for growing class inequality and the corporate takeover of America.\nYet, when it comes to planned Occupy marches and events like the \u201cgeneral strike\u201d on May 1, bodies are bodies, so everyone should probably try to play nice.\n}}

These new images may be the first step in advertising the film and presumably a poster and a trailer won\u2019t be too far behind. As for the images themselves, they look good but I\u2019m not so much excited to see Douglas return as Gordon Gekko, but to see Josh Brolin hit another performance out of the park. He was fantastic in his last collaboration with Stone, W., and is going to be in two sweet-looking westerns with Jonah Hex this summer and the Coen Brothers\u2019 True Grit on Christmas. Throw rising star Carey Mulligan into the mix and I think Wall Street 2 looks better for its ensemble than Douglas playing his Oscar-winning role again.\nHit the jump to see the new images with USA Today\u2019s comments on each image. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps hits theaters on April 23rd.\nFor five more images from Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, click over to USA Today.\nSince Gekko\u2019s heyday, a new breed of ruthless investor has taken over the financial world as represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s banking kingpin Bretton James. In one of several scenes filmed at the Federal Reserve building, he and the chairman emeritus of the bank (Eli Wallach) have a meeting about the liquidation of a company run by Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella), who happens to be Jacob\u2019s boss and mentor. Stone at first considered Javier Bardem, who won a 2007 Oscar for his psycho killer in No Country for Old Men, for James. Instead, he went with Brolin, who played George W. Bush in Stone\u2019s 2008 biopic W. \u201cHe\u2019s the quintessential young investor,\u201d he says of the 40-ish James. \u201cA master of the universe.\u201d\nWinnie, standing outside her walkup brownstone in Soho, eventually suspects Jacob is in cahoots with her father, which causes a rift in their relationship. \u201cCarey is a strong young actress who brings class and quality to the film,\u201d says Stone, who hired the 24-year-old British breakout star after seeing her in An Education. \u201cI cast her blind without an audition. She was a perfect match for Shia, and brought his game up.\u201d In fact, the pair were so perfect, they are now a couple off the screen, too.\nGekko sneaks into a fancy Alzheimer\u2019s fundraiser at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (re-created inside the Cunard Building) so he can confront James, who used to be one of his allies. Events have caused Jacob to join James\u2019 company. \u201cJames doesn\u2019t know that Jacob is dealing with Gekko,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThere are a lot of betrayals in this scene.\u201d As well as a lot of decked-out extras to fill the 60 or so tables.\nJacob walks through the cavernous lobby at his new workplace near the former site of the World Trade Center an intentional choice on Stone\u2019s part. \u201cWe shot 56 or 57 days at 40-plus locations,\u201d says Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s the most locations ever done in New York. We shot in every borough of the city except for Staten Island, as well as on Long Island and in New Jersey. We used one little stage on Wall Street. And we shot in London.\u201d\n\u2013\nFor five more images from Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, click over to USA Today.\n}}
{{President Donald Trump is planning to impose a fresh round of tariffs targeting about $200 billion in Chinese goods, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing individuals familiar with the matter.\nThe timing of the announcement is fluid, two people familiar with the plans told CNN on Saturday.\nAccording to the Journal, the tariffs are expected to be set at around 10 percent, according to people familiar with the matter, a lower level than the possibility of 25 percent tariffs previously floated by the administration.\nThe move aims to increase pressure on Beijing ahead of planned high-level discussions and is intended to provide the U.S. leverage in talks over China's alleged practice of demanding American companies turn over technology in order to do business in the country, the Journal reported. But any imposition of new tariffs has the potential to further escalate trade tensions between the US and China.\nCNN has previously reported that the President had been pressing his administration to move ahead with the tariffs; Trump met with top aides earlier in the week and instructed them to proceed with the plan.\nThe Journal reported that individuals briefed on the plan said the specifics are still being worked out, but they anticipate an official announcement of the new tariffs on either Monday or Tuesday.\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not comment on specifics to the newspaper. She pointed the Journal to a statement released Friday. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\"The president has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China's unfair trade practices,\" she said in that statement. \"We encourage China to address the long standing concerns raised by the Unites States.\"\nThe next round of US tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to make thousands of products, including dishwashers, Fitbit fitness trackers and food seasonings, more expensive for American consumers.\nThe Trump administration has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to punish Beijing for what he says are its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft.\nChina, which has accused the United States of trade bullying, has matched the tariffs dollar for dollar. Beijing has pledged to hit back again with tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. exports, including meat, coffee, furniture and auto parts.\n}}
{{While American International Group Inc. sought to downplay its miscalculation of losses on a derivatives portfolio as not \u201cmaterial to the company,\u201d Wall Street was abuzz with speculation over whether the mistake could lead to a change at the top of the giant insurer and whether other insurers might be in the same fix.\nIn a Feb. 11 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, AIG revised earlier reports and disclosed that it now estimates that its unrealized losses on a credit default swap portfolio within AIG Financial Products (AIGFP) would be just shy of $4.8 billion through November, more than triple its previous disclosure of $1.15 billion.\nThe company has not yet determined its losses on the portfolio in December. Its fourth quarter earnings report is expected later this month.\nAIG acknowledged that the almost $5 billion error in valuation was due to a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in its internal accounting procedures.\nThe news sent AIG shares down nearly 12 percent and has raised concerns on Wall Street.\nToday, AIG tried to calm Wall Street.\n\u201cAIG continues to believe that the losses are not indicative of the losses AIGFP may realize over time. Based upon its most current analyses, AIG believes that any losses AIGFP may realize over time as a result of meeting its obligations under these derivatives will not be material to AIG,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\nIn early November, AIG President and Chief Executive Officer Martin Sullivan told Wall Street that the company could handle its mortgage exposure and that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that AIGFP would be required to make payments with respect to these derivatives.\n\u201cWhile U.S. residential mortgage and credit market conditions adversely affected our results, our active and strong risk management processes helped contain the exposure,\u201d he said at the time.\nBut according to Fitch Ratings, AIG has \u201crelatively large exposure to the current U.S. residential mortgage crisis.\u201d\nAIG sold credit default swap contracts to holders of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. These contracts pay when there are defaults on the underlying debt. With the number of mortgage foreclosures escalating across the country, th value of these AIG\u2019s derivatives contracts is in question.\nFitch said that AIG had $505 billion in exposure to its credit derivative portfolio in late September, including $62.4 billion of CDOs backed by subprime mortgages.\nFitch has stated that it believes AIG will not be immune to potential losses from U.S. residential mortgage crisis, although at the present time the agency believes these losses should be absorbed by the existing capital base and future earnings stream.\nHowever, Fitch said there is now additional uncertainty to the potential impact on the financial statements. It has placed AIG\u2019s Issuer Default Rating, holding company ratings and subsidiary debt ratings including International Lease Finance and American General Finance on Rating Watch Negative\nAIG has said that it now has procedures to appropriately determine the fair value of AIG FP\u2019s portfolio. Fitch said it would assess these procedures after reviewing the 2007 audited financial statements.\nIf weakness at AIG FP leads to a rating downgrade at the holding company, Fitch said it believes the magnitude would be limited to one notch.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services revised its outlook on AIG and AIG\u2019s core insurance operating subsidiaries to negative from stable.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s credit analyst Rodney Clark said the valuation adjustment is \u201clikely to be significant, and will likely cause AIG to report an accounting loss for the quarter, more than offsetting strong fundamental operating earnings in its core insurance businesses.\u201d\nHowever, he added that he changes to the fair value measurements affect only the reported market valuation of the securities, and do not affect the ultimate economic losses to AIG under these contracts.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s said it believes that all financial firms engaged in similar business are facing substantial difficulties in credit default swap exposure; however, AIG is the first financial firm to disclose a material weakness in this area, which raises concerns about the valuation models and approach.\nIt could be two or more quarters before the valuation of these items becomes clear enough to understand the maximum downside risk, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nThere could be additional fallout for AIG from this episode. Wall Street watchers including Bloomberg News have spoken with investors and analysts who speculate that CEO Sullivan could lose his job over this. They also suggest that investor lawsuits and an SEC probe are possible.\n}}
{{(Reuters) - The company that owns High Times, a magazine devoted to marijuana culture, announced on Tuesday that it is launching an equity crowdfunding campaign ahead of its application for an initial public offering on Nasdaq later this year.\nThe campaign is intended to bolster the valuation of Hightimes Holding Corp while offering non-institutional investors greater access to shares than they would have in an IPO, said Adam Levin, the company\u2019s chief executive.\nFor the offering, Hightimes has set a price of $11 (\u00a38.3) per share, 10 percent below the price the company expects the shares to trade on Nasdaq. The company also announced that former Mexican President Vicente Fox would join its board of directors. Juan Garcia, a senior adviser to Fox, confirmed the announcement to Reuters.\nThe company announced its intention to go public last July, as Reuters first reported.\nIts renewed push for an IPO comes as marijuana companies have gained a foothold on Wall Street. Two Canadian companies, Cronos Group Inc (CRON.O) (CRON.TO) and Canopy Growth Corp (CGC.N) (WEED.TO), debuted this year on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, respectively.\nInnovative Industrial Properties Inc IIPR.N, a San Diego real estate investment trust that owns medical-use cannabis facilities, went public in 2016.\nU.S. cannabis companies face a roadblock to listing on the major exchanges. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law, though more than half of all U.S. states have legalized it for medical or recreational use. In Canada, however, medical marijuana is legal, and its senate recently voted in favour of allowing recreational use of the drug.\nMassRoots Inc (MSRT.PK), a Denver cannabis social media network, unsuccessfully applied to list on Nasdaq in 2016. Levin said Hightimes has gained pre-clearance from Nasdaq. As a media company, it does not directly grow or distribute marijuana, though it runs events at which vendors have sold cannabis products.\nA spokeswoman for Nasdaq declined to comment on Hightimes or whether U.S. federal law would bar it from listing on the exchange.\nLevin said the U.S. debuts of Cronos and Canopy Growth signal a growing acceptance of the industry.\n\u201cThe landscape is much different than it was several years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we initially filed, it was a big risk factor. No companies had been listed on the Nasdaq or the NYSE.\u201d\nHe also pointed to the White House\u2019s statement in April that the U.S. federal government would not crack down on states that have legalized marijuana as another positive sign.\nCannabis is still a budding industry: spending on the plant worldwide is projected to reach just $12.9 billion, according to Arcview Group, a cannabis investment and research firm. Canopy Growth, the largest Canadian marijuana grower, has a U.S. market capitalization of about $6 billion.\nLegal and regulatory barriers have limited funding opportunities for companies in the space, Isaac Dietrich, the chief executive of MassRoots, said.\n\u201cInvestors are looking for a pathway to liquidity, and that pathway is being cut off,\u201d he said.\nBut others in the industry are hopeful as more cannabis companies have found their way onto U.S. exchanges.\nDerek Peterson, the chief executive of Terra Tech Corp (TRTC.PK), based in Irvine, California, which grows and sells cannabis, said the company has taken steps to prepare for a listing on a major exchange, such as undergoing a reverse stock split on the over-the-counter market to boost its share price. Investors\u2019 search for deal flow in a sluggish IPO market will lead to greater acceptance of marijuana companies, he said.\n\u201cWhen the opportunity opens up, there will be a tremendous amount of institutional capital chasing it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n}}
{{\"If a graduating MBA student were to ask me, 'How do I get rich in a hurry?' I would not respond with quotations from Ben Franklin or Horatio Alger, but would instead hold my nose with one hand and point with the other toward Wall Street.\" -- Warren Buffett\nThere will come a time in the not-too-distant future when Wall Street banks won't be regularly chastised for ripping off customers, defrauding the federal and state governments, facilitating tax evasion, laundering money for sworn enemies of the United States, and manipulating bond, interest rate, foreign-exchange, and energy markets. When this time comes, however, it shouldn't be interpreted as a sign that things have changed.\nThe reality is that corruption is endemic on Wall Street. It was in the 1800s when Daniel Drew and Cornelius Vanderbilt cornered railroad stocks and enriched themselves on inside information. It was in the 1920s when the predecessor to Citigroup (NYSE:C) flooded the country with toxic Peruvian bonds. It was at the turn of the century when analysts touted companies like Enron. And it is today. Indeed, perhaps the only thing that's shocking about the financial industry's misdeeds is that we continue to be shocked by them.\nWall Street's latest brush with the law\nThe latest multibillion-dollar settlement serves as a case in point. On Wednesday, six major banks -- Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), UBS, The Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) -- agreed to pay a combined $4.3 billion to settle allegations that traders within their investment banking divisions conspired to manipulate foreign exchange rates.\nThis is bad in and of itself; but what makes it worse is the fact that the banks were doing so in order to take advantage of their own clients. According to the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial regulator in the United Kingdom:\nTraders shared information obtained [in Internet chat rooms] to help them work out their trading strategies. They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client \"stop loss\" orders (which are designed to limit the losses a client could face if exposed to adverse currency rate movements). This involved traders attempting to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example, to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought that currency for in the market. If successful, the bank would profit.\nOf course, the banks argue that these were the acts of a handful of rogue agents, and that the indiscretions don't reflect the official policies and practices of the companies themselves. Take the following responses from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup:\nJPMorgan Chase:\nThe trader conduct described in today's settlements is unacceptable. In addition to making significant improvements to our systems and controls, we have spent a lot of time reinforcing the high standards of conduct expected of our people. Although the settlements acknowledge our progress, further training and enhancements are ongoing and will remain a priority.\nCitigroup:\nCitigroup acted quickly upon becoming aware of issues in our foreign exchange business and we have already made changes to our systems, controls and monitoring processes to better guard against improper behavior. While today's settlements resolve significant investigations into Citi's foreign exchange business, as we have previously disclosed, several additional regulatory agencies and enforcement bodies are conducting investigations and making inquiries into this business. We continue to fully cooperate with these investigations and inquiries.\nA pattern of unsavory behavior\nI doubt the employee manuals at these firms instruct traders to manipulate markets and exploit clients. But the problem is that this isn't the first time allegations like these have triggered fines or settlements at the same banks:\nBetween 2012 and 2013, eight banks -- UBS, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Rabobank, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup -- paid $6 billion to settle allegations that they manipulated the London interbank offered rate benchmark, one of the most widely tracked interest rate indexes in the world.\nIn 2013, JPMorgan Chase paid $410 million in penalties and disgorgement for rigging electricity markets in California and the Midwest.\nAlso in 2013, more than a dozen major banks paid a combined $9.3 billion to make amends for systematically submitting fraudulent documents to courts in foreclosure proceedings.\nIn 2010, Bank of America paid $137 million to settle charges of securities fraud for rigging bids in the municipal bond market -- and just for the record, the North Carolina-based bank was joined by the usual cast of characters, including JPMorgan Chase and UBS, among others.\nAlso in 2010, Goldman Sachs was hauled before Congress to answer for its role in constructing toxic derivatives that it then sold to unwitting clients just as the subprime mortgage market started to buckle -- here's a revealing portrait of virtually identical conduct at JPMorgan Chase.\nThus, the question is whether these practices are indeed isolated incidences of employee misconduct, as the banks would like us to believe, or instead whether they're indicative of a pattern of behavior that's endemic on Wall Street. I suspect it's the latter. And, for what it's worth, so does Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve's chief enforcement officer:\nThe hypothesis that this is all the result of \"a few bad apples,\" an explanation I heard with exasperating frequency a year or two ago, has I think given way to a realization within many large financial firms that they have not taken steps sufficient to ensure that the activities of their employees remain within the law and, more broadly, accord with the values of probity, customer service, and ethical conduct that most of them espouse on their websites and in their television commercials.\nAnd here's William Dudley, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, echoing a similar message:\nThere is evidence of deep-seated cultural and ethical failures at many large financial institutions. Whether this is due to size and complexity, bad incentives or some other issues is difficult to judge, but it is another critical problem that needs to be addressed. Tough enforcement and high penalties will certainly help focus management's attention on this issue. But I am also hopeful that ending too big to fail and shifting the emphasis to longer-term sustainability will encourage the needed cultural shift necessary to restore public trust in the industry.\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...\nOf course, it's impossible to forensically prove that corruption is woven into the fabric of Wall Street banks -- and, specifically, at companies with significant trading operations where the temptation to skirt the rules seems to be greatest. That's certainly what history suggests. And it's also what the ongoing regulatory assault on the industry implies. But, again, there is no way to quantitatively demonstrate this.\nBut what we can say is that there is a noxious air of impropriety that has enveloped these operations. And, rightly or wrongly, this reputational baggage subjects shareholders of these banks to more risk than, at least in my opinion, is warranted by any reasonable estimate of future returns. It's for this reason, in turn, that I believe individual investors would be smart to avoid universal lenders like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup in favor of their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space.\n}}
{{The Tuesday Market Minute\nGlobal stocks rally higher as investors react cautiously to news of progress in U.S.-China trade talks but remain unsettled by political uncertainty in Europe.\nChina's chief trade negotiator spoke with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to set out a \"roadmap\" for talks despite the political overhang of the Huawei CFO arrest\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou faces a third day of bail hearings in Vancouver as U.S. authorities seek her extradition on sanctions violation charges.\nU.S. Treasury bond yields hold steady ahead of a three-day auction run that will add $78 billion in new bonds to a market that is re-setting rate hike bets from the Federal Reserve\nU.S. stocks look book a second day of modest gains with Dow futures indicating a 95-point bump at the opening bell.\nMarket Snapshot\nGlobal stocks rallied Tuesday, with investors reacting cautiously to progress in U.S.-China trade talks but still unnerved by the ongoing political chaos surrounding Britain's Brexit vote, as bond investor prep for a series of Treasury auctions in the United States.\nChina's chief trade negotiator, Liu He, spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer by phone last night, China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement, and agreed to work towards the framework of talks set during the G20 leaders' summit in Argentina.\n\"Both sides exchanged views on putting into effect the consensus reached by the two countries' leaders at their meeting, and pushing forward the timetable and roadmap for the next stage of economic and trade consultations work,\" the Ministry said.\nThe call suggests the two sides are still willing to work towards a broader trade agreement despite the political clouds surrounding the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver earlier this month. Meng, 46, faces a third day of bail hearings today as prosecutors in the United States seek her extradition on charges she helped a company evade State Department sanctions on Iran.\nVery productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2018\nEarly indications from U.S. equity futures suggest Wall Street could take yesterday's modest gains into today's session, with contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked 365 points to the upside while those linked to the S&P 500 indicated a 37.5-point opening bell gain for the broader benchmark.\nA big portion of the Wall Street surge was linked to a Bloomberg report that suggested China is ready to substantially reduce tariffs on vehicles made in the United States and sold into the world's biggest car market.\nPresident Donald Trump hinted at such a move following his trade summit with China's President Xi Jinping earlier this month in Argentina, and the Bloomberg report, which cited officials in Beijing, could mark an important thaw in U.S.-China trade relations while providing more clarity for European carmakers worried about the fate of tariffs from both Washington and Beijing.\nThe report also followed data from China showing car sales have hit their weakest patch in five years.\nGeneral Motors (GM) shares were marked 2.7% higher at $35.35 each following the report, while Ford Motor Co. (F) jumped 2.5% higher at $8.73 each. Tesla (TSLA) was also on the rise, jumping 1.5% to $370.78 each in pre-market trading.\nPfizer Inc. (PFE) shares were another notable early market mover, slipping 0.9% in pre-market trading Tuesday after analysts at JPMorgan lowered their rating for the drugmaker amid concerns of the loss of exclusivity on one of its key pain treatments.\nJPMorgan analyst Chris Schott maintained a $46 price target for Pfizer, but clipped his overall rating to \"neutral\" from \"overweight\" as he argued the need for further expansion of the group's product pipeline following the patent expiration of its blockbuster pain treatment Lyrica next year.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds were marked at 2.881% in early European trading, with investors prepping for $78 billion in new supply from three separate auctions that start with the sale of $38 billion in 3-year notes later today.\nThe sales come just as investors are asking testing questions over the pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes next year, following weaker-than-expected employment data last week and consistent signals of slowing growth in the housing market.\nThe CME Group's FedWatch tool suggests a 75% chance of a hike from the Fed next week, which would take the target rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, but less than a 20% chance of a follow-up move in March.\nThe changing tenor of rate bets, however, hasn't blunted gains for the U.S. dollar, as investors pile into the greenback amid increasing political uncertainty in Europe, where both the pound and the euro have drifted lower, boosting the dollar index 3.4% since late September.\nThat uncertainty was nowhere more evident than in Britain, where the pound fell to a 20-month low of 1.2505 against the dollar after Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a key parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal with the EU that she herself admitted had no chance of passing the House.\nParliament will hold an emergency debate today, with the possibility of a no-confidence vote that could trigger a leadership change or, potentially, fresh national elections.\nHowever, the most likely outcome is that May will attempt to get further assurances from EU leaders this week on the so-called \"backstop\" portion of the agreement (that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland) before returning to the House in early January.\nThe pound bumped higher to 1.2620 in the opening minutes of trading in London, while the FTSE 100 gained 0.7% and markets in Europe jumped higher, with the Stoxx 600 rising more than 1.7%, as investors swept into beaten-down regional stocks.\nGermany's DAX index was marked 2% higher as domestically-listed automakers Daimler AG (DMLRY) and BMW AG (BMWYY) were marked 1.6% and 1.2% higher respectively following the China tariff story, while rival Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) surged 4% to \u20ac146.62.\nChina shares edged higher Tuesday, helping the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index bump 0.1% into the green, although the advance was somewhat offset by a 0.34% dip for the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo where investors continue to fret over the underlying strength of the world's third largest economy following a sharp downward revision to third quarter GDP.\nGlobal oil prices were active in early European trading, with investors citing the 'force majeure' on crude delivers from Libya, owing to the closure of a key pipeline, as supporting prices ahead of concerns over slipping global demand into the early months of next year.\nCFTC data also suggests futures and options traders have the fewest \"long bets\" on crude in more than two years, indicating a lack of faith in the ability of OPEC members to boost prices following their 1.2 million production cut agreed last week in Vienna.\n}}
{{Last week the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a half-page letter entitled \"No Need To Panic About Global Warming\" above the center fold of its Opinion page. The letter was signed by 16 prominent scientists and claimed, among other things, \"Perhaps the most inconvenient fact is the lack of global warming for well over 10 years now.\" Such a stark assertion would be devastating to the consensus on climate change if it were true. But it is not true. Data published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) show that global warming is real and well-documented:\nThis year tied 1997 as the 11th warmest year since records began in 1880...This marks the 35th consecutive year, since 1976, that the yearly global temperature was above average. The warmest years on record were 2010 and 2005, which were 0.64\u00b0C (1.15\u00b0F) above average.\nWhile the NOAA report used selected official data sets, the well-known global warming skeptic Richard Muller initiated the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project to re-examine all available data from around the world. The analysis changed his mind. On October 21, 2011, he summarized his conclusions about the reality of climate change, also in the WSJ, in an article entitled \"The Case Against Global-Warming Skepticism\}}
{{On Monday 13 February, just over three weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief Gerry Baker held a town-hall style meeting in the paper\u2019s midtown Manhattan newsroom amid mounting concern about the WSJ\u2019s coverage of the new president, which many staffers felt was too soft and too quick to downplay controversies.\nDonald Trump and Rupert Murdoch: inside the billionaire bromance Read more\nPoor morale underscored by two rounds of buyouts since September had been exacerbated by the recent departure of one of the paper\u2019s number-two editors for the arch-rival New York Times. But the meeting meant to reassure the newsroom only heightened tensions.\n\u201cInstead of clearing the air about the legitimate concerns of editors and reporters about balanced coverage of Trump, Baker led off with a 20-minute scolding about how we were indeed covering Trump correctly, and anybody who disputed that was wrong and wrong-headed,\u201d a recently departed Journal staffer told the Guardian. \u201cThat pretty much took the air out of the room. I and most of my colleagues were disgusted by his performance.\u201d\nConcerns about the way in which the paper was covering Trump spilled over into public view earlier this year, when newsroom emails began leaking out showing Baker criticizing his staffers for language he deemed unfair.\nGerard Baker. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images\nThe Journal, a New York-based institution more than a century old, remains one of the nation\u2019s most-read newspapers, with the power to move markets and shape political agendas. Like the Financial Times in London, it\u2019s long been the must-read for the business and financial class \u2013 with a business-friendly conservative editorial page to match \u2013 known for its deeply-reported stories and calm design.\nDozens of reporters, editors, and copy staff have left the paper in the past year, an exodus attributable to a combination of buyout incentives, poaching and frustration with management at the title which Rupert Murdoch added to his media empire a decade ago.\nThe talented staff that remain still produce memorable journalism. But when it comes to covering Trump \u2013 according to interviews with 18 current and former Journal staffers, some of whom have provided the Guardian with previously unpublished emails from Baker \u2013 many say this is no thanks to management.\n\u201cThe Journal has done a lot of good work in covering the Trump administration, but not nearly as much as it should have,\u201d another recent departee said. \u201cI lay almost all of that at Gerry\u2019s doorstep. Political editors and reporters find themselves either directly stymied by Gerry\u2019s interference or shave the edges off their stories in advance to try to please him (and, by extension, Murdoch).\u201d\nMeanwhile longtime observers like Sarah Ellison, a former Journal reporter and author of the book War at the Wall Street Journal about Murdoch\u2019s takeover of the paper, is not entirely surprised to see what has happened to Murdoch\u2019s paper under Trump.\nRupert Murdoch addresses a crowded Wall Street Journal newsroom on 13 December 2007 in New York. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP\n\u201cThis is the most access he has had to a sitting president ever \u2013 that is something he\u2019s tried to do and has done in other countries particularly with British prime ministers,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cHe\u2019s choosing his own personal access over having any journalistic clout.\u201d\nMurdoch bought the newspaper in 2007, but initially it was thought to be one of the few outlets in his portfolio impervious to his political influence. In the Trump era, some staff fear that seems to be changing fast.\nMurdoch and Trump have known each other for years on the New York scene, but what started out as a reportedly slightly chilly relationship has warmed considerably in recent years. As recently as April, the two were said to be talking \u201calmost every day\u201d (the White House has denied this). Murdoch\u2019s Fox News played a crucial cheerleading role in Trump\u2019s election and before that, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were known to go on double-dates with Murdoch and his ex-wife Wendi Deng, the two women remaining close even after Murdoch split with Deng. Throughout the campaign, Ivanka was a trustee of the $300m fortune allocated to Murdoch\u2019s daughters with Deng, stepping down only after the financial connection became public.\nWith Trump in the White House, he and the Australian-born media mogul have grown closer than ever, with Murdoch topping the New York Times\u2019 list of the president\u2019s outside advisers.\n\u2018Mr Elegant\u2019\nBaker, a British columnist who was promoted from the paper\u2019s deputy role in 2012, came onto Trump\u2019s radar early in the 2016 presidential campaign, when he moderated a Fox Business Network GOP primary debate in November 2015.\nTrump liked Baker\u2019s handling of the debate, especially compared to that of Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, who had grilled Trump on his treatment of women at an earlier debate in August. During Baker\u2019s debate, the future president largely evaded tough questioning and enjoyed more airtime than anyone else on stage. \u201cHe was unbelievably charming afterwards,\u201d Baker said of Trump at the time. \u201cHe came up to me and said, \u2018That was an extraordinarily elegant debate. You handled it incredibly well.\u2019\u201d\nThe Republican Presidential Debate sponsored by Fox Business and the Wall Street Journal on 10 November 2015 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images\nWhen Trump looked poised to clinch the GOP nomination in spring of 2016, Murdoch, who had cultivated others, warmed to Trump considerably. And around the same time Baker lectured the newsroom on the need to be \u201cfair\u201d to Trump in their reporting, Politico reported.\nIn October, as the Washington Post and New York Times were publishing groundbreaking coverage on Trump\u2019s taxes and treatment of women, Journal staffers were voicing frustration at how their paper was publishing \u201ctoo many flattering access stories\u201d on Trump and calling their own coverage of him \u201cneutral to the point of being absurd\u201d.\nThere was a lot of concern about the normalizing of Trump and that the Journal\u2019s coverage wasn\u2019t being skeptical enough Former WSJ staffer\nAfter Trump\u2019s surprise victory in November, Baker landed Trump\u2019s first post-election interview. And he wrote a column in the Spectator, the conservative British magazine, deriding US publications for pro-Hillary Clinton bias, accusing them of having \u201clovingly compiled their historic \u2018first woman president\u2019 editions.\u201d\nIn early January 2017, Baker upped the ante, publicly expressing reluctance to accuse Trump of \u201clying\u201d amid a bout of national media soul-searching over how to cover the incoming president\u2019s false statements, and lashing out at critics in a column mocking a \u201cfit of Trump-induced pearl-clutching among the journalistic elite\u201d.\n\u201cIf we are to use the term \u2018lie\u2019 in our reporting, then we have to be confident about the subject\u2019s state of knowledge and his moral intent,\u201d Baker explained of his approach.\nBy the end of the month internal discontent with the editor bubbled over into public view when staffers leaked a memo to BuzzFeed in which Baker asked them to stop using the \u201cvery loaded\u201d description of countries included in Trump\u2019s travel ban as \u201cmajority-Muslim,\u201d and suggested they use wording that hewed closer to White House talking points instead.\nThe cover of the Wall Street Journal in New York on 9 November 2016. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters\nBy the time of the February town hall meeting in the WSJ newsroom, tensions were running high between Baker and his staff.\nAnd they came to a head again this summer when Politico published a leaked transcript of an Oval Office interview Baker had carried out with Trump, after the Journal had printed a news piece and a partial transcript.\nThe Journal\u2019s published write-up of the interview was by no means a puff piece, and it included criticism of attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia inquiries that gave fuel to Trump\u2019s critics. But the full transcript revealed a number of lines embarrassing for Trump that the paper had ignored, from Trump\u2019s inquiry about Scottish independence \u2013 \u201cWhat would they do with the British Open if they ever got out? They\u2019d no longer have the British Open\u201d \u2013 to his claim that the head of the Boy Scouts had called him to say he had delivered \u201cthe greatest speech that was ever made to them\u201d the day before. (The Boy Scouts denied that.) The president referred to his son-in-law and key adviser Jared Kushner as a \u201cgood boy\u201d and said of countries with large populations: \u201cYou call places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and you say, you know, how many people do you have? And it\u2019s pretty amazing how many people they have.\u201d\nThe full transcript also showed that the Journal\u2019s White House reporters were sidelined during the interview by Baker, who dominated the questioning, speaking familiarly with Ivanka Trump about their children and a party they had both attended in the Hamptons in New York.\nPerhaps most revealingly, Trump recalled to those present his experience with Baker in the GOP primary debate. \u201cI call him Mr Elegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job,\u201d Trump said, to the deep discomfort of staffers who spoke to the Guardian.\nLast month, another series of emails were leaked, to the Journal\u2019s top competitor, the New York Times. In them, Baker again chastised his staff for the language they used to describe Trump, in this case in coverage of the president\u2019s erratic rally in Phoenix, Arizona, at the height of controversy over his remarks equating neo-Nazis with protesters opposing them.\n\u201cSorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting,\u201d Baker wrote in a late-night email to staff about the draft story. \u201cCould we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?\u201d\nEmail leaks\nThe leaks of Baker\u2019s emails were seen as evidence of rebellion from Journal staffers who felt unduly pressured to go soft on Trump.\nIn emails from June shared with the Guardian, Baker highlighted what he viewed as the Journal\u2019s best recent work, with lengthy lists of stories singled out for praise.\nNone of them were critical of Trump, and his top examples were not reported news but pieces of commentary flattering to Trump\u2019s worldview, one headlined \u201cThis time, Trump is right about trade\u201d and the other explaining why \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement will have less impact than expected\u201d. When he did mention reporting, he seemed more interested in highlighting soft-focus pieces on lunch trends that he noted performed well online, rather than anything about the president.\nWords have consequences and Gerry\u2019s terrible handling of things like why we don\u2019t call lies 'lies' had a chilling effect WSJ staffer\n\u201cIn a business where preening self-regard is in abundance, it\u2019s always been one of our most appealing qualities that we don\u2019t spend a lot of time celebrating our virtues,\u201d Baker begins in his email dated 2 June. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t let this becoming modesty blind us completely to the brilliance of much of our reporting. Our daily output does truly comprise a remarkable collection of some of the best journalism in the English-speaking world and I want to do a better job of acknowledging that.\u201d\nSuch values highlight a concern many Journal staffers have about the conservative exceptionalism of Baker, who still sometimes writes opinion columns \u2013 as he did after Brexit and the US election \u2013 in addition to his duties as the paper\u2019s top editor.\nIn particular, staffers past and present worry about editorial coverage seeping into the news side \u2013 what one ex-staffer described as \u201cmixing church and state.\u201d\nOn Wednesday night last week, a staffer contacted the Guardian about the latest obfuscating clause included in a Journal story on the debt ceiling that day. In it, Trump was described as having \u201ccondemned white supremacists in Charlottesville\u201d, obscuring the fact that his last word on the subject was rather the opposite.\n\u201cI almost threw up,\u201d the staffer told the Guardian of reading the story.\nHow the Journal sees it\nDefenders say Baker\u2019s approach is philosophically consistent with the paper\u2019s commitment to fairness, and that it only stands out so clearly now because rivals like the New York Times and the Washington Post have become more aggressive since Trump took office. The Post\u2019s new tagline, \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness,\u201d speaks to the urgency the paper\u2019s editors see in this moment. A full-page promotional ad in last weekend\u2019s Times declared, in a thinly-veiled reference to Trump: \u201cThis moment in history requires an explanation.\u201d\n\u201cThe Times and the Post have decided we\u2019re in a unique historical moment, and a different tone or stance are required,\u201d a current Journal staffer told the Guardian. \u201cThe Journal is not adopting that attitude.\u201d\nBaker did not respond to a request for comment, but a Journal spokesperson, Steve Severinghaus, defended the paper\u2019s approach. \u201cWe are covering this administration as we have all others, without bias or favor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAt a time when relations between government and media are strained, the Journal\u2019s singular focus on factual, unbiased coverage is essential. Our overriding obligation to be fair and objective is why the Journal is cited as the most trusted news organization in America,\u201d Severinghaus added.\nIndeed, a YouGov/Economist survey this summer found the Journal to be the most trusted outlet of the American news organizations surveyed.\nThe survey\u2019s pollsters pointed directly to the influence of Trump\u2019s attacks on the media for undermining trust in outlets like the Times, the Post and CNN, noting all had fallen in public esteem as Trump tweeted about \u201cfake news.\u201d The Journal is the rare publication of record that has managed to largely (though not entirely) escape that \u201cfake news\u201d slur, while \u2013 unlike, say, Trump-friendly outlets like Fox News, Breitbart and Sinclair Media Group \u2013 maintaining a strong commitment to journalistic standards and facts.\nDonald Trump holds up a copy of the Wall Street Journal during a campaign rally on 24 November 2015 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nBy adhering to the conservative worldview \u2013 newly supercharged by Trump \u2013 that all media skews liberal, Baker just may have helped the Journal straddle the divide between readers who want their information from a trustworthy outlet and those typically skeptical of journalism as an institution.\nBut many staffers aren\u2019t satisfied to be the best media voice in the Trump echo chamber, given the Journal\u2019s history as one of the top papers in the country, with 16 newsroom Pulitzer prizes under pre-Murdoch editor Paul Steiger between 1991 and 2007 (only one more has been added in the Murdoch era).\n\u201cI agree with the principle that media needs to be careful and wary of going too far,\u201d a source said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nOne staffer added: \u201cWords have consequences and Gerry\u2019s terrible handling of things like why we don\u2019t call lies \u2018lies\u2019 had a chilling effect.\u201d\nSome feel that a different approach is required with Trump who has turned the press and journalism itself into an enemy in order to generate political support.\n\u201cIt really came to a head after the election,\u201d a recent Journal departee told the Guardian. \u201cThe election was on Tuesday and it wasn\u2019t until Monday or Tuesday of the next week that the Journal wrote a single story about the legitimate anxiety that Trump\u2019s win had provoked within large sections of the population.\u201d\nBecause of that, he added, \u201cthis whole really interesting rebellion started to emerge across bureaus across the country. Everybody was living this story all of a sudden and it was playing out in their communities.\u201d\nSoon, a staff letter to Baker was assembled. \u201cThere was a lot of concern about the instant normalizing of Trump and that the Journal\u2019s coverage wasn\u2019t being skeptical enough,\u201d the former staffer told the Guardian. In the end they were convinced not to make this a group letter that might get out, he continued. Instead, a town hall meeting was held.\nBut the meeting did nothing to stop the normalizing of Trump at the Journal, then or in the months since.\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion section in February of 2017. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nWhere it leaves staffers\nSince the inauguration, the Journal has broken major stories that are damaging to Trump, on Kushner\u2019s business dealings, communications between Trump\u2019s inner circle and a Russian tied to the Kremlin and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the campaign. Another on Paul Manafort\u2019s ties to a Russian oligarch got considerable buzz.\nStill, the Journal is not competing with the Post and the Times for scoops and talent the way they have in earlier eras.\nIn November, Poynter reported that 48 Journal employees had accepted buyouts \u2013 a trend seen across the media industry. In the months that followed, more staffers opted for the door. The departures include two top White House reporters, well-respected political and policy reporters, veteran foreign correspondents, and virtually the entire national security team, some of whom were poached by the Washington Post.\nRecently, the Journal has made some effort to regroup after the loss of these stars, hiring a number of reporters in its Washington bureau, but not at a rate high enough to replace the talent they have lost and mainly involving more junior reporters.\nThe departure of Rebecca Blumenstein, the paper\u2019s deputy editor-in-chief, who had been one of the few women at the Journal in a top editorial role, for the New York Times, came as a particular blow to staff, leading to a call from reporters for more diversity in the newsroom.\n}}

{{Pick a channel, any channel: There\u2019s bound to be a playwright behind the show\nThe Wall Street Journal takes bogus trend story of the week honors with its Feb. 26 piece \u201cThe Teleplay\u2019s the Thing: A Growing Number of Top Playwrights Are Migrating to TV.\u201d After noting in the fifth paragraph that playwrights such as David Mamet and Theresa Rebeck \u201chave found a second home on TV before,\u201d the Journal makes this sweeping statement:\nBut some in the TV world say that the traffic [of writers] from stage to TV has never been heavier than it is now\u2014a result, in part, of the rise of more cable shows with literary aspirations and a TV marketplace that puts a premium on writers with original voices.\nThe mysterious source, Some in the TV World,is never actually quoted. Nor does the Journal ever offer a census over the decades of playwrights who have become tele-playwrights. It merely names a bunch of playwrights working in television\u2014Keith Huff, Warren Leight, Marsha Norman, Jon Robin Baitz, Tracy Letts, Lucy Prebble, in addition to Mamet and Rebeck\u2014and presents shaky anecdotal evidence. For instance, the Journal finds it significant that the majority of writers working on HBO\u2019s In Treatment are playwrights, that AMC\u2019s Breaking Bademploys two playwrights, and that one-third of the 200 applicants for writing slots on a new FX network drama were playwrights. They were expecting maybe plumbers?\nWould the Journal have run this bogus trend story had it spent two minutes on a Nexis search on the topic? The archives teem with similar stories about playwrights migrating to the electronic form. In 2007, Variety(\u201cTV Lures Moonlighting Playwrights\u201d) spotted a slew of playwrights writing for TV, including Baitz, Rebeck, and Leight, plus Adam Rapp, Craig Wright, Rolin Jones, and Eric Overmyer. In 2006, an Entertainment Weeklyarticle charted \u201ca few of the dramatists who\u2019ve traded the smell of the greasepaint for a steady paycheck.\u201d Listed were usual suspects Baitz, Rebeck, Leight, and Rapp as well as Paul Grellong, Diana Son, Craig Wright, David Marshall Grant, and Gina Gionfriddo.\nIn 2006, the Los Angeles Times hyped playwrights writing for the tube in a feature titled \u201cFrom Theater to TV; It Cuts both Ways; Sure Your Audience Is Bigger, But Look Out: So Are the Pressures.\u201d Among the playwrights named: Mamet, Rebeck, Jones, Gionfriddo, Wright, Grant, Leight, Overmyer, plus Aaron Sorkin, Peter Parnell, Marlene Myer, Jacqueline Reingold, John Belluso, and David Rambo.\nIn 2003, the Boston Globe covered the topic nicely without the bogus trend hype. In the Globe\u2019s view, the recruitment of playwrights to TV is long-standing entertainment industry tradition. Its list of playwrights working for TV include Wright, Sorkin, Mamet, Rapp, as well as Alan Ball, Kate Robin, David Schulner, Stephen Adly Guirgis, Nancy Oliver, Rick Cleveland, and Alexandra Cunningham.\nThe New York Times noted the \u201csteady flow of directors, producers, and playwrights out of the theater\u201d and into TV in a 1996 piece that name-checks writers Rebeck and Matt Williams. In 1994, the Los Angeles Times made a big deal about playwright Lisa Loomer\u2019s work on sitcoms, and in 1993 the newspaper reported the observation of Maria Gobetti, the artistic co-director of the Victory Theater, that one-third of the writers introduced to the public by the theater in the last 12 years were now doing most of their writing for film and TV.\nThe New York Times\u2019 1990 piece, \u201cTelevision Commissions Works by Playwrights,\u201d reported that NBC and Turner had hired Horton Foote, George C. Wolfe, and Arthur Kopit to write for them. A similar theme informs the Times\u2019 1989 article, \u201cPlaywrights Tread the Welcome Mat in Hollywood.\u201d Playwrights named include Richard Greenberg, Terrence McNally, Marsha Norman, Albert Innaurato, John Pielmeier, Michael Weller, Tina Howe, Jeffrey Sweet, and the previously mentioned Overmyer.\nA Los Angeles Times piece from 1988, \u201cThriving in Hollywood: Playwrights Can Work in the Industry and Love it\u2014Artistically and Financially,\u201d finds playwrights swarming Hollywood productions. (The piece reports the hiring of Jon Robin Baitz by HBO to write a screenplay\u2014his first!) A Los Angeles Daily News article from 1987 calls Mamet, Christopher Durang, Wendy Wasserstein, Terry Curtis Fox, and Overmyer \u201csome of the finest television writers in America.\u201d As proof that the Journal trend is no trend, I submit as evidence the Dec. 14, 1986, New York Times article \u201cPlaywrights See New Promise on the Small Screen.\u201d The article\u2019s playwrights in TV-land include Wasserstein, Mamet, Durang, Mart Crowley, Beth Henley, Paul Zindel, Bernard Slade, Andrew Bergman, and Charles Fuller.\nOnce you decant the hype from the Journal article, what\u2019s left? A half-interesting story! According to the Journal, TV seeks playwrights because they\u2019re good at writing dialogue-heavy scripts that can be filmed cheaply on one or two locations. These yakety-yak productions are called \u201cbottle episodes.\u201d Why on earth didn\u2019t the Journal make that the article\u2019s hook?\n******\nThanks to the observant reader who spotted the Journal article and Slate\u2019s Jenny Rogers.

Beyond its namesake Williams-Sonoma stores, it offers brands such as Pottery Barn, West Elm, and Rejuvenation.\nAs you may have noticed, there's been a trend over the past year: Retailers are getting hammered by Wall Street. There's a common theme within that trend, and that's that retailers lacking an e-commerce story are failing. That's why Williams-Sonoma is better positioned to rebound over the next few years: Its e-commerce business generates about half of its total revenue.\nThe e-commerce story is far from the only bullish factor in its investing thesis. Its brand portfolio hits many relevant demographics, including kids and teens, which enables it to be a leader in a less competitive younger demographic. West Elm is a newer concept for young professionals. Williams-Sonoma also has an owned supply chain -- it controls every aspect from product development to manufacturing, distribution and sale -- which enables it to drive costs lower compared to its competitors.\nThere's more good news for potential investors. It recently announced it would bump up its quarterly dividend by 5% for a total of $0.39 per share, roughly equal to a 3% yield at recent prices. In addition to its dividend, the company has a proven concept with an owned supply chain and room to grow overseas -- as recently as 2015 global sales generated only 6% of total revenue. Wall Street loves to hate Williams-Sonoma, but it could be wrong about this retailer.\nWhen wearables go out of style\nTravis Hoium (Fitbit): Few companies have gone from stock market darling to dud as quickly as Fitbit. And after a year when it lost $102.8 million on sales of $2.2 billion, there's not a lot of positive momentum for the company.\nThe challenge Fitbit has faced lately is similar to that seen by many product companies. It grew on the back of popular products, but when growth slowed and new products didn't sell as well as anticipated, an excess of inventory built up, leading to writedowns and financial losses. That was the story of 2016 and it's difficult to see an easy path back to growth or profits.\nWhat Fitbit needs today is focus. It was built on being a wearable for everyone, but today's wearables market is becoming more segmented and wearables from Apple and Samsung are better suited for the versatile mass-market crowd. Fitbit needs to stay focused on growing in one or two markets where it has a sustainable competitive advantage. Right now, I'm not sure even Fitbit knows which market it wants to focus on, which is a big reason this stock is so hated by Wall Street.\nOverpriced to the extreme\nTim Green (Snap Inc.): After soaring on its first day of trading, shares of \"camera company\" Snap Inc. have tumbled. A flurry of negative commentary and analyst sell ratings have helped push the stock down more than 25% from its peak. More than 15% of all shares have been shorted, with many investors having the same idea.\nThe big problem with Snap is its valuation. It is currently valued at roughly $23 billion despite producing just $404 million of revenue in 2016. That's a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 60. The company is losing boatloads of money to produce this meager revenue, posting a net loss of $514 million last year.\nBeyond the valuation, the Snapchat app's core functionality is being copied left and right. Instagram added a Snapchat Stories-like feature last year, and Facebook has now added a similar feature to its Messenger app. Snapchat's user growth is already showing signs of slowing, and the wholesale copying of its core features won't help.\nIs Snapchat anything more than a niche messaging app? We'll find out soon enough when Snap begins reporting quarterly results. If user growth slows further, it will be impossible to justify the outrageous valuation.\n}}
{{President Obama concluded his Hawaii vacation Tuesday and flew back to Washington, amid press reports that he would soon announce the addition of several prominent figures drawn from the financial industry to his White House staff.\nThe media speculation focused on William Daley, brother of the retiring mayor of Chicago, former Clinton administration commerce secretary, and currently a vice chairman at JP Morgan Chase, one of the top five US banks. Bloomberg News and the New York Times both reported that Daley was under consideration for White House chief of staff, as the permanent replacement for Rahm Emanuel, who resigned in September to run for mayor of Chicago.\nThe chief of staff position has been filled on an interim basis by Pete Rouse, a long-time Senate aide who joined the White House when Obama took office. Rouse is heading an effort to reorganize the White House staff, including selecting a permanent replacement for Emanuel, and could himself be chosen for that post.\nThe selection of Daley, which press reports described as \u201cnot imminent,\u201d would be the clearest signal yet of the Obama administration\u2019s shift to the right in the wake of the Republican victory in the 2010 congressional elections.\nDaley was one of the most right-wing figures in the Clinton administration, at least on domestic and economic issues. He spearheaded the drive to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, much favored by big business, and went on to a top-level career as a corporate executive, first at SBC Communications, then at JPMorgan Chase. He has served on numerous corporate boards, including at Boeing and Abbott Laboratories.\nIn the internal politics of the Democratic Party, Daley stood on the right, opposing any serious effort to fight the theft of the 2000 presidential election, when he was Gore\u2019s campaign chairman. In an interview last year with the New York Times, he criticized congressional Democrats and the White House, saying they had overreached and attempted policies that were too liberal. \u201cThe election of \u201908 sent a message that after 30 years of center-right governing, we had moved to center left,\u201d he said, \u201cnot left.\u201d\nWhomever Obama selects to implement it, the direction of his policy shift is not in doubt. In remarks to reporters as he ended his vacation, he urged Republican congressional leaders to work with the White House, and expressed the hope that \u201cJohn Boehner and Mitch McConnell will realize that there will be plenty of time to campaign for 2012 in 2012.\u201d\nReferring to the series of agreements that followed his capitulation to the Republicans over extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, Obama added, \u201cWe started making good progress on that in the lame-duck, and I expect to build on that progress when I get back.\u201d\nWhile Democratic and Republican politicians and the corporate-controlled media have portrayed the 2010 election as a mandate for the policies advanced by the far right, a poll released Monday by Vanity Fair magazine and the CBS news program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d found that the vast majority of Americans opposed extending tax cuts for the wealthy and making spending cuts in social programs to pay for them.\nGiven the choice of different options for reducing the federal deficit, 61 percent called for increasing taxes on the rich as the first step, while another 20 percent chose cutting military spending\u2015the second-most-popular choice. Only 4 percent favored cuts in Medicare and 3 percent cuts in Social Security, the \u201creforms\u201d that are being demanded by a unanimous chorus in the Washington political establishment.\nObama will soon fill one other top position, chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC). Former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers left the job December 31, four months after announcing his intention to do so. Obama has apparently not been able to find a suitable replacement from corporate America, despite a considerable effort to woo business support.\nPress reports suggest that the White House will select Gene Sperling, who formerly chaired the NEC in the Clinton administration and is currently an adviser to Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary. Sperling was identified with conservative, pro-business fiscal policies in the 1990s and played a significant role in devising the tax-cut agreement with the Republicans last month.\nAnother possibility is Roger Altman, former deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and an investment banker who runs Evercore Partners in New York.\nSperling has not been nominated for any position in the Obama administration requiring Senate confirmation because of possible questioning of his work at Goldman Sachs, one of the top recipients of the Wall Street bailout, where he raked in $887,727 for what was described as \u201cpart-time\u201d services in 2008.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Obama would probably name Ron Bloom, co-chair of the auto industry bailout task force, to a new White House post on manufacturing policy. This was presented as a sop to the trade unions, to offset any opposition to the nomination of Sperling or Altman to the higher-ranking post, since Bloom was an investment adviser to the United Steelworkers union. In collaboration with the unions, Bloom played an instrumental role in implementing the Obama administration\u2019s demand that auto workers accept devastating job and wage cuts to boost the profitability of the auto companies.\nOther shifts in White House staff include the departure of Ron Klain, chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, one of a handful of more liberal aides. He will become president of Case Holdings, the parent company of the investment firm named for Steve Case, the former America On Line chief executive. A former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore, Klain also worked for Case during the Bush administration.\nThe long-announced departure of David Axelrod, the top White House political adviser, is also scheduled. He is leaving to begin work on Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, and will be replaced by David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s campaign manager in 2008.\nThe personnel shifts between the White House and high finance have a definite sociological significance. Even the more \u201cliberal\u201d aides move easily from top government posts to lucrative positions in the financial industry. This poses no difficulty because the policies of the Obama administration are so organically aligned with the well-being of Wall Street.\nThe musical chairs aspect of the personnel switches\u2015Daley is being considered to replace Emanuel, who is running to replace Daley\u2019s brother as mayor of Chicago; Plouffe and Axelrod change places as chief inside and outside political aide\u2015also underscores the narrow, politically inbred and isolated character of the Obama administration.\n}}
{{NEW YORK \u2013 Wall Street turned cautious Tuesday after a two-day rally and as downbeat corporate news reminded investors that the economy\u2019s troubles won\u2019t soon ease. Stocks tumbled while demand for the safety of government debt spiked. NYSE, NASDAQ\nThe Dow Jones industrials fell 243 points, while broader indexes showed more moderate declines. Wall Street\u2019s uneven pullback illustrated the fragmented nature of the markets. Some investors snapped up hard-hit technology names, while a bleak forecast from FedEx Corp. made others fearful of stocks.\nDemand for ultra-safe Treasury bills spiked so high that investors were willing to earn no interest on their investments at a Treasury Department auction. Interest rates on four-week Treasury bills slid to zero from 0.04 percent a week earlier in a Treasury Department auction Tuesday.\n\u201cInvestors truly don\u2019t want to buy into this market, they are willing to lose money safely like in treasuries,\u201d said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer\u2019s Investment Research in Cincinnati.\nInvestors are also worried that companies\u2019 difficulties could make an economic turnaround difficult. FedEx Corp. cut its forecast for fiscal 2009 earnings and capital spending late Monday as the slumping economy eroded package deliveries.\nThe stock market\u2019s retreat wasn\u2019t a surprise given the steep advance of the past two sessions. But the reasons for the selling weren\u2019t simply based on two days of gains, analysts said. Wall Street is still trying to determine how badly companies\u2019 woes will dent profits and how soon President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s plan to introduce a flood of public works spending could aid the economy.\nAccording to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 242.85, or 2.72 percent, to 8,691.33.\nBroader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 21.03, or 2.31 percent, to 888.67. The Nasdaq composite index fell 24.40, or 1.55 percent, to 1,547.34.\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 15.67, or 3.26 percent, to 465.71.\nDeclining outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.44 billion shares.\nBond prices rose after the Treasury auction and as stocks fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.65 percent from 2.74 percent late Monday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, considered one of the safest investments, rose to 0.03 percent, from 0.01 percent late Monday. Still, the low yields indicate a high degree of investor unease.\n\u2014\nOn the Net:\nNew York Stock Exchange: http://www.nyse.com\nNasdaq Stock Market: http://www.nasdaq.com\n}}
{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nAs the Occupy movement perseveres and Google's stock price continues to skyrocket, it's no surprise that American youth don't want to work at investment banks. Citing a survey of 6,700 early-career professionals, The Wall Street Journal reports that nearly one-in-five young workers want a job at Google, making it the most popular potential employer by far. Apple and Facebook rank second and third drawing enthusiasm from 12.7 and 8.9 percent of those surveyed, respectively. You have to scroll down the list of results quite a bit before seeing the top-ranking bank, J.P. Morgan, at number 41. Attracting barely 2 percent of the young work force, Goldman Sachs ranks 46th on the list, right behind Macy's. Does the trend towards tech mean we're on track to reclaim integrity and stability in the American economy? Not so fast.\nIronically, previous studies suggest that the waning enthusiasm is a bad sign for the economy. More young people gravitate towards the high-risk-high-reward banking jobs during economic boom periods, but busts tend to follow those booms. For years, consultant Ray Soifer has been tracking the correlation between Harvard Business School graduates who take \"market-sensitive jobs\" at investment banks and hedge funds after graduation and the overall performance of the economy. As Businessweek explains, the percentage serves as a reverse economic indicator:\nThe percentage of Harvard MBAs entering market-sensitive jobs peaked at 41 percent in 2008, the year the Lehman Brothers collapse ushered in the financial crisis and the Great Recession. \u2026 So Soifer may have a good reason for believing that Harvard MBAs tend to have impeccable timing when it comes to jumping aboard sinking ships.\nThis year the number is back up to 38 percent, and if the Harvard MBA trend can be extrapolated to account for the rest of the young generation, we're led to believe that the bottom could drop out of the economy at any moment. Since the latest numbers suggest that young people want to work for tech companies don't match up with the trend of HBS graduates taking banking jobs, however, we're not sure it does.\n}}
{{SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street has regained an appetite for Apple as investors bet that the release of a 10th-anniversary iPhone and pent up customer demand will shore up shrinking sales.\nFILE PHOTO - The new iPhone 7 smartphone goes on sale inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\nThe largest component of the S&P 500, Apple remained a core holding of Wall Street throughout a decline in the stock in the first half of last year. But a recent rebound and speculation about an expected new phone have kindled additional investor interest.\nApple\u2019s 15-percent rally since mid-November pushed the stock to levels not seen in more than a year and boosted over 100 mutual funds that became shareholders in recent quarters.\nThe gains have come even as Apple struggles with slow global demand for smartphones, made worse by consumers in key growth regions like China and India preferring Android devices selling for under $200.\nThe stock is up 36 percent from lows in May of last year, when it was plagued by worries about iPhone sales, which fell in 2016 for the first time. The shares are now down 8 percent from a record high close in February 2015.\nMany on Wall Street expect Apple, which reports its fiscal first-quarter results on Tuesday, to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year with a dramatically improved model.\nApple has not disclosed details, but analysts have speculated about potential new features including better haptic technology, wireless charging and a curved display that many believe will attract consumers who have begun to lose interest in smartphones.\n\u201cWe think this is going to be a pretty solid launch, a really big one,\u201d said Brian Hennessey, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund, whose largest holding is Apple. \u201cI think even the bears would probably suggest that this product that\u2019s coming out is going to be pretty interesting and hard to ignore.\u201d\nThe number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 188 percent to 288, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 25 percent to 154, according to Morningstar.\nStrong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have arguably left a larger-than-normal base of customers now ready to upgrade to new devices in what several analysts have describe as a \u201csupercycle.\u201d\nCiting recent supply and demand checks, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty on Jan. 16 cut her estimate for December-quarter iPhone shipments to 75 million units from 79 million, and she warned that Apple would likely give March-quarter guidance below investors\u2019 expectations. But confident about pent up demand, Huberty raised her iPhone estimates for the fiscal year starting in October and said Apple remains a top pick.\nApple\u2019s recent stock gain makes the success of its next iPhone all the more crucial, said Trip Miller, managing partner of hedge fund Gullane Capital. Attracted to the healthy balance sheet and a price/earnings multiple that is low versus the S&P 500\u2019s average, the fund added to an existing Apple stake after the stock swooned last year. Apple currently makes up about 5 percent of its portfolio, Miller said.\nApple is rushing to expand music streaming and other services that provide recurring revenues in a bid to offset lackluster iPhones sales, which still account for 60 percent of total revenue.\n\u201cThey really need to have a big value-add in the next product they come out with,\u201d Miller said.\nAlso sounding a cautious note, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz downgraded Apple on Jan. 24 to \u201cequal weight\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d, warning that this year\u2019s new iPhones may not entice consumers increasingly content to keep their devices for three or four years, instead of two or three.\nApple\u2019s recent rally has left its stock trading at 12.9 times expected earnings, pricier than its five-year average of about 12.0 times expected earnings but far cheaper than the S&P 500\u2019s multiple of 17.2 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.\nAfter three consecutive quarters of declines, Apple in the December-quarter is expected by analysts to report a 2-percent increase in revenue to $77.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected by analysts to grow 5.5 percent, recovering some of last year\u2019s 7.7 percent decline.\n(This version of the story was refiled to fix spelling of \u201csupercycle,\u201d paragraph 10)\n}}

{{TerraForm Power (NASDAQ:TERP) has been an abysmal performer since its initial public offering more than four years ago, with shares losing 65% of their value over that time frame. Driving that decline was the renewable energy company's now-bankrupt parent, which led it on a buying binge that destroyed value instead of creating it.\nHowever, TerraForm Power is now under the control of a new parent company, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), which has a long history of creating shareholder value. Since taking over, Brookfield has instituted a strategic turnaround plan that's already starting to pay dividends. Because of that, TerraForm is beginning to catch the eye of Wall Street. That's evident after a couple of analysts upgraded the stock in the last month, motivated by their view that the company has a bright future.\nEnergized by the second quarter\nTerraForm Power showed continued progress on its turnaround when it announced second-quarter results in mid-August. That report caught the eye of an analyst at Oppenheimer, who upgraded the company's stock from market perform to outperform while setting a $14 price target, which was nearly 30% above the stock's price at the time.\nSeveral factors drove that bullish view. First, the analyst noted that the company's second-quarter report showed success in executing several \"critical\" initiatives. For starters, the company closed its acquisition of western European wind and solar company Saeta, which improved its capital structure so that it earned a credit rating upgrade. Further, the deal has opened the door for new opportunities in Western Europe, which the company is working quickly to capture.\nIn addition to that, TerraForm signed a new long-term contract with GE (NYSE:GE) to improve its wind operations. The company expects that GE will be able to reduce its costs while also enabling it to collect incremental revenue starting early next year, which is well ahead of the two- to three-year time frame it initially set. Those factors increased Oppenheimer's confidence that TerraForm Power can grow its dividend by 5% to 8% per year through 2022.\nThe risks are fading away\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, upgraded TerraForm's stock in mid-September from sell to neutral, while setting an $11 price target, which is a bit lower than the current price. However, while the renowned investment bank might not be quite as bullish as Oppenheimer, its upgrade is worth noting since it sees lots to like about the company.\nFirst, the bank noted that the risks surrounding the company are fading. Not only has the return reduction potential for the company's newly acquired Spanish assets subsided, but it completed the sale of new equity to fund that sale, lifting the overhang of uncertainty.\nMeanwhile, the company has improved the visibility of its growth prospects. An analyst at the bank noted this by writing, \"we see strong visibility to hit growth expectations under the larger platform including Saeta and a host of existing organic opportunities such as cost savings [and] repowering.\"\nThe company outlined this upside in its second-quarter presentation, pointing out that it has identified $416 million of potential organic growth investments, including holding the right of first offer to acquire several assets, the ability to buy out minority partners, and the potential to replace older wind turbines with newer and more powerful ones. On top of that, the company could also make third-party acquisitions with the help of Brookfield. Capturing half of the opportunities it has identified could add $28 million in incremental cash flow available for dividends, which is a 22% increase from last year's stand-alone level. That increasing visibility into what can drive growth improves the probability that TerraForm can achieve its dividend expansion plan.\nA lower risk high-yield stock\nTerraForm Power has come a long way since Brookfield took control last year by quickly putting a turnaround plan into action. Because of that, it was able to start paying a dividend again this year, which currently yields 6.4%. That success is beginning to win over Wall Street analysts, who see even better days ahead as the company starts growing its cash flow and dividend in the coming years. That steadily rising income stream is among the factors that make TerraForm one of the top renewable-energy dividend stocks to buy right now.\n}}
{{Wall Street analysts don't hold all the aces. Sometimes, the pros miss out on fantastic investment ideas. Getting in early on these under-followed story stocks can make you some serious money -- share prices often rise when analysts start their coverage, after all.\nWe asked three Motley Fool investors for some high-powered stock tips with low analyst interest. Read on for a quick introduction to Kroger (NYSE:KR), Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR), and WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC). You'll like what you'll see in these near-forgotten classics.\nA discount for this leading grocery-store chain\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Kroger): It wasn't long ago that Kroger was one of Wall Street's favorite stocks. But the supermarket chain has underperformed the market over the last two years and completely missed 2017's rally.\nThe main thing that changed was Kroger's sales-growth pace, which had been running at between 4% and 6% for most of 2014 and 2015. Since then, comparable-store sales dipped into negative territory and were stuck there as recently as early fiscal 2017.\nYet Wall Street overreacted to this decline, in my view. After all, much of it had to do with the industrywide price deflation that impacted rivals, as well. Kroger's sales volumes kept up a steady growth pace, along with its market-share gains -- so the comps' dip was likely temporary.\nOn the other hand, weakening industry dynamics forced the retailer to step away from its prior earnings growth target that promised investors profit gains of between 8% and 11%, plus a growing dividend. Instead, Kroger is likely to post lower earnings for fiscal 2017 as it invests in growth initiatives like lower prices, online ordering, and home delivery.\nThe good news is that these moves have put comps on pace for their fourth-consecutive quarter of improvements, and that should give Kroger solid momentum as it aims to double its addressable market by expanding into the prepared-foods segment.\n150% gains amid deafening analyst silence\nAnders Bylund (Extreme Networks): The enterprise-class networking world has gained a new giant, but analysts largely haven't noticed it yet. Through a series of smart acquisitions, old-school Ethernet-hardware specialist Extreme Networks has added modern technologies, like wireless mesh networks, fiber-optic transceivers, and virtual network-management tools in recent years.\nThe new and improved Extreme Networks has earned industry plaudits including a coveted spot in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless network products. Armed with these selling points, a larger sales division is stealing enterprise contracts from HP Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) Aruba Networks segment and from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) -- the incumbent leaders in Extreme's chosen target market.\nInvestors are already loving Extreme Networks' stronger market position, driving share prices 150% higher in 2017. Meanwhile, Cisco's stock gained a respectable 28% and HP Enterprise notched a much smaller 9% return.\nYet, Wall Street has been slow to catch on. An army of 20 analyst firms have prepared earnings estimates for HP Enterprise's next quarterly report, and Cisco notched 26 earnings forecasts. In Extreme's corner of the Street, you could hear a pin drop as only five firms gathered to provide earnings estimates.\nFurthermore, the stock has room to run even higher in 2018. Extreme Networks' shares can be bought for just 11 times forward earnings today.\nYou haven't missed the boat on Extreme Networks, and Wall Street is hardly even aware that there's a journey going on over here.\nBoring Wall Street analysts to death with steady returns\nTyler Crowe (WD-40 Company): With so many analysts filling the wings at brokerages and financial institutions, it's not that often that a company gets as little attention as WD-40. As it stands, only one analyst firm currently covers the stock and has earnings estimates. While there are likely a multitude of reasons this is the case, one significant factor is that the company's business is incredibly consistent and predictable.\nThere's almost no scenario where you can call WD-40 a growth stock. Over the past 10 years, it has only produced total revenue growth of 20%. The enticing part for investors, though, is that those revenues come with high margins and high rates of free cash flow. For every dollar of revenue, WD-40 produces about $0.10 of free cash flow.\nSince the business doesn't require high levels of capital spending to maintain current operations or expand production -- WD-40 contracts out all manufacturing for its products to third-party suppliers -- it can return that cash to shareholders with a fast-growing dividend and share repurchases. As a result, that 20% increase in revenue has translated into a 100% increase in earnings per share and a 378% total return.\nWD-40's business may not get much love from Wall Street analysts, but any serious long-term investor has to be intrigued by a company that can continue to manufacture solid returns with such modest revenue growth. With shares trading at 31 times earnings, buying WD-40's stock perhaps isn't ideal today -- but it's certainly a company you should have on your radar.\n}}

{{European and Asian stocks plummeted Wednesday after Wall Street chalked its second-biggest point decline in four years and rattled already nervous markets worldwide.\nMajor Market Indices\nThe tumble came just as international markets were recovering from sharp declines earlier this month amid concerns about overvalued stocks and a slowdown in the U.S. economy. Those worries resurfaced as troubles at U.S. sub-prime lenders and lackluster retail sales pushed the Dow Jones industrials down nearly 2 percent Tuesday, sparking sell-offs across Asia and Europe.\nEurope\u2019s main indexes widened their losses after U.S. stocks turned lower, after earlier bobbing in and out of positive territory. The U.K.\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 lost 2.6 percent to close at 6,000.70. Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 2.7 percent to 6,447.70, while France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 2.5 percent to 5,296.22.\n\u201cWeakness throughout Europe will weigh on the market,\u201d said Geoff Langham, a trader at CMC Markets in London.\nStock trading was volatile in the U.S., where the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell through the psychological 12,000 barrier for the first time since Nov. 6 amid concerns about faltering subprime mortgage lenders.\nSaxo Bank analyst Torben Krogh Nielsen warned that equities could hit a new trough by the end of the week.\n\u201cU.S. sub-prime woes are mushrooming. It\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019ll be contained and not impact the broader U.S. \u2014 and by extension, the global \u2014 economy,\u201d Krogh Nielsen said, adding that another drop of 5 percent to 10 percent in global equities was likely in the coming sessions.\nStocks in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia all fell at least 2 percent, while shares in India, Singapore and the Philippines tumbled more than 3 percent.\nOn the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Asia\u2019s biggest bourse, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 501.95 points, or 2.92 percent, to finish at 16,676.89 points. Foreign investors who bought up stocks during the market\u2019s recent recovery led the selling, traders said.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell 2.6 percent, Indian stocks dropped 3.3 percent, while Philippine stocks plunged 3.4 percent.\nThe Dow fell 242.66 points, or 1.97 percent, on Tuesday to 12,075.96 amid concerns about problems at U.S. sub-prime lenders, who provide mortgages to people with poor credit. Their difficulties raise larger concerns about the housing market and the outlook for the broader U.S. economy.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department also said sales at retailers rose a less-than-expected 0.1 percent in February, suggesting consumer spending might be waning.\n\u201cThe U.S. sub-prime concern has cast a great shadow on Asia. The worry is that it could spill over and cause the U.S. economy to slow down, and this will cause a domino effect on the world economy,\u201d said Lee Cheng Hooi, technical analysis manager at EON Capital in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThere could be more bloodbath to come.\u201d\nStill, other analysts maintained that Asia\u2019s economic fundamentals remain strong and that the recent round of declines in stock prices were more likely a correction to cool markets that had risen too far too fast over recent months.\n\u201cThe sell-off is in sympathy with the sharp sell-off we saw overnight on Wall Street, and it highlights the continued nervousness out there,\u201d said David Cohen, chief of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.\n\u201cIn perspective you could still say that this is a correction after the strong rally that was experienced for the previous several months around the world,\u201d he said.\nWhile the U.S. retail sales data and mortgage news that prompted the sell-off on Wall Street \u201care a little concerning,\u201d fundamentals such as strong U.S. jobs data released Friday were still supportive of global equities.\n\u201cThe world economy seems to be remaining on an upward trajectory,\u201d Cohen said.\nThe slump reversed a modest recovery in global markets from even bigger losses that started late last month with a 9 percent drop in Chinese stocks Feb. 27, which contributed to a 416-point drop in the Dow later that day.\n}}
{{Did you pay all of your taxes this April?\nWall Street banks typically pay much less than the official 35 percent corporate tax rate. And yet after attacking Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, President Donald Trump is pushing reforms that would make it even easier for big banks to rig the tax rules and skip out on paying their fair share.\nNine of the largest and most profitable U.S. banks paid an average federal tax rate of only 18.6 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to a new paper co-published by the Institute for Policy Studies and several tax and Wall Street reform groups.\nBy using various loopholes, these banks avoided paying about $80 billion that could\u2019ve gone towards urgent public needs, like fixing our crumbling infrastructure and expanding pre-K programs.\nUnder Trump\u2019s plan, tax-dodging banks would pay even less. The official rate would drop to 15 percent, and they\u2019d still benefit from loopholes that would let them pay even lower rates.\nOne of the biggest loopholes allows U.S. banks and other large corporations to use \u201ccreative accounting\u201d to shift profits earned in the United States to foreign nations with low or no corporate taxes. Corporations still owe U.S. taxes on these profits, but they can put off paying them indefinitely.\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could just send Uncle Sam an IOU every year?\nFinancial firms are particularly good at this offshore tax-dodging game. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) have set up more than 2,300 subsidiaries in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.\nIn 2016, they were holding nearly $150 billion in profits offshore. Trump\u2019s tax plan would slash the rate on those offshore profits to just 10 percent, saving the banks an estimated $25 billion. When these tax discounts on offshore profits have been tried in the past, they didn\u2019t help bring back U.S. jobs.\nInstead of doling out new tax breaks to Wall Street, lawmakers should be working to make sure these profitable firms pay their fair share. After all, these are the guys who drove our economy off a cliff with their recklessness and greed in 2008. After the crash, taxpayers put them on a path back to profitability with massive bailouts.\nWhere is all that money going today?\nWhile much of the country continues to struggle with widespread unemployment, losing their homes, and skinny budgets, Wall Street\u2019s high profits are once again driving sky-high pay for executives. At Citigroup, for example, a bank that wouldn\u2019t exist today if it hadn\u2019t been bailed out, CEO Michael Corbat made more than $42 million over the past three years.\nOne practical way to generate much-needed revenue from Wall Street would be through a tax on short-term speculation. Working families pay sales taxes when they buy essentials like gas and shoes. But when Wall Street traders buy millions of dollars in stocks or derivatives and sell them a split second later, they don\u2019t pay any tax at all.\nA tiny fee at rates of a few pennies per $100 of trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives would raise massive revenue while discouraging the short-term speculation that produces no real economic value and makes markets less stable.\nLawmakers should also consider using tax policy to discourage banks from taking on dangerous levels of debt. Reckless, excessive borrowing among so-called \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks was one of the key causes of the financial crisis. A small tax on big bank liabilities could raise significant money while preventing future bailouts.\nTrump\u2019s tax giveaways to Wall Street and other big corporations won\u2019t create good jobs or help Main Street businesses. As in the past, they\u2019ll just line the pockets of executives.\n}}

{{Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in February. Tim Geithner: Wall Street vengeance isn't mine In a media blitz, the Treasury secretary tries to sell a message a public eager for revenge doesn't want to hear\nWhat do we learn that we didn't already know about Timothy Geithner, after reading 15000 freshly pixellated words about him this morning? Not a whole hell of a lot, really, except that the economy must be doing a lot better than it was a year ago, because the Treasury Secretary sure seems to have plenty of time to spare these days for press interviews.\nWhich is, of course, the point. An underlying theme to both Joshua Green's epic profile in The Atlantic and John Cassidy's more restrained treatment in The New Yorker is that, due in no small part to the efforts of Geithner, the economy is in much better shape than it was a year ago. Financial markets have stabilized, Wall Street's biggest financial institutions do not appear to be on the verge of bankruptcy, and the sense of widespread panic has more or less dissipated.\nAdvertisement:\nAnd yet, neither Obama nor Geithner get much credit for this feat, from either the left or the right. The reasons are obvious: Unemployment is holding steady at near ten percent, the future prospects for economic growth are, at best, uncertain, the general public's understandable desire for vengeance against the titans of Wall Street has not been satisfied at all, and efforts at financial regulatory reform seem half-hearted and unlikely to achieve much, even if pushed through. As both profiles stress, the Obama administration, with Geithner as its economic policy point man, may have prevented further economic collapse, but did so in such a way as to \"lose the public.\" The political costs have been immense.\nBut we knew that already. Geithner's multi-magazine profile explosion is clearly calculated to reverse that impression, to rebuild his reputation. It's going to be an uphill climb. The storyline has been set. No amount of spin or media management at this point is likely to change how he is viewed, no matter how articulately the Treasury secretary jousts with smart financial reporters.\nAnd articulate he is. Both Green and Cassidy get great quotes from Geithner, who has been a model of preternatural control and calm, publicly, through his entire tenure as Treasury secretary. Here is Geithner telling Green why seeking to stabilize the financial situation was more important than getting revenge, or scoring political points.\nGeithner plainly has no patience for what he describes as the obdurate unwillingness of colleagues to subordinate their desire for superficial impact to the larger vision. \"That's exactly the dilemma,\" he said. \"The stuff that seemed appealing in terms of sharp discontinuity, Old Testament justice, clean break, fix the thing, penalize the venal, would have been dramatically damaging to the basic strategy of putting out the panic, getting growth back, making people feel more confident in the future -- solving it without putting trillions of dollars of the taxpayers' money at risk unnecessarily.\"\nOr try the closing quote to Cassidy's piece:\n\"Why do policymakers screw up financial crises?\" he said before I left his office. \"They screw up financial crises because the politics are horrible, and that deters action. They are slow and late and tentative and weak because they are scared to death of the politics. But sometimes a policymaker has to say, I'll take pain now against pain later.\"\nIn both cases, Geithner is making the case that he did what was best for the larger economy without regard to the political (or personal) cost. That he made the hard choice, not the easy one.\nThat's a questionable statement on many levels. Wouldn't the hard choice be going all in on real reform, rather than tinkering at the edges? Wouldn't the hard choice be demanding more accountability from the banks whose bacon got saved, rather than worrying endlessly about how investors, and marketers, would react to any harsh move?\nAdvertisement:\nGeithner faces an unresolvable dilemma. He's an elitist in a populist era. We heard exactly the same kind of we know what's best rhetoric on the topics of deregulation and financial sector innovation -- often delivered by men who were Geithner's mentors. There's less patience right now, on both the left and the right, for government rationalizations than I can ever remember seeing. I'm no particular fan of Old Testament justice, but my guess is that having been denied satisfaction from the current administration, the people will wreak some of their own justice at the polls in November. And the heat on Geithner will only notch up.\n}}

{{Barack Obama caused somewhat of a tizzy last week, when it was announced he would be giving a speech to some bastions of Wall Street, for a cool $400,000 speaking fee. Some were simply aghast at the idea, for a couple of different reasons. But there\u2019s one way Obama could make most of the criticism disappear (at least that portion coming from the left), and that is by making one simple promise. If Obama pledged to immediately release the transcript of his speech right after he gave it, he could defuse a lot of the angst the idea is causing among progressives. The speech reportedly won\u2019t be given until September, so Obama isn\u2019t facing an immediate deadline; but the faster he swears he\u2019ll release the text of his speech, the better for him politically.\nObama has somewhat of a mixed record with Wall Street. It didn\u2019t get a lot of media focus initially, but Obama raised record-setting amounts of funding from Wall Street during his presidential campaigns. Most voters were so swept up in the hope and change and \u201cYes, we can!\u201d that they didn\u2019t pay much attention to the mountains of cash Obama\u2019s campaign was raking in from Wall Street. Balancing that is the fact that Obama signed the Dodd/Frank bill, which was the biggest Wall Street reform package in decades. It wasn\u2019t perfect (what legislation is?), but Obama also saw the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during his presidency as well (although Elizabeth Warren rightfully gets the lion\u2019s share of this credit). Obama accepted generous donations from Wall Street while also taking big steps to reform the worst of their abuses \u2015 in other words, a mixed record at best.\nThis is one of the reasons why some people were taken aback at the idea of Obama personally cashing in from speaking to the Wall Street fatcats. It just sounded so... unseemly, somehow. In an age when Progressivism is on the rise in the Democratic Party, this appeared to be a big step back to the bad old ways of Wall Street-friendly Democratic centrism (see: Bill Clinton\u2019s D.L.C., for instance). It also reopened the wounds of the 2016 Democratic primary race, where Hillary Clinton refused to admit exactly what she\u2019d said to the Wall Street fatcats (also for large sums of money).\nThen there was criticism that (pun intended, sadly) was quite a bit darker. Some pearl-clutchers inside the Beltway were shocked \u2015 shocked! \u2015 that any politician would ever do anything so crass as to make money off their political fame. At least, that\u2019s what they said (sample Washington Post headline: \u201cIs $60 Million Really Not Enough For The Obamas?\u201d). This, however, didn\u2019t go over well with a certain segment of the population, who countered with: \u201cSo let me get this straight \u2015 the first black president is also supposed to be the first one who somehow isn\u2019t allowed to make money after leaving the White House? Is that really what you\u2019re saying?!?\u201d I\u2019ll leave these \u201cObama wants to make money \u2015 how extraordinary!\u201d criticisms alone, because I think those who are currently pushing back against them are already doing a fine job of doing so, and thus need no help from me.\nInstead, I think Obama addressing the criticisms of giving a speech to any Wall Street group (some have suggested he do a \u201cpoverty tour\u201d instead, which would be oh-so-progressive) is actually pretty easy to do. All it would take for Obama to silence his critics would be to release a statement saying something along the lines of the following:\nI will never stop speaking truth to power \u2015 that\u2019s a promise I intend to keep for the rest of my life. Some have criticized me for accepting an invitation to speak to a group of Wall Street bankers. Much like those who wanted to bar Ann Coulter from speaking to students at Berkeley, though, their thinking seems to be that each speaker must always be a perfect ideological match with the audience he or she is speaking to. I reject such thinking, because if we only preach to the choir, how is anyone going to ever change anyone else\u2019s mind? I will speak to whomever I choose, but I will not adjust or compromise my principles when doing so. To this end, I have directed the agency which handles my bookings to insert a clause in my standard speaker\u2019s contract to allow me to publicly release a transcript of my remarks, right after I give them in person. So after I give a speech to Wall Street, you\u2019ll be able to read exactly what I said to them \u2015 and that\u2019s a promise. I think what people will find is that when I prepare a speech for such a crowd, I do not tailor my message to them or water down my principles in any way. I hope this will bring an end to any controversy about my speeches.\nIn one fell swoop, Obama could silence the substantial criticisms currently being lobbed against him. The only potential drawback would be if the group decided it wasn\u2019t going to pay for a speech that would then be released to the public. But I doubt this would happen. After all, the public\u2019s interest in this speech is already very high, months in advance. If Obama were allowed to release the transcript, it would continue to be big and highly-anticipated news. Just in terms of advertising value alone, that should be well worth it for the group inviting him, I would think.\nObama making such an announcement would, of course, be a big slap in the face to Hillary Clinton. This cannot be avoided. Her insistence to never reveal what she had told Wall Street audiences cost her dearly with the Democratic voting base. She already had trust issues, and many Bernie Sanders voters just flat-out didn\u2019t believe her apparent newfound love of Populism. The secret speech transcripts just reinforced this perception, whether it was fair or not. \u201cWhat does she tell the fatcats behind closed doors, that she refuses to own up to later?\u201d everyone wondered.\nBut so be it. Obama should be allowed to set his own standards for his career as a paid speaker. And Clinton certainly can\u2019t complain too much about Obama cashing in post-presidency, since she and her husband have so successfully done so for almost two decades now. That\u2019s not a criticism directed at her or Bill per se, since they were merely following the same path every president since Ronald Reagan has lucratively followed. It is what ex-presidents do, in the modern era. The only president who remained above this money-grubbing fray that I can recall is Jimmy Carter, who decided to go build houses for the poor after his presidency. Hard to criticize that.\nBarack Obama can come out of this controversy smelling like a rose. By publicly pledging to release the transcript, he successfully counters criticism that he\u2019s secretly sucking up to Wall Street. By writing a speech full of vim and vigor which takes Wall Street to task for some of their continuing abuses, Obama would be going into the lions\u2019 den and speaking truth to power (and all the rest of the clich\u00e9s). Reading such a speech would cause progressive hearts to soar, in fact. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren might end up praising Obama for the boldness of his speech, in the end. By showing he\u2019s got nothing to hide when it comes to speaking to Wall Street, Obama could wind up increasing his already-high stature within the Democratic Party. That seems worth inserting a single clause into his standard speaking contract for any and all groups he speaks to in the future.\n}}

(CNN)-- The famously slow-moving Federal Reserve has done a rapid reversal.\nIn mere weeks, the Fed went from signaling two interest rate increases in 2019 to suggesting it could be done with rate hikes altogether. Fed chief Jerome Powell went from saying the balance sheet is on \"autopilot\" to opening the door to adjusting the policy.\nIn effect, the Fed slammed on the brakes. On Wednesday, January 30, the Federal Reserve had its January meeting, but this time didn\u2019t raise interest rates.\nThe speed and extent to which the Fed reversed itself is striking. The 180-degree turn led to immediate speculation that the central bank is surrendering to pressure from Wall Street. Recall that fears of an overly aggressive Federal Reserve helped send markets plummeting in November and December.\n\"It is difficult to read the outcome of the January FOMC meeting as anything other than the Fed capitulating to recent market volatility,\" Barclays chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.\nCharlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura, said the Fed \"utterly 'bent the knee' to the stock market.\"\n\"Equity prices now set policy I guess and not the other way,\" McElligott wrote to clients.\nNot surprisingly, Wall Street liked what it heard. The S&P 500 rallied 1.6% on Wednesday, notching its first advance on a Fed decision day since Powell took the helm.\nLocal Investment Advisor Mark Grywacheski dug into how the Fed has impacted the stock market. He joined us Monday, February 4. Your Money with Mark airs between 5 and 5:30 a.m. only on Good Morning Quad Cities.

{{Wall Street isn't exactly popping champagne bottles in the wake of Preet Bharara's exit -- enforcement isn't going away anytime soon.\nThe U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York was ousted from his post over the weekend, along with dozens of other Obama appointees. Dubbed the man \"busting Wall Street\" in 2012 by Time Magazine, Bharara made a name for himself as a securities fraud and insider trading enforcer. Following his exit, it is unlikely his office will make a major change of course, at least on financial matters.\nBharara's temporary successor is Joon Kim, deputy U.S. Attorney who returned to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in 2013 after spending seven years at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Kim is not expected to depart significantly from Bharara, a longtime colleague and friend, and is well familiarized with all of the office's major ongoing cases and investigations.\nOnlookers expect the securities fraud unit to continue at pace, regardless of who is appointed as Bharara's permanent replacement.\n\"Historically, U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York, whether Republican or Democrat, have made financial crime central to the mission of the office,\" said Arlo Devlin-Brown, partner at Covington & Burling LLP and former chief of Bharara's public corruption unit.\n\"The Southern District of New York will always be at the forefront of financial crimes investigations, so I think we will continue to see them focusing on securities fraud, insider trading, money laundering, banking violations and those sorts of things that have been the office's bread and butter for years,\" said Matthew Schwartz, partner at the law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner and a former prosecutor under Bharara.\nIn fact, there could soon be an uptick in insider trading cases, regardless of who is in charge.\nThe Supreme Court in December ruled in favor of prosecutors in an insider trading case, Salman v. United States, saying that confidential information passed on to friends or relatives counts as gifts that violate securities laws. The decision makes it easier to prosecute insider trading cases.\nIt rejected a 2014 decision in a separate case, United States v. Newman, that found prosecutors must be able to prove that the insider giving the information received some sort of financial benefit. The decision put a damper on insider trading prosecutions, because prior to it, it had been widely assumed that a non-financial benefit to the insider was sufficient.\nBharara applauded the Supreme Court's December decision in a statement. \"The Court stood up for common sense and affirmed what we have been arguing from the outset -- that the law absolutely prohibits insiders from advantaging their friends and relatives at the expense of the trading public. Today's decision is a victory for fair markets and those who believe that the system should not be rigged,\" he said.\n\"The Salman decision brings some considerable clarity to insider trading law and is likely going to result in an increase in enforcement action in that area,\" said Devlin-Brown.\nA change in party leadership generally results in a smaller shift in securities fraud priorities among the Department of Justice and U.S. attorneys in comparison to, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally speaking, cases that result in criminal charges are the result of significant fraud, where investors are being deceived or individuals are manipulating capital markets. They tend to be situations that both liberals and conservatives believe need to be addressed in order for capital markets to function properly.\nNew York Magazine reported on Sunday that Rupert Murdoch, News Corp (NWSA) CEO and former chief executive of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) , could benefit from Bharara's exit. The Southern District of New York's office is in the midst of a high-profile probe into Murdoch's Fox News looking at a number of potential crimes, including some tied to the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal.\nBoth Murdoch and Ailes are allies of Trump. Marc Mukasey, one of the attorneys rumored to be on Trump's shortlist as Bharara's successor, has ties to Ailes.\n\"I would be very surprised if the replacement for the U.S. attorney a., had anything to do with particular cases or investigations and, b., would result in decision-making that was affected by politics,\" said Schwartz.\nIn other words, Bharara or not, enforcement out of the Manhattan U.S. attorney isn't slowing down anytime soon, in Wall Street matters or otherwise.\n\"That office has been the premier financial enforcement prosecutor for decades and decades, going back to insider trading in the '80s and all sorts of other white collar prosecutions,\" said Schwartz.\n}}
{{Everyone was watching this morning\u2019s jobs data as a window into whether the Fed would cut rates and how deep such cuts might go. This numbers came in much lower than expected, leading almost everyone to conclude that a cut will come on September 18th. Goldman Sachs is now saying the most likely result is a fifty basis point cut. Some fear that even that won't be enough to hold off a possible recession. But you know all that.\nThe numbers were low enough to be scary. The first time the powers that be reported job losses since 2003. But the scariest number\u2014at least from where we sit\u2014was perhaps the zero job growth in the financial sector. Ordinarily, at least in recent years, the financial sector adds twenty thousand new jobs every month. Last month they added zero.\nIn case you aren\u2019t paying close attention, you should know that you work in the financial sector. The zero jobs number is most likely an over-estimation, given that we\u2019ve recently been going through a phase where the numbers get revised downwards. That means job losses.\nAnd from the looks of it, more are coming. If the Goldman story we led off with this morning is any indication, Wall Street firms are in a retrenchment phase, and cuts may well go deeper than has been previously reported.\n}}
{{That was quick.\nJust days after going public, Snapchat parent company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is already getting the cold shoulder from Wall Street. After jumping 44% and 11% on their first and second trading days, respectively, Snap shares are now down about 8% as the market starts to sober up from the IPO hype. That's likely because a handful of Street analysts have now picked up coverage and issued ratings, and they're not good.\nOf the seven companies that have issued ratings, five have Snap at sell, and two consider it a hold, according to CNBC.\nFirm Rating Needham Underperform Atlantic Equities Underweight Morningstar Sell Aegis Hold Susquehanna Hold Nomura Instinet Reduce Pivotal Research Sell\nMany of the larger investment banks were underwriters in the deal, and as such are subject to longer quiet periods before they can officially initiate coverage.\nWord on the Street\nThe common theme underpinning nearly all of those ratings is a belief that Snap is currently overvalued -- by a lot. There are many valuation metrics that investors can use to gauge Snap, and all of them point to a stock that is woefully overvalued. Shares are currently trading at 72 times sales, for instance.\nIf you look at market cap per daily active user (DAU), Snap was trading at around $222 per DAU based on Friday's close, according to GGV Capital managing partner Hans Tung. Compare that to Facebook, which is trading near $325 per DAU, and you see a pretty big disconnect considering the fact that Snap is much smaller, much younger, and is still figuring out monetization.\nNeedham points out that Snap's addressable market is probably 80% smaller than the dominant social network. Pivotal Research thinks the risks are simply too great considering the expectations currently being priced in, and Aegis doesn't like that DAU growth is already decelerating in a big way.\nThe negative initiations are hardly surprising, since there's broad consensus that Snap's IPO was overvalued and overhyped. Presumably, Snap will get more favorable coverage from its underwriters, despite the Chinese wall that is supposed to stand between investment banking and research divisions.\nIn terms of operating metrics, Snap resembles Twitter far more than it does Facebook, and that's not a flattering comparison. On top of that, Snap closed out its first public trading day worth about 2.5 Twitters. It's quite difficult to imagine shares having much upside at current levels, as so much is already baked into the stock price that Snap would need to execute flawlessly for years just to justify the current valuation. On the other hand, it's far easier to foresee shares a lot lower within a matter of months.\n}}
{{The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s first-quarter net income beat expectations as higher revenue from its media networks and theme parks helped offset a weaker movie slate during the quarter.\nDisney and other media companies are facing a shifting landscape as more TV watchers switch to streaming rather than traditional cable bundles. Disney is building up its streaming offerings by buying 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets for $71.3 billion and launching its own streaming services such as ESPN Plus and Disney Plus.\nCEO Bob Iger said Disney Plus and other direct-to-consumer businesses are Disney\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d\nThe entertainment company\u2019s net income fell 37 percent to $2.79 billion, or $1.86 per share. The drop was due mainly to a hefty benefit from tax changes in the prior-year quarter. Excluding one-time items, net income totaled $1.84 per share. Analysts expected net income of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet.\nThe Burbank-based company\u2019s revenue slipped less than 1 percent to $15.3 billion from $15.35 billion last year. That beat analyst expectations of $15.16 billion.\nIn a call with analysts, CEO Iger said the deal with Fox is awaiting final regulatory approval in a few remaining markets before it closes.\nDisney Plus will debut at the end of the year. No pricing has been disclosed. ESPN Plus, a $5-a-month service that offers content separate from the ESPN cable channel, continues to grow. It has 2 million paid subscribers, double what it had five months ago.\nWith the pending Fox deal, Disney will also take a controlling stake in streaming service Hulu, which is jointly owned by Disney, Fox, Comcast and AT&T. Iger said Disney could host all three streaming services, Hulu, Disney, and ESPN, on one tech platform with one username and password. Users wouldn\u2019t have to sign up for all three services, but they might get a discount if they sign up for more than one. But he added that it was premature to discuss Hulu plans until the Fox deal closes.\n}}

{{As the economic crisis continued during the first three months of 2009, many institutions in the powerful finance, insurance and real estate sector have scaled back on contributions to lawmakers, CRP has found. The individual employees within this sector and political action committees of these companies contributed some $472 million to federal candidates, committees and parties last cycle, with 51 percent going to Democrats. During the 1st Quarter of 2009, finance sector employees and PACs contributed just $12.6 million, with 58 percent going to Democrats. During the 1st Quarter of 2007, by comparison, these groups contributed $58.1 million, with 54 percent going to Democrats, and during the 1st Quarter of 2005, they contributed $22.9 million, with 57 percent going to Republicans. For some companies in this troubled sector, contributions have fallen by many hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to the first quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2007.\nBelow are two tables listing the 25 firms that showed the largest decreases in dollars contributed to federal candidates and committees, one for the change between now and the first quarter of 2005 and the second for the change between now and the first quarter of 2007.

{{NEW YORK \u2014 It is an understatement to say stock market investors had a good year in 2013. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index soared 28 percent, its best year since 1997. Including dividends, it gained 30 percent.\nWhat lies ahead after this historic year? The AP asked leading market analysts and investment managers where they see the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index winding up by the end of 2014 and why.

{{From Fred Imbert & Spriha Srivastava : The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday as investors tried to end the worst year on Wall Street since the financial crisis on a high note.\nThe 30-stock index was up 204 points, led by gains in Apple and Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 percent while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 percent. Stocks got a boost after President Donald Trump tweeted this weekend that China and the U.S. were making progress on trade talks.\nStocks were on track to log their worst annual performance since 2008, with the S&P 500 and Dow both falling more than 6 percent. In 2008, the S&P 500 and Dow plunged 38.5 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively. The Nasdaq is also down more than 4 percent for the year and on pace for its worst year in a decade, when it dropped 40 percent.\nThe S&P 500 and Dow are also on pace to fall for the first time in three years, while the Nasdaq is set to snap a six-year winning streak. For the quarter, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 14.4 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively, their worst quarterly performances since the fourth quarter of 2008. The Dow is on pace to log its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2009.\nA sizable chunk of this quarter\u2019s losses came in December. The indexes are all down at least 9 percent for the month. The Dow and S&P 500 were also on track to record their worst December performance since 1931 and their biggest monthly loss since February 2009.\nInvestors dumped stocks this month amid concerns of an economic slowdown and fears the Federal Reserve might be making a monetary policy mistake. Concern over ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U.S. have also pressured stocks this month.\nBut John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said these declines are \u201csetting the stage for upward surprises in 2019.\u201d\n\u201cWith what we believe to be almost all but the kitchen sink priced into current valuations, we see opportunity for multiples to return to levels seen at the end of the third quarter \u2026 with multiple expansions resulting in a global equity rebound in the coming year,\u201d Stoltzfus wrote in a note.\n\u201cThat said, we do not expect a rally of great significance to emerge until sometime into the first quarter of 2019. We look for market risk to weigh on investor sentiment into the new year until catalysts for a rally of some material significance appear on the scene,\u201d he added.\nMonday\u2019s gains came after Trump said he had a \u201cvery good call\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss trade. The president also claimed that \u201cbig progress\u201d was being made on this front. Trump\u2019s statements sparked gains in markets worldwide.\nDonald J.

{{Democratic House candidate gets nearly half her cash from Wall Street The numbers show that the financial services industry is funding Reshma Saujani's House campaign in New York\nReshma Saujani, the Wall Street-backed Democrat who is challenging Rep. Carolyn Maloney D-N.Y., garnered 48 percent of her second-quarter fundraising haul from people associated with the financial services industry, our analysis of her campaign filings shows.\nSaujani's donor list is an extremely rarefied place. It includes donations from ultra-elite New Yorkers like Judith Dimon ($1,400), wife of the JP Morgan CEO; ex-World Bank president James Wolfensohn ($2,400); hedge fund wizard Neil Barsky ($4,800); and Theodore Roosevelt IV of Barclays ($300). If you mapped the list, lots of donors would be clustered in the West Village, around Central Park, and on the Upper East Side.\nAdvertisement:\nSaujani's press operation has made a point of objecting every time a reporter writes about her coziness with Wall Street, even though representing the interests of the securities industry is plainly the raison d'\u00eatre of her campaign (Saujani herself is also a former banker). Last week the campaign proudly announced that a mere 25 percent of its donors for the second quarter worked in the banking industry.\nWhat the Saujani camp didn't offer was what percentage of her overall haul came from the industry. So we figured it out. The total: $189,284, or fully 48 percent of her second quarter total of $392,882.\nThat includes donations from people who actually work on the street (Goldman managing director Alexandra Mondre maxed out at $2,400), spouses of finance industry execs who listed their employment as \"homemaker\" (Jamie Dimon's wife, for example), and lawyers who primarily represent banks and hedge funds (for example, this partner in Simpson Thatcher's corporate group gave $250). Our count is probably a bit short because donors are reported to the FEC only when they give more than $200. And some donors don't list an employer or occupation.\n}}

{{The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday fired its highly regarded chief foreign affairs correspondent after evidence emerged of his involvement in prospective commercial deals \u2014 including one involving arms sales to foreign governments \u2014 with an international businessman who was one of his key sources.\nThe reporter, Jay Solomon, was offered a 10 percent stake in a fledgling company, Denx LLC, by Farhad Azima, an Iranian-born aviation magnate who has ferried weapons for the CIA. It was not clear whether Solomon ever received money or formally accepted a stake in the company.\n\"We are dismayed by the actions and poor judgment of Jay Solomon,\" Wall Street Journal spokesman Steve Severinghaus wrote in a statement to The Associated Press. \"While our own investigation continues, we have concluded that Mr. Solomon violated his ethical obligations as a reporter, as well as our standards.\"\nAzima was the subject of an AP investigative article published Tuesday. During the course of its investigation, the AP obtained emails and text messages between Azima and Solomon, as well as an operating agreement for Denx dated March 2015, which listed an apparent stake for Solomon.\nStudents Pay Tribute to New Zealand Shooting Victims With Hakas\nTwo of the students' peers were killed in the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. (Published 5 hours ago)\nAs part of its reporting, the AP had asked the Journal about the documents appearing to link Solomon and Azima. The relationship was uncovered in interviews and in internal documents that Azima's lawyer said were stolen by hackers.\n\"I clearly made mistakes in my reporting and entered into a world I didn't understand.\" Solomon told the AP on Wednesday. \"I never entered into any business with Farhad Azima, nor did I ever intend to. But I understand why the emails and the conversations I had with Mr. Azima may look like I was involved in some seriously troubling activities. I apologize to my bosses and colleagues at the Journal, who were nothing but great to me.\"\nTwo other Denx partners \u2014 ex-CIA employees Gary Bernsten and Scott Modell \u2014 told the AP that Solomon was involved in discussing proposed deals with Azima at the same time he continued to cultivate the businessman as a source for his stories for the Journal. Bernsten and Modell said Solomon withdrew from the venture shortly after business efforts began and that the venture never added up to much. They provided no evidence as to when Solomon withdrew.\nThe emails and texts reviewed by the AP \u2014 tens of thousands of pages covering more than eight years \u2014 included more than 18 months of communications involving the apparent business effort. Some messages described a need for Solomon's Social Security number to file the company's taxes, but there was no evidence Solomon provided it.\nDenx was shuttered last year, according to Florida business registration records.\nIn an April 2015 email, Azima wrote to Solomon about a proposal for a $725 million air-operations, surveillance and reconnaissance support contract with the United Arab Emirates that would allow planes to spy on activity inside nearby Iran. Solomon was supposed to ferry the proposal to UAE government representatives at a lunch the following day, the email said.\n\"We all wish best of luck to Jay on his first defense sale,\" Azima wrote to Solomon, Bernsten and Modell.\nUnder the proposed UAE deal, Azima's firms were to manage specially equipped surveillance planes to monitor activity in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\nIn October 2014, Solomon wrote to Azima in a text message: \"Our business opportunities are so promising.\"\nIn another message that same month, Solomon asked Azima whether he had told a mutual friend about their business plans.\n\"Hell no!\" Azima replied.\nThe emails show Solomon's relationship with Azima began professionally, as the reporter cultivated the businessman as a source of information about Iranian money in a Georgian hotel deal and other matters. A review of Solomon's published work over the past four years indicated Azima never appeared by name in the newspaper.\n3 Dead in Dutch Tram Shooting; Attacker at Large\nAt least three people were killed and nine others injured in a shooting that broke out on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht. (Published Monday, March 18, 2019)\nThe hacked materials also demonstrate that Azima cultivated close relationships with fellow Western and American journalists, including those at the AP, and frequently communicated with them by phone, text and email. None appeared to involve the same level of personal involvement or referenced potential business deals.\nOver decades, Azima has glided among different worlds, flying weapons to the Balkans, selling spy gear to Persian Gulf nations, dealing with a small Midwest bank and navigating Washington's power circles. In an April 2016 memo, a public relations firm he worked with, Prime Strategies, suggested Solomon could be called upon to \"write a feature story about Farhad\" to help combat negative coverage.\nIn May 2015, Bernsten \u2014 using an email under the alias \"The Vicar\" \u2014 told Azima of a plan to help a dissident member of the Kuwaiti royal family instigate public protests over corruption with the goal of bringing down the nation's government. Though the Kuwaiti plan involved Denx, Solomon was not included in the emails and said he knew nothing about it. It does not appear the plans were ever executed, as 87-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah remains in power.\nCopyright Associated Press\n}}
{{Last semester, NYU undergraduate Sara Ackerman was given an assignment by to visit Occupy Wall Street and turn in an ethnography of what was going on down in Zuccotti Park. This did not sit right with Sara. Mingle with \"criminals, drug addicts, mentally ill people, rapist, and paranoid schizophrenics\"? The fuck she would, and Ackerman told her professor, Caitlin Zaloom, as much, expressing serious \"discomfort with the assignment for legal, academic, ethical, moral, and safety reasons\" and asking for \"an alternative via her private office hours, in-class requests and emails to her NYU email account.\" When Zaloom denied the request, Ackerman had no choice but to head down to OWS, not just because it was required for the class, but to prove a point. She went, she says, with \"two other young girls, who are quite attractive and don't look particularly fit enough to take on a potential predator, rapist, paranoid schizophrenic, etc, just to see if I was being as melodramtic as Professor Zaloom made me feel I was.\" She wasn't.\nIn fact, she left the park \"feeling as though I had escaped an extremely dangerous-- and even, life-threatening, situation.\" Ackerman never ended up turning in the assignment, she was, she claims, treated poorly by a graduate assistant and Professor Zaloom for the rest of the semester and earlier this week, she decided people needed to be held accountable.\nOn Wednesday, she waited at the library in \"a last-ditch effort to convince [NYU President John Sexton] to deal with Professor Zaloom via forcing her to resign, or firing her\" and instead of coming to meet her, Sexton had mental health services deal with Sara, via a forced psych evaluation. Wrong move, NYU. Like Ackerman \"told Sergeant Weitzman-- the NYU officer who filled out [her] report-- if NYU tried to pull the mental health card again, [she] would go very public.\" Nobody calls Sara Ackerman crazy, ya hear?

{{In the aftermath of last week\u2019s New York primary and the run-up to key primaries this week in Northeastern states, a chorus of Democratic figures has demanded that Bernie Sanders, the self-styled \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d challenging Hillary Clinton for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, mute criticism of the frontrunner\u2019s ties to Wall Street, as a first step to conceding the nomination.\nThe attacks are focused on Sanders\u2019 demand that Clinton make public the transcripts of speeches she gave to major financial firms in exchange for millions of dollars in fees. Clinton has flatly refused to release the transcripts, which would expose her flattery of financial parasites whose reckless and criminal activities crashed the US and world economy and caused untold social devastation.\nThe Democratic Party establishment and its backers on Wall Street and in the media are preparing to anoint a candidate who is already widely hated and seen by a majority of voters as dishonest and corrupt\u2013a reputation well earned by Clinton and her ex-president husband. Some 56 percent of voters have negative feelings toward Clinton, and only a third regard her as \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d\nAt the same time, the Clinton campaign, which to this point in the primary contest has talked \u201cleft\u201d in an attempt to ward off the challenge from Sanders, is preparing to shift sharply to the right in preparation for the November general election. It feels somewhat constrained, however, by the continued presence of Sanders.\nHence the escalating pressure on Sanders to halt his attacks on Clinton\u2019s Wall Street links and prepare a rapid exit. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada last week attacked Sanders for carrying out a \u201cnegative campaign,\u201d while Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, called on Sanders to help \u201cunify our party and stand behind Hillary Clinton.\u201d Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia called Sanders\u2019 demands that Clinton publish her speeches to Wall Street firms \u201cover the top,\u201d and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey scolded him for attacking \u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s honesty and integrity.\u201d\nThe New York Times, which has been slanting its news coverage to favor Clinton and using its op-ed pages to publish smears of Sanders by \u201cliberal\u201d columnists such as Paul Krugman and Charles M. Blow, has taken up the campaign for Sanders to rein in his attacks on Clinton and forcefully urge his supporters to back her in November. Sanders, for his part, is a long-time ally of the party establishment and has repeatedly said he will support the eventual Democratic nominee.\nThe campaign by the party leadership has had its effect. Though Sanders trails Clinton by fewer than 300 pledged delegates and remains neck-and-neck in national polls\u2014as well as in California, whose June 7 primary awards 475 delegates\u2014his campaign has sent signals that it will limit criticism of Clinton and may tacitly concede the nomination, even as Sanders pledges to formally stay in the race until the Philadelphia convention in July.\nOn Saturday, Sanders\u2019 chief campaign adviser Tad Devine told National Public Radio that the campaign could \u201creevaluate\u201d its criticisms of Clinton\u2019s relations with the financial industry after this Tuesday\u2019s primaries, and on the Sunday morning television program \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sanders admitted that he had \u201ca narrow path\u201d to the nomination and pledged that he would support Clinton against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\nIf Hillary Clinton secures the nomination, she would be, after Trump, the least popular presidential nominee in history. The overwhelming majority of voters who do not like Clinton, moreover, \u201care united in what they dislike,\u201d according to a poll published in mid-April. \u201c[V]oters with an unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton volunteer they think she\u2019s dishonest or corrupt,\u201d the poll reported.\nThis is for good reason. Sanders\u2019 mild criticisms of Clinton minimize the reality of a political duo that is fully wedded to America\u2019s financial aristocracy and has been since Bill and Hillary\u2019s close ties to the Walton family (Walmart) and other corporate interests during their years in Arkansas.\nAccording to a CNN analysis carried out in February, from 2001 until the current election cycle, Hillary and former president Bill Clinton were paid a combined $153 million for 729 speeches, delivered mainly to powerful corporate firms and lobbies. Among these were 39 speeches to the major Wall Street finance houses Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Citigroup, for which the Clintons were paid a combined $7.7 million.\nThese are the very banks whose recklessness and greed precipitated the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, and were then saved by the intervention of the Bush and Obama administrations, which made available to Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds with no strings attached. Hillary Clinton, then a senator from New York, repaid her Wall Street sponsors by voting in favor of the $700 billion bank bailout bill.\nThe couple delivered another 25 speeches to these firms in the years after the financial collapse.\n\u201cAs Sanders fades, it becomes less critical\u201d to worry over Clinton\u2019s speeches to the major banks, an anonymous source described as \u201cone longtime Clinton ally and confidante\u201d told The Hill .\nThe Democrats, with the assistance of Sanders, are preparing to drop the issue of Wall Street criminality and social inequality in advance of the general election. The even more urgent issue of war has from the outset been virtually excluded from the 2016 election campaign by both parties and all of the candidates, including Sanders, who has made clear his support for Obama\u2019s wars in the Middle East and his military provocations against Russia and China.\nIn the wake of her New York primary victory, the Clinton campaign has moved to openly promote the former secretary of state\u2019s war credentials. This was signaled by a lengthy article published in the New York Times Sunday Magazine headlined, \u201cHow Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk,\u201d by White House correspondent Mark Landler. The article reports favorably that the Democratic frontrunner was the most militaristic figure in the Obama administration and asserts that she is now \u201cthe true hawk left in the race\u201d for president.\nUnderscoring the right-wing character of her campaign, far-right billionaire Charles Koch, a major funder of the Tea Party, said he would not rule out supporting Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, whether it be Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Koch told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week on Sunday.\u201d He added, \u201cWe would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric, let me put it that way.\u201d Koch also favorably compared the presidency of Bill Clinton, which ended the federal welfare program and lifted virtually all regulations on the banks and hedge funds, with that of George W. Bush.\nThis will not prevent Sanders from carrying out his assigned task of channeling the anger and hostility to capitalism of young and working class voters back behind the Democratic Party.\n}}
{{These three books take quite different approaches to one of Asia's biggest mysteries: Japan's economic collapse. Van Rixtel, a senior economist at the European Central Bank, casts his analysis in the context of broad political economy theories, with special attention to monetary practices. He starts with a thoughtful and systematic review of the scholarly literature on what is distinctive about Japan's political economy and in the process summarizes the positions of most leading thinkers on the subject. On the critical issue of the late 1990s banking crisis, Van Rixtel singles out policy mistakes according to standard economic theory, which were then compounded by questionable Japanese practices, such as the lack of transparency and weak regulatory discipline. These he associates with the Japanese practice of amakudari, literally, \"descent from heaven\}}

{{The hottest initial public offering this year wasn\u2019t a Silicon Valley tech firm, or a Chinese shale oil play, or a biotechnology start-up out of India. No. It was a low-end pasta joint based in Denver that went public on Friday.\nReally?\nReally.\nNoodles & Co. staged its IPO on a sleepy, muggy, low-volume trading day. But the shares, initially priced at $18 per share, went banoodles when trading started. They opened at about $35 and closed at $36.75, up 104 percent. After digesting the news over the weekend, traders pushed shares up further on Monday; it closed at $38.47. This was the sort of IPO that Facebook expected (but didn\u2019t produce) last year. And in 2013, you\u2019d think that only a paradigm-changing, social-search, cloud-based gaming app would be able to take the market by storm.\nIf you were a Wall Street banker, you wouldn\u2019t think that a place that bills itself as \u201cYour World Kitchen,\u201d where most dishes cost about $8, and that has an outpost in Manhattan, Kansas (but none in the real Manhattan), would be a smashing success. And indeed, the company\u2019s origins, combined with Wall Street\u2019s geographic and food snobbery, led the underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and UBS, to misjudge Noodles & Co.\u2019s value.\nIn theory, underwriters test the waters. Before an offering, they go around and talk to investors, and gauge how much they\u2019d be willing to pay, based on their assessment of the quality of the company and the sexiness of its story. The idea is to price the shares at a level where first-day buyers see a nice 5 or 10 percent pop. That\u2019s their reward for jumping in early and establishing a market for the shares. But if the shares double at the opening trade, the underwriters screwed up. They helped the company sell shares to the public at $18 a piece when it turns out the public was more than willing to pay $36. Noodles & Co. raised nearly $97 million by selling 5.357 million shares to the public at $18 each; they could have raised nearly $200 million by selling a stake of the same size.\nPlainly, Wall Street blew it. The shares soared not because there is some bubble raging in restaurant stocks, or because noodles are a hot new concept. Rather, they soared because traders outside the bubble of Wall Street and the institutional investors they deal with had a different view of Noodles & Co. And when you take a step back, it seems as if Noodles & Co. was actually set up to punk Wall Street.\nNeither Noodles nor Morgan Stanley wanted to comment on the offering. On Friday, Noodles CEO Keith Reddy told Bloomberg: \u201cWe\u2019ve been delivering some of the best results in the restaurant industry in the last five years, and the market understands that and respects that.\u201d\nYet, like the rest of us coastal dwellers, Wall Streeters are food snobs. We know that hot food trends come from New York, and Brooklyn, and from Southern and Northern California, and from Spain and Asia. Not from the heartland.\nNoodles & Co. was founded in 1995. It is based in Denver (which most East Coasters know as the place you have to fly to before you switch planes for Aspen or Vail), and really has no presence on the coasts. Like the U.S. economy as a whole in the post-recession years, it has grown from the inside out. Go to the store locator on the company\u2019s website, and you\u2019ll quickly discover that Noodles & Co. is big in the Plains and in Big Ten country. There are 50 in Colorado, 9 in Iowa, 33 in Minnesota, 15 in Michigan, 36(!) in Wisconsin. There are only 7 in California.\nOrdinarily I\u2019d be happy to try a casual dining chain for a reporting assignment. But there are none within striking range. In Connecticut, there\u2019s one lonely outlet\u2014in West Hartford, not in Fairfield County. There\u2019s one in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and none in New York. (One is coming soon to the Westbury Plaza in Garden City on Long Island.) In other words, there are as many Noodles & Co.'s in North Dakota as there are in the heavily populated tristate area. The coming-soon list is heavy on college towns: Ann Arbor, Michigan; Lincoln, Nebraska; in Richmond near Virginia Commonwealth University. An email sent to Daily Beast colleagues on both coasts in search of anyone who had ever eaten in one was met with deafening silence. I\u2019m guessing an internal e-mail sent by the Wall Street underwriting team would have produced a similar result. Very few Wall Streeters have a personal experience with the chain.\nReading between the lines of the menu and the offering, it\u2019s easy to conclude that Noodles & Co. dishes up mid-priced, middlebrow food for mid-America. And in an age of ever-increasing authenticity and greater detail\u2014there\u2019s now a Cambodian sandwich joint in New York\u2019s Chelsea Market, and taco truck connoisseurs debate the merits of the different regions from which the vendors hail\u2014Noodles & Co. offers a sort of everywhere-and-nowhere combination. The menu has Pad Thai, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Wisconsin Macaroni & Cheese, Steak Stroganoff, and Indonesian Peanut Sauce. The offerings aren\u2019t exactly low cal\u2014 large portions pack up to 700 and 800 calories. And for those who find all those noodle and vegetable dishes too exotic, there\u2019s comfort fare like a Wisconsin Cheese Steak and a BBQ Pork Sandwich.\nFood snobs cotton to restaurants that challenge their sensibilities, with molecular gastronomy, exotic ingredients, and tyrannical chefs who demand you eat whatever they put on your plate. By contrast, Noodles & Co. exudes a sort of Midwestern nice sensibility. \u201cWe have purposefully chosen a range of healthy-to-indulgent dishes to satisfy carnivores and vegetarians,\u201d its prospectus notes. \u201cWe believe our variety ensures that even the pickiest of eaters can find something to crave, which eliminates the \"veto vote\" and encourages people with different tastes to enjoy a meal together.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s the thing. While Wall Streeters might not want to have a closing dinner at Noodles & Co., it does possess many of the attributes investors look for in a solid investment. There\u2019s veteran management: Chief Executive Officer Kevin Reddy, who has run the company since April 2006, is a former chief operating officer of Chipotle, another Colorado-based fast-casual chain that exploded. Unlike social media companies, Noodles & Co. has a profitable, simple business model\u2014it sells dishes for more than it costs to buy the ingredients, labor, and overhead. (It owns most of the restaurants but also franchises some.) And it has shown impressive growth.\nAs of April 30, there were 339 Noodles & Co. restaurants, 288 owned by the company and 51 owned by franchisees, in 25 states and D.C. Between 2008 and 2012, years in which topline growth was hard to come by for consumer-facing companies, Noodles & Co. saw revenue practically double, from $170 million to $300 million, while operating income rose eight-fold, from $2 million to $16 million. In 2012, it opened 45 new outlets and it expects that 50 new Noodles & Co. restaurants will open this year. And the restaurants that are open are reporting healthy same-store growth: 4.8 percent in 2011, and 5.4 percent in 2012.\nNoodles & Co. provides a great example of a company that has prospered in the recession and in the slow-growth aftermath by providing solid value, focusing on operations, and offering greater choice in areas that have traditionally been food deserts. There are no small plates or beggar\u2019s purses filled with sea-urchin foam here. Just noodles.\nAnd ultimately that may be what really confounded the Wall Street bankers. Noodles & Co.\u2019s menu is almost entirely based on carbohydrates. And everybody knows that Masters of the Universe won\u2019t go near a bowl of carb-laden pasta\u2014 unless they\u2019re loading up for a triathlon.\n}}
{{As buzz grows and poll numbers rise for Occupy Wall Street, the now-global movement that launched in New York City on Sept. 17 may yet become the unexpected, outside player that forces the 2012 election field to adjust its course.\nA new AP-GfK poll shows that 37 percent of the American public supports OWS, while research firm Chitika shows that online interest in the movement has swelled 150 percent over the past month.\n\u201cThis will have major implications on the upcoming elections,\u201d says Gabriel Donnini, analyst at the Westborough, Mass.-based online analytics firm, Chitika. \u201cThe movement is not dying out or going quietly and candidates will need to address the concerns and demands voiced by those on the streets and making a buzz on the Internet,\u201d he adds.\nWhile it\u2019s too early to predict the impact Occupy Wall Street will have on local elections, presidential candidates have begun to recalibrate their responses, say political observers.\nGOP hopeful Mitt Romney, for instance, has already shifted from using class warfare rhetoric, says Sarah Sobieraj, assistant professor of sociology at Tufts University in Massachusetts and author of \"Sound-bitten: The Perils of Media-Centered Political Activism.\"\n[ Video is no longer available. ]\n\u201cRomney has said things like, \u2018I worry about the 99 percent in America',\" Ms. Sobieraj says, \"which is a pretty clear reference to the Occupy movement.\u201d\nIf the movement sustains itself at its current level, she adds, \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard for politicians to avoid.\u201d\nPresident Obama has already embraced the movement, validating frustrations about jobs and the state of the economy, says Sobieraj.\nSome congressional candidates have adopted the language of the movement too. Elizabeth Warren \u201csounds like one of the protestors,\u201d says Sobieraj, noting the Massachusetts Democratic Senate candidate's comments about the lack of accountability in financial institutions.\nAs the Occupy movement gains strength, politicians will have to strategize carefully, notes Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Kiron Skinner, co-author of \u201cThe Strategy of Campaigning: Lessons from Ronald Reagan and Boris Yeltsin.\u201d\nThe role of the growing Occupy movement is important for politicians because it is providing a clear policy alternative to the ground staked out by the tea party position, Ms. Skinner says. The challenge \u201cwill entail reconciling two very clear and different positions about the role of government in the economy.\u201d\nAnd the politician that can reconcile these two very different positions will most likely be stronger than his or her competitor, she says.\nAt this stage in the 2010 midterm elections, many analysts questioned whether the tea party would have a significant impact, says Robin Lauermann, professor of politics at Messiah College in Grantham, Pa.\n\u201cThey had a greater impact than some expected, though they have not coalesced enough to be the sole dominating influence for the 2012 GOP race,\" Ms. Lauermann. Though, she adds, \"Much can happen in a year.\"\n\"As the Occupy movement endures and maintains its peaceable approach, it certainly has the potential to grow as a counterpoint in the upcoming elections,\" especially Lauermann says, if Obama can transform their dissatisfaction into votes.\n}}
{{Maneet Ahuja.\nPeering out from under a set of false eyelashes at a pink-encased BlackBerry, Maneet Ahuja, a 27-year-old CNBC producer and hedge fund specialist, looked every bit the harried Manhattan media underling as she sat down at Ground Support in Soho last week.\nAhuja was smiling but deflated. She had just learned that despite a monthlong media push and a star-studded book party whose guest list included such Wall Street notables as David Tepper, Leon Cooperman, and John Paulson, her new book, The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World\u2019s Top Hedge Funds, had missed the week\u2019s New York Times best-seller list.\nThe Alpha Masters is an examination of the world\u2019s leading hedge fund managers, as well as a book-length shrine to their investing prowess. Ahuja, whose nickname and Twitter handle is \u201cWall Street Maneet,\u201d spent three years sketching nine mini-biographies of the industry\u2019s biggest, most reticent names. The resulting book, which features a flattering foreword from PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian and an afterword from Nobel laureate Myron Scholes, has raised Ahuja\u2019s profile, but has also drawn accusations that she is a cheerleader for the .01 percent.\nBoaz Weinstein, the Saba Capital trader who harpooned the London Whale, is described as a man of \u201cintelligence, discipline, pluck, enthusiasm for his work, and a distinct ability to stay calm even under the most trying of circumstances.\u201d Ahuja christens Appaloosa Management boss David Tepper a \u201cfearless first mover,\u201d praises activist investor William Ackman\u2019s \u201ccharming and benevolent\u201d personality, and notes that Third Point founder Daniel Loeb has an \u201cactive physical lifestyle that would put many men half his age to shame.\u201d\nI\u2019d asked Ahuja to coffee after hearing a steady trickle of unflattering gossip about The Alpha Masters. It was a \u201clove letter to her sources,\u201d one hedge fund worker told me. A \u201ccomplete puff piece,\u201d a PR executive said. Among financial journalists, rumors flew that Ahuja had given her book\u2019s subjects the chance to sign off on, or even ghostwrite, their own chapters.\nAhuja denied having had writing help, although she said that her hedge fund honchos (and their lawyers) were allowed to review their chapters before they went to press.\n\u201cThere was no book if that wasn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d she said.\nSome of the grumbling from fellow journalists can be chalked up to professional jealousy. At 27, Ahuja is further along in her career than many of her peers. She started her career at 17 as a Citigroup intern, then moved to The Wall Street Journal, where she was a graphics reporting assistant, before landing at CNBC in February 2008.\nSince then, say people who know her, Ahuja has amassed a golden Rolodex, in part by being protective of her hedge fund sources and dogged in her quest to corral them into guest chairs on Squawk Box, the network\u2019s flagship morning show. Her ability to massage the egos of the ultrawealthy surely doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cI was just kind of in awe,\u201d she said of her decision to write the book. \u201cI was grateful that I was getting to experience and shape these news stories that were out there in a real way.\u201d\nAhuja defended her enthusiasm \u2014 \u201cyou can\u2019t deny there are some trades in the hedge fund industry that have been pure genius\u201d \u2014 and dismissed allegations that she took it easy on her sources.\n\u201cI had no need to create a puff piece,\u201d she told me. \u201cBelieve me, I have reported tough stories, and I will continue to do so. I have managers who have threatened to kill me!\u201d (At this, her publicist recoils, and suggests she not go into details.)\nAmong the revelations Ahuja included in the book against her subjects\u2019 wishes, she said, were their hedge funds\u2019 performance numbers, and a mildly controversial, decades-old anecdote from David Tepper, who told her that Goldman Sachs, his former employer, once asked him to make legally questionable trades. But Ahuja admits that she paid more attention to her subjects\u2019 victories \u2014 letting Kynikos Associates\u2019 James Chanos recount how he discovered Enron\u2019s accounting fraud, for example, or giving space to a retelling of John Paulson\u2019s famous housing short, which made him billions of dollars during the financial crisis. (Some ink is also given to Paulson\u2019s 2011 annus horribilis, when he lost some 52 percent in his Advantage Plus fund.)\nThe book comes at a time when hedge fund managers are very much in the news, and positive PR is hard to find. Politicians have made their capital gains tax rates a campaign issue, while industry observers have been zeroing in on whether they actually make money. Last weekend, the New York Times wrote about the South Carolina pension fund\u2019s disappointing rendezvous with the go-go world of hedge funds and private equity firms. The Wall Street Journal carried a story, based on a Citigroup survey, that said that the amount of money managed by hedge funds could triple to $5 trillion in the next five years, even as the industry\u2019s returns generally lag behind other kinds of investments.\nAll of this is fertile ground for a hedge fund reporter who, like Ahuja, has the ear of the Paulsons and Dalios of the world. What chafes her critics is that Ahuja has used her access to sing her subjects\u2019 praises instead of probing the industry\u2019s dark corners.\nOver the course of our coffee, Ahuja grew frustrated with her critics\u2019 suggestion that having access to the upper echelons of the hedge fund world has hampered her ability to be critical of her subjects. The reason she has become CNBC\u2019s go-to hedge fund wrangler, she said, is because she has \u201cno axe to grind,\u201d and because she can get important people to pick up the phone when news breaks.\n\u201cThey come to me because I can get the fastest response,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that C-suite access is a kind of fiat currency, and having relationships with the titans of the hedge fund world can make or break a journalist\u2019s career. The Alpha Masters epitomizes the kind of business reporting where success is dependent on proximity, and the default mode is collaboration rather than interrogation.\nAnd while that kind of journalism may not make for gritty reading, it has given Wall Street Maneet all the eyes she needs.\n}}

{{Companies have found a new way to surprise analysts: They're selling more stuff.\nMajor Market Indices\nThree out of four companies in the S&P index that have reported earnings this quarter have beat sales predictions by Wall Street analysts. And some companies aren't just merely squeaking in ahead of expectations. Fifteen percent of companies that beat estimates did so by at least 10 percent, according to Standard & Poor's.\nMore companies are beating sales predictions than at any other point since the recession ended in June 2009. This surprise comes on top of eight straight quarters of beating analysts' profit forecasts.\nAnalysts often underestimate profits when companies cut costs in ways that aren't easy to gauge from the outside. But those same experts rarely make mistakes with revenue projections. That's because many analysts have developed highly-reliable, fine-tuned systems to estimate sales, ranging from counting cars in a parking lot to complex mathematical models.\nWhy were so many experts wrong?\nAnalysts were far too worried that high gas prices, uprisings in the Middle East and Libya and fallout from the earthquake in Japan would result in lower business and consumer spending. Instead, consumers are spending more on everything from airfare to oranges.\nPositive sales surprises indicate that consumers and businesses are absorbing things like higher food and gas prices \u2014 and still spending on non-necessities. So far this quarter, two out of every three companies that chase consumers' discretionary spending on things like dresses, motorcycles and even trips to Las Vegas brought in more revenue than investors expected. All told, higher sales could signal a healthier economic recovery than investors believed.\n\"It appears that all of the caution was unfounded,\" said Jonathan Golub, the chief U.S. strategist at UBS.\nThe revenue surprises are one reason why the S&P index has risen 2.8 percent to 1,363.61 so far in the second quarter and 8.4 percent for the year to date. The S&P index has risen by an average of 9.6 percent per year over the last 25 years, according to FactSet. A gain of 8 percent in just four months means that the S&P could top last year's 12.8 percent gain if it continues to rise.\nMany of the revenue surprises came among industrial, materials, and technology companies that produce everything from bulldozers to cellphones. These three groups typically do well in an economic expansion as businesses ramp up production \u2014 another sign of a healthier recovery. Eighteen of the 21 industrial companies in the S&P 500 that have released earnings beat sales estimates by nearly 5 percent, according to UBS.\nSome companies, like Apple Inc., would have bested sales estimates by even more if it weren't for production delays. The company brought in $1.3 billion more in sales than the $23.4 billion analysts were expecting after record sales of its new line of iPads. \"We sold every iPad 2 that we could make,\" Peter Oppenheimer, the company's chief financial officer, said during the company's earnings call.\nOther companies said that higher revenues are leading them to expand. On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc. said that it generated $300 million more in sales than the $9.5 billion analysts predicted. The company missed profit expectations because it is spending money on warehouses and upgrading its technology. \"\"We're just seeing tremendous growth, and because of that we're having to invest in a lot of capacity,\" said Thomas Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer told analysts.\nWhether or not those gains will last remains to be seen. So far, new payroll tax breaks could be masking the pain at gas and food checkouts for consumers. The one-year 2 percentage-points break means an average of $695 more in take-home pay for some 159 million workers.\nBut more price increases are coming. Household products giant Procter & Gamble said Thursday that it plans to raise prices this summer on items like Head & Shoulders shampoo, Iams pet food and Cascade dishwashing detergent. McDonald's Corp., too, is raising prices because of higher food costs. These increases follow others that came in the second half of 2010, the first post-recession rise in prices.\nCompanies hope that consumers remain confident enough in the economy to absorb these increases and still spend on non-necessities. If they don't, that could make these sales surprises \u2014 which have led to profit margins near some of the highest levels in two decades \u2014 are a short-term phenomenon.\n}}
{{The New York Times is going after the financial industry with a vengeance. First came a Times news video headlined \"Wall Street Regains Its Swagger.\" It featured Susanne Craig intoning, \"Most of America is still digging out from the credit crisis triggered by Wall Street, which made billions of dollars of risky investments. Many of those trades were real estate-related, and they've since gone sour. As a result, thousands of Americans have lost their homes, and the unemployment rate is currently hovering around 10%.\"\nThis is so lacking in nuance or even in basic accuracy as to be silly. I'm not saying that \"Wall Street\" doesn't bear some of the blame for foreclosures or the high unemployment rate, but there are plenty of other institutions and individuals worth mentioning, from the politicians and government officials in Washington pushing homeownership, to the Federal Reserve that kept mortgage rates low for a long time, to the real estate brokers and mortgage brokers and originators who pushed the homes out there, to the individuals who bought more expensive homes than they should have, to the politicians and government officials who panicked and started seizing private companies, to the politicians who are delaying the recovery by extending unemployment benefits and threatening tax increases...one could go on and on.\nThen, Saturday's New York Times op-ed page carried not one but two banker-bashing specials.\nA Bob Herbert column asserted, \"Recessions are for the little people, not for the corporate chiefs and the titans of Wall Street who are at the heart of the American aristocracy. They have waged economic warfare against everybody else and are winning big time....The corporate fat cats are becoming alarmingly rotund.\"\nMr. Herbert writes, \"Societal conflicts metastasize as resentments fester and scapegoats are sought....You can almost feel the bitterness rising.\"\nMr. Herbert is writing about himself. He's the bitter-sounding one scapegoating \"corporate fat cats.\" Again, it's not even accurate; Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein's 2008 compensation dropped 98.4% from the year before, and Citigroup's Vikram Pandit earned $1 a year in both 2010 and 2011, hardly recession-proof. Aristocracy?

{{Small, mid-sized and large U.S. banks are likely to benefit from a Treasury Department report released late Monday proposing a variety of changes to tough financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis, including a measure that would significantly ease so-called annual stress tests banks must undergo to see if they could survive a hypothetical economic meltdown.\nThe report, written in response to a Trump Administration executive order in February, is 149 pages long, and includes dozens of recommendations to cut back on restrictions imposed by the Obama Administration's post-crisis Dodd-Frank Act.\nNevertheless, the recommended changes, which were issued under the oversight of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are less sweeping than legislation approved last week by a divided House of Representatives. The House OK'd legislation seeking to eliminate key sections of Dodd-Frank in a vote that did not get the backing of a single Democratic lawmaker.\nSome of the report's recommended alternations stand to buoy lenders from Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , Citigroup Inc. (C) , Morgan Stanley, (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS. Others will likely be viewed positively by regional banks such as Zions Bancorporation (ZION) and Comerica Inc. (CMA) as well as smaller community banks.\nThe narrower scope of the legislative recommendations also suggests that any bill based on the report would have a greater chance of being approved. Any legislation that reaches the White House would need the support of some moderate Democrat senators, since Republicans have only a 52-seat majority and 60 votes are needed to prevent a filibuster. As a result, the package will be carefully reviewed by the Senate Banking Committee and its chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who is expected to release his own legislation to restructure the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Treasury report highlights many areas that require further study and recommends that banks with less than $10 billion in assets be exempted from the Volcker Rule, a measure mostly focused on the largest U.S. banks that was designed to keep institutions from speculative trading on their own accounts. Also recommended is a provision that could exempt bigger banks for the Volcker Rule if they don't trade a lot, however little detail is provided as to how regulators would oversee such a change. Nevertheless, the recommendation is vastly different than what the House bill proposes -- a complete elimination of the Volcker Rule and many other standards in exchange for a higher capital buffer at big banks.\nThe package also seeks to provide relief for small, mid-sized and possibly even larger banks when it comes to annual stress tests they must undergo to identify if they could survive a financial crisis similar to the 2008 credit crunch. The report recommends easing restrictions so that banks with less than $50 billion in assets would be exempt from conducting one set of tests. Currently banks with greater than $10 billion in assets must participate.\nThe report also suggests that even the biggest banks could be excused if they can make their business models simpler. It also seeks to adjust stress tests for the biggest banks to a two-year cycle instead of the current annual approach. Finally, it even suggests that these tests, a signature part of the Obama Administration's financial crisis response, could be eliminated if banks hold higher capital buffers.\nThe Treasury report also took issue with the threshold at which banks are deemed Systemically Important Financial Institutions, and thus subjected to stricter oversight and capital requirements, suggesting that some mid-size banks with more than $50 billion in assets could be exempted. The report said that tough restrictions have created barriers for regional and mid-sized banks at the same time that they are \"contributing to the solidification of the market position of the largest\" banks.\nThis recommendation, which could gain the support of some moderate Democrats, should give mid-size regional bank stocks, including Zions and Comerica, a boost in trading Tuesday since their institutions stand to gain the most from becoming exempt for the regulatory oversight.\nIn addition, the findings come just a few days ahead of a Thursday, June 15, Senate Banking Committee hearing that will focus on the SIFI threshold and other regulatory issues affecting regional banks. Zions CEO Harris Simmons and Randy Chesler, CEO of Glacier Bancorp (GBCI) , are both scheduled to testify and are likely to say that the SIFI threshold has hurt companies like theirs more than so-called global banks. At the hearing, Crapo -- the committee chairman -- may provide some guidance about his own legislative proposals.\nAdditionally, the report's recommendations seek to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief removable at will by the president or, alternatively, have Congress restructure the one-person led agency so that it is made up of a five-member bipartisan panel. It also wants the CBPB, which was set up to write rules for mortgage and credit products, to get its funding from the appropriations committee, rather than the current way it is automatically funded from the Federal Reserve. Either approach could restrict the agency's oversight role. Such a move would be cheered on by opponents who say the bureau adds costs to banks. However, backers of the agency point out that it has returned billions of dollars to consumers since it was formed in 2011.\nNot all of the report seeks to ease restrictions. For example, the legislation also recommends that Congress expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to play a larger role in picking a lead regulator to tackle a particular issue when multiple agencies have conflicting and overlapping jurisdiction. For example, the FSOC could pick either the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to head a particular task in a situation where the two agencies don't agree on who should have jurisdiction. The FSOC is made up of agency chiefs and seeks to identify emerging threats to the financial system.\nAlso, expect more recommendations to come. President Trump in April directed the Treasury Department to look at whether it would scrap a system set up after the 2008 crisis for handling failures of large banks. The memo orders Mnuchin to review the effects of a Dodd-Frank reform law provision creating Orderly Liquidation Authority, the power to wind down a collapsing financial institution deemed likely to threaten financial stability. Of particular concern, the president wrote, is whether the system improperly shifts costs to taxpayers, might cause excessive risk-taking and conflicts with Trump's goal of curbing unnecessary regulation. A report on the OLA is due in September or October.\n}}
{{The start of 2008 has brought a harsh reality to Wall Street: The U.S. may indeed be headed toward recession.\nMajor Market Indices\nSo, after suffering punishing losses the first three trading days of the year, the stock market will be seizing on any data or forecast in the coming weeks that can help investors determine if their worst fears are coming to pass.

On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors releases its forward-looking index of U.S. home sales for November. Economists surveyed by Thomson Financial predict the index will slip after gaining for two straight months, despite the association\u2019s forecast last month that sales and prices will start rising modestly next year.\nKB Home\u2019s quarterly earnings report Tuesday could offer further insight into whether the housing market is near its bottom or has much further to fall. The homebuilder is expected to post a loss.\nWith the job market and energy sector in focus, the Energy Department\u2019s weekly report Wednesday on crude oil, gasoline and heating oil inventories and the Labor Department\u2019s weekly reading Thursday on jobless claims will be closely monitored.\nComments from several Fed officials could also give investors a clearer view of where the economy is headed, and if inflation is a growing concern to the central bank, which meets Jan. 29-30 to decide whether to lower interest rates again for the fourth time in a row.\nOn Tuesday, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser will speak in Gladwyne, Pa., on the economy, and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren will speak in Hartford, Conn., on the economy as well. On Wednesday, St. Louis Fed President William Poole will speak in St. Louis on economic and financial literacy, and Thursday, Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig speaks on the economy in Kansas City, Mo.\nLastly, on Friday, the Commerce Department reports on November\u2019s international trade and December import prices.

Bush\u2019s death, but the effect of Wall Street\u2019s turmoil in the previous session, when New York-listed shares tumbled more than 3 percent, is being felt in Asia and Europe.\nThat pushed MSCI\u2019s all-country index down almost half a percent.\nThe declines came just a day after an equity surge driven by optimism that China and the United States would sort out their trade dispute. Then President Donald Trump threatened \u201cmajor tariffs\u201d on Chinese imports if his administration failed to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing.\n\u201cAs I look into next year, most expectations for further gains have been pared back.

Shanghai markets fell 0.6 percent, their losses limited by Chinese officials expressing confidence that a trade deal would be clinched on time.\nEuropean markets opened lower, with a pan-European index down 1.2 percent. Losses were led by a 1.6 percent decline in bank shares, which are being pummelled by the latest declines in long-dated government bond yields.\nThe moves follow similar declines in U.S. bank shares , which dropped 4.4 percent on Tuesday.\nGlobal equities have been shaken by fears of a recession, fanned by the flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve \u2014 a phenomenon in which longer-dated debt yields fall faster than their shorter-dated counterparts.\nSuch an inversion of two-year and 10-year yields, when 10-year bonds yield less than their two-year debt, has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.\n\u201cThe market decline in the U.S. overnight and the flattening of the yield curve reflect that economic growth momentum is taking over as the primary concern for investors,\u201d Tai Hui, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management told clients.\nSo far, 10-year yields are clinging to an 11-basis-point margin over the two-year, although it was the smallest one in over a decade.\nThe flattening of the curve gained momentum after last week\u2019s signal by the Federal Reserve that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate-increase cycle. It has spread to the euro zone, where the German 2-10 yield curve is at its flattest since mid-2017 at 85.70 basis points.\nGerman 10-year yields slipped to six-month lows of 0.247 percent\n\u201cThere has been a huge flight to safety in the European bond market ... (European) equities closed on Tuesday only modestly lower while there were sharp falls in the U.S.,\u201d Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING, said. \u201cThe European bond market was already preparing for trouble ahead.\u201d\nMarkets are also bracing for more news on the Brexit front.

{{Does Scorsese's \"Wolf of Wall Street\" have a homophobia problem? The new financial thriller depicts a gay man beaten and nearly killed. Is it all in good fun?\nMartin Scorsese's new film \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" has only been out for a week, but has already been the subject of a very familiar sort of controversy. Last year, it was \"Zero Dark Thirty\" -- a film depicting U.S. troops committing torture in the run-up to the killing of Osama bin Laden, and perceived to endorse that same torture; this spring, it was a debate catalyzed by novelist Claire Messud over whether characters in fiction have to or ought to be \"likable.\"\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" depicts misdeeds of every stripe -- it takes its name and its plot from the memoir by boiler-room operator Jordan Belfort, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio both as a financial manipulator and an abuser of drugs and women. L.A. Weekly ran a letter from a daughter of one of Belfort's associates condemning the film as one that simply ought not to exist, a point-of-view that would seem to make impossible much great art. The reaction to \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" has been generally befuddling, given the context both of Scorsese's past work and the film's subject matter. Of course the director of \"Goodfellas\" would direct a film that plays drug use and crime for laughs (until it doesn't). Of course a film about Wall Street would feature financial manipulation.\nAdvertisement:\nBut if the L.A. Weekly writer brought her particular history to bear on the film, so too did I; it was hard to explain away the visceral sense that the film, in its depiction of homophobia, was itself homophobic. In one scene, Belfort's butler, a gay man, throws an orgy in Belfort's home, and is then hit in the face and dangled over the edge of a skyscraper when one of his guests steals money. In another, two associates of Belfort (played by Jonah Hill and Jon Bernthal) taunt one another as \"fags\" as they fight in a parking lot.\nObviously, to depict something is not necessarily to endorse it. But a film directed by, written by and starring different sets of heterosexual men treads uncomfortably when it ventures into territory about people other than heterosexual men. It is a presumption underpinning the scenes that to be called gay is a grievous offense to these characters. Other actions in the movie get reactions: When it comes to Belfort's financial misdeeds, he's told off by an FBI agent, and when it comes to his mistreatment of his wife, his wife tells him she wants a divorce. While Belfort's never punished in a satisfying manner, the movie gives characters their times to get back at Belfort in small ways. But if there's any comment on his and his cohort's homophobia, it happens entirely in the mind of the moviegoer and not on-screen; homophobia is just the natural order of things -- of course straight men are discomfited by homosexual sex.\nGoing into art looking for one's own opinions to be ratified is dangerous -- it leads to, say, asking why pop artists aren't explicitly mentioning the gay-marriage cause. But \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which methodically builds a case against Belfort for most of his misdeeds, sort of just shrugs at his beating up a gay man, and his associates' coarse language and \"Duck Dynasty\"-ish horror at the idea of gay sex. The film depicts a period of time not very long ago -- but long enough ago that the open expressions of revulsion at gay people seem a bit shocking, now. But to Scorsese, at 71, perhaps they sound right.\nThere's something deeply didactic about \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which takes it upon itself to explain to us that the folks who committed the misdeeds that led to the 2008 stock-market crash were bad people -- look how bad, look how many drugs they used, look at their wild parties! And yet other aspects pass entirely without rebuttal. A character getting beaten and mocked for his sexuality is not better or worse than tricking people into buying valueless stocks, but one of these things gets Jordan Belfort called to the carpet by the FBI and (briefly) sent to prison, and the other just happens and then is over. The film, like most Scorsese films, depicts a universe in which to be a straight man is the norm and any other manner of being is a deviation. It's not homophobic to depict that world -- but it's definitely boring.\n}}

{{On Friday, Bear Stearns blew up. It was the worst possible news at the worst possible time. A day earlier, the politically-connected Carlyle Capital hedge fund defaulted on $16.6 billion of its debt. Carlyle boasted a $21.7 billion portfolio of AAA-rated residential mortgage-backed securities, but was unable to make a margin call of just $400 million. (Where did the $21.7 billion go?) The news on Bear was the last straw. The stock market started reeling immediately; shedding 300 points in less than an hour. Then, miraculously, the tide shifted and the market began to rebound. If there was ever a time for Paulson\u2019s Plunge Protection Team to come to the rescue; this was it. For weeks, the markets have been battered with bad news. Retail sales are down, unemployment is up, consumer confidence is in the tank, inflation is rising, the dollar is on the ropes, and the credit crunch has spread to even the safest corners of the market. Facing fierce headwinds, Washington mandarins and financial heavyweights had to decide whether to sit back and let one small investment bank take down the whole equities market in an afternoon or stealthily buy a few futures and live to fight another day? Tough choice, eh?\nWe\u2019ll never know for sure, but that\u2019s probably what happened.\nWe\u2019ll also never know if Bernanke\u2019s real purpose in setting up his new $200 billion auction facility was to provide the cash-strapped banks with a place where they could off-load the mortgage-backed junk that Carlyle dumped on the market when they went belly-up. That worked out well, didn\u2019t it? Now the banks can trade these worthless MBS bonds with the Fed for US Treasuries at nearly full value. What a deal! That must have been the plan from the get-go.\nThe Bear Stearns bailout has ignited a firestorm of controversy about moral hazard and whether the Fed should be in the business of spreading its largess to profligate investment banks. But the Fed had no choice. This isn\u2019t about one bank caving in from its bad bets. The entire financial system is teetering and a failure at Bear would have taken a wrecking ball to the equities market and sent stocks around the world into a violent death-spiral. The New York Times summed it up like this in Saturday\u2019s edition:\n\u201cIf the Fed hadn\u2019t acted this morning and Bear did default on its obligations, then that could have triggered a widespread panic and potentially a collapse of the financial system\u201d.\nBingo.\nSo, what makes Bear so special? How is it that one of the smallest investment banks can pose such a threat to the whole system?\nThat\u2019s the question that will be addressed in the next couple weeks and people are not going to like the answer. For the last decade or so the markets have been reconfigured according to a new \u201cstructured finance\u201d model which has transformed the interactions between institutions and investors. The focus has been on maximizing profit by creating a vast galaxy of exotic debt-instruments which increase overall risk and volatility in slumping market conditions. Derivatives trading which, according to the Bank of International Settlements, now exceeds $500 trillion, has sewn together the various lending and investment institutions in a way that one failure can set the derivatives dominoes in motion and bring down the entire financial scaffolding in a heap. That\u2019s why the Fed got involved and (I believe) approached Congress in a closed-door session (which was supposed to be about FISA legislation) to inform lawmakers about the growing possibly of a major economic meltdown if conditions in the credit markets were not stabilized quickly.\nThe troubles at Bear and the danger they pose to the overall system were articulated in an article by Counterpunch editor, Alexander Cockburn in a November, 2006 article \u201cLame Duck: The Downside of Capitalism\u201d:\n\u201cIn a briefing paper under the chaste title, \u2018Private Equity: A discussion of Risk and Regulatory Engagement\u2019, the FSA raises the alarm.\n\u201cExcessive leverage: The amount of credit that lenders are willing to extend on private equity transactions has risen substantially. This lending may not, in some circumstances, be entirely prudent. Given current leverage levels and recent developments in the economic/credit cycle, the default of a large private equity backed company or a cluster of smaller private equity backed companies seems inevitable. This has negative implications for lenders, purchasers of the debt, orderly markets and conceivably, in extreme circumstances, financial stability and elements of the UK economy.\u201d\nTranslation: It\u2019s about to blow!\n\u201cThe duration and potential impact of any credit event may be exacerbated by operational issues which make it difficult to identify who ultimately owns the economic risk associated with a leveraged buy out and how these owners will react in a crisis. These operational issues arise out of the extensive use of opaque, complex and time consuming risk transfer practices such as assignment and sub-participation, together with the increased use of credit derivatives. These credit derivatives may not be confirmed in a timely manner and the amount traded may substantially exceed the amount of the underlying assets.\u201d(snip)\nTranslation: \u201cThe world\u2019s credit system is a vast recycling bin of untraceable transactions of wildly inflated value.\nThe problem is that the oversight and stability of the world credit system is no longer within the purview of familiar international institutions like the International Monetary Fund or the Bank of International Settlements. Private traders are now installed at all the strategic nodes, gambling with stratospheric sums in such speculative pyramids as the credit derivative market which was almost nonexistent in 2001, yet which reached $17.3 trillion by the end of 2005. Warren Buffett, America\u2019s most famous investor, has called credit derivatives \u201cfinancial weapons of mass destruction.\u201d ( Alexander Cockburn, \u201cLame Duck: The Downside of Capitalism\u201d counterpunch.org)\nCockburn\u2019s article anticipates the current problems at Bear and shows why the Fed cannot allow them to fester and spread throughout the system. The investment banks and brokerages all do business with each other, taking sides in trades as counterparties. If one player goes down it increases the likelihood of more failures. So the problem has to be contained.\nThe volume of derivatives contracts, that are not traded publicly on any of the major exchanges, has exploded in the last few years. These unregulated transactions, what Pimco\u2019s Bill Gross calls the shadow banking system, have taken center-stage as market conditions continue to deteriorate and the downward-cycle of deleveraging begins to accelerate. The ongoing massacre in real estate has left the structured investment market frozen, which means that the foundation blocks (ie mortgage-backed securities) upon which all this excessive leveraging rests; is starting to crumble. It\u2019s a real mess.\nDerivatives trading, particularly in credit default swaps, is oftentimes exceeds the value of the underlying asset many times over. Credit Default Swaps are financial instruments that are based on loans and bonds that speculate on a company\u2019s ability to repay debt. (a type of unregulated insurance) The CDS market is roughly $45 trillion, whereas, the aggregate value of the US mortgage market is only $11 trillion; four times smaller. That\u2019s a lot of leverage and it can have a snowball effect when the CDSs trades begin to unwind.\nIn truth, the biggest risk to the financial system is counterparty risk; the possibility that some large investment bank, like Bear, goes under and sucks the rest of the market with it from the magnitude of its losses. Last year, Bear was the 12th largest counterparty to CDS trades according to Fitch ratings. If they were to suddenly disappear, the effects to the rest of the system would be catastrophic.\nFed Chairman Bernanke sat on the board of the FOMC when the investment gurus and brokerage sharpies customized the markets in a way that enhanced their own personal fortunes while increasing the risks of systemic failure. The SIVs, the conduits, the opaque derivatives, the off-balance sheets operations, the dark pools, the massive leverage, and the reckless expansion of credit; all emerged during his (and Greenspan\u2019s) tenure. The Federal Reserve is largely responsible for the brushfire they are presently trying to put out.\nNow, once again, Bernanke is acting beyond his mandate and invoking a law that hasn\u2019t been used since the 1960s so the Fed can become the creditor for an institution that attempted to enrich itself through wild speculative bets on dubious toxic investments which are now utterly worthless. If that isn\u2019t a good enough reason for abolishing the Federal Reserve; then what is?\nThe world\u2019s most transparent and profitable markets have been transformed into a carnival sideshow managed by hucksters, flim-flam men, and rip off artists. The Bear bailout is yet another glaring example of a system that lacks all credibility and is quickly self-destructing.\n}}

{{The Wall Street Journal has an editorial inexplicably siding with Michelle Obama against Sarah Palin on the issue of Mrs. Obama's campaign against childhood obesity.\nThe Journal: \"Adults do have an obligation to teach children how to live, and that includes adults who are role models by dint of their national prominence. JFK asked kids to do chinups for the Presidential Fitness Award...\"\nBathing the President's Council on Physical Fitness retrospectively in the aura of JFK is nice, but the fact is that the program, according to its own history, began not under JFK, but rather, like so many other ill-conceived big government programs, under the guidance of Richard Nixon, who was the founding chairman. Childhood obesity reportedly has soared since the program was created, so it's not exactly clear that it's such a great example for Ms. Obama to follow.\nThe Journal goes on: \"A National Bureau of Economic Research study released in October puts the annual cost of treating obesity and related preventable chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and orthopedic issues at $168 billion, or 16.5% of all U.S. spending on medical care. Nearly one out of three children are overweight or obese. Many of these costs are transferred to taxpayers via Medicare, other entitlements and soon ObamaCare.\"\nWhat about the government's share of the costs of motorcycle accidents? Ski accidents? Bicycle accidents? Before you know it, government health care programs become the rationale for the government to issue advice or take more coercive measures on all kinds of behavior. This is a reason to be skeptical of government health care programs, not a reason to endorse Mrs. Obama's initiative.\nThe Journal editorial goes on to call Mrs. Obama's campaign \"unusual for this White House in emphasizing personal responsibility.\" The Journal editorial adds, \"The first lady has also so far eschewed the coercion of the public health lobby, like junk food regulation and taxes and advertising restrictions.\"\nThe Journal editorial writers must have been on vacation back on February 19, when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner took a break from his job-creation efforts to fetch up with the first lady and the federal secretary of agriculture at a Philadelphia grocery store. Said Mr. Geithner:\nTreasury is devoting $250 million towards New Markets Tax Credits which provide a powerful incentive for private investors to take a chance on projects - like a new healthier grocery store - in distressed communities that have potential. That incentive is a tax credit, valued at 39 percent of the investment's total cost and claimed over a seven-year period. And through this innovative partnership with the private sector, local developers are able to create new jobs and services for residents in their community. In addition, we are providing $25 million in Treasury grants to certified community development financial institutions that have already been successful in increasing healthier food options in distressed areas and that, with our support, will be able to do even more. This morning, the First Lady, Secretary Vilsack and I toured the Fresh Grocer Supermarket. Thanks to New Markets Tax Credits and one of those Treasury grants made possible by the Recovery Act, Fresh Grocer was able to open a few months ago and now provides affordable, fresh food - including produce from local farmers - to the North Philadelphia community.\nThe Journal says Mrs. Obama has eschewed coercion. But there's nothing optional or non-coercive about the $275 million in tax dollars that are being taken by government force from taxpayers and used to subsidize new firms. I've been meaning to get to Philadelphia to check out this supermarket and, more importantly, ask other stores in the neighborhood how they feel about having their tax dollars taken to subsidize a new competitor that Mrs. Obama and the Treasury secretary like because it offers produce from local farmers. But for those of us out in the real economy trying to start businesses without the benefit of Treasury grants or 39% tax credits \u2014 well, let's just say that from here it looks like Sarah Palin understands what Michelle Obama and Timothy Geithner are up to a whole lot better than do the editorial writers of the Wall Street Journal.\n}}

{{By Mike Fleming Jr\nRed Granite Pictures, which just formed an international sales division to be headed by ex-Nu Image execs Danny Dimbort and Christian Mercuri, has just bought into a big project. Red Granite chairman/CEO Riza Aziz and vice chairman Joey McFarland have acquired rights to Jordan Belfort\u2019s memoir The Wolf of Wall Street and will produce with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Killoran\u2019s Appian Way and Alexandra Milchan\u2019s EMJAG Productions. DiCaprio has long wanted to play Belfort, with directors Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott among those who\u2019s sparked to directing the film. There were reports recently that Scorsese might resurface, but no director is set yet and there isn\u2019t a start date. The project had been set at Warner Bros and nearly got made several years ago, but a tug of war between that studio and Paramount (where Scorsese has his overall deal) led them to instead collaborate on Shutter Island.\nScript was written by Terence Winter, the exec producer of The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. The drama chronicles Belfort\u2019s rise and fall on Wall Street, a run marked by a hard-partying lifestyle, drug addiction, a 1998 indictment for securities fraud and money laundering. And a 22-month federal prison stretch. Belfort has been sober 14 years and is a motivational speaker.\nRed Granite\u2019s intention is to produce four to five films each year and make negative pickups. Along with Dimbort and Mercuri, the company brought Millennium Films production head Joe Gatta in as president, to oversee production operations. Red Granite most recently completed the Jennifer Westfelt-directed Friends with Kids, which stars Jon Hamm, Megan Fox, Westfeldt, Kristin Wiig and Adam Scott.\nDicaprio is repped by Rick Yorn.\n}}
{{C. Wright Mills, the radical Columbia University sociologist who died 50 years ago (March 20, 1962) at age 45, would have loved Occupy Wall Street. In the 1950s, when most college professors were cautious about their political views and lifestyles, Mills rode a motorcycle to work; wore plaid shirts, jeans and work boots instead of flannel suits; built his house with his own hands; and, in a torrent of books and articles, warned that America was becoming a nation of \"cheerful robots,\" heading toward a third world war and was being corrupted by an economic elite.\nIn three books published between 1948 and 1956 -- The New Men of Power, White Collar and The Power Elite -- Mills challenged the widely held belief that American society, having triumphed over the fundamental problems of the 20th century (depression, war and fascism) had become a model of economic success, political democracy and social well-being. At a time when social scientists and journalists were extolling America's post-World War II prosperity, Mills warned about the dangers of the growing concentration of wealth and power.\nMills' most influential book, The Power Elite, published in 1956, challenged the predominant view that America was a classless society and that all segments of society -- farmers, workers, middle-class consumers, small business and big business -- had an equal voice in its democracy. Instead, he described the power structure created by overlapping circles of business, military and political leaders whose big decisions determined the nation's destiny, including war and peace.\nThe academic and media establishment attacked Mills' caustic critique of what he called the \"American celebration.\" His was a lonely voice among academic sociologists, but his books sold well, suggesting that at least some Americans were not happy with the postwar status quo. His writings eventually struck a chord with a significant segment of the American public and with the small but growing radical movement on college campuses. In a 1961 article, \"Who Are the Student Boat-rockers?\" in Mademoiselle magazine, student activist Tom Hayden listed the three people over 30 whom young radicals most admired. They were Norman Thomas, Michael Harrington and Mills.\nMany of Mills' ideas, considered radical in his day, are now taken for granted. His phrase \"power elite\" -- criticized by conservatives and liberals at the time -- is widely used today by the mainstream media. Public opinion today has now swung in Mills' direction. Even many Americans who don't agree with Occupy Wall Street's tactics or rhetoric nevertheless share its indignation at outrageous corporate profits, widening inequality and excessive executive compensation side by side with the epidemic of layoffs and foreclosures. Most Americans now recognize that the biggest corporations and the very wealthy have disproportionate political influence. A Pew Research Center survey released in December found that most Americans (77 percent) -- including a majority (53 percent) of Republicans -- agree that \"there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations.\" Pew also discovered that 61 percent of Americans believe that \"the economic system in this country unfairly favors the wealthy.\" A significant majority (57 percent) think that wealthy people don't pay their fair share of taxes.\nWhether they refer to the elite as the \"establishment,\" the \"power structure\" or the \"top 1 percent,\" Americans understand that this concentration of power subverts democracy. They see the revolving door among corporate board rooms, top military brass and the cabinet -- exemplified by men like Robert Rubin, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, John Snow, Tim Geithner and John Bryson who served in the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations. They know that corporate campaign contributions buy access and influence and tilt the political playing field toward big business interests, made worse by the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling in 2010 that individuals and corporations can exercise almost unlimited \"free speech\" through political donations. The current wave of SuperPACs dominating our elections, funded primarily by millionaires and billionaires, reflects the corruption of democracy by big money.\n***\nGrowing up in a middle class family, Charles Wright Mills graduated from Dallas Technical High School in 1934. After a year at Texas A&M University, he transferred to the University of Texas, graduating with a degree in philosophy in 1939. He earned his Ph.D. in sociology at the University of Wisconsin, where he focused his research on social psychology and social theory. After a brief stint teaching at the University of Maryland, he arrived at Columbia in 1945 to work at the university's new survey research center and teach sociology. He remained at Columbia until he died of a heart attack in 1962.\nAt Columbia, Mills mastered the techniques of social research, particularly the skills of conducting interviews and doing large surveys, which he used to carry out several projects that his senior colleagues suggested. But Mills was restless. He wanted to use his academic perch to reach outside academia, influence public thinking and help build a progressive movement.\nIn New York City, he met a widening circle of radicals and rebels, like novelist Harvey Swados, critic Dwight McDonald and labor activist J.B. S Hardman, who expanded Mills' political horizons. He quickly became what today we call a \"public intellectual,\" writing essays for progressive and left-wing opinion magazines like the New Republic; The Nation; New Leader; Partisan Review; Dissent; and especially Politics, which criticized America's warfare state and sought ways to invigorate grassroots democracy.\nThe country Mills wrote about had overcome the Depression, triumphed over fascism in World War II and was in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom. The gross national product and the standard of living increased rapidly in the postwar decade. A growing number of American families were able afford to move to the suburbs, buy homes, install air conditioners, purchase a new contraption called a television, pay for a new car every few years, take a yearly vacation (and stay at a new phenomenon called a \"motel\") and even fly on an airplane. They could send their children to college and save money for a comfortable retirement.\nThe postwar prosperity was fueled by big government initiatives -- a massive national highway-building program; huge subsidies and financial aid to expand the college and university system; federal insurance to increase home building and home buying; and, most importantly, an immense defense budget. All this government spending boosted employment and put money in people's pockets, stimulating the consumer demand that provided America's businesses with record profits.\nBusiness, political, religious and academic leaders justified all this government spending as critical to winning the cold war. Russia, Japan, Germany and the rest of Europe had been destroyed -- economically and physically -- by the war. The United States, in contrast, was the dominant economic and military superpower in the world. American businesses were able to produce goods -- cars, cameras, TVs, movies, blue jeans and sodas -- that would sell at home and around the world.\nBut most business and political leaders warned, all this could end unless the United States was ready to stop the spread of Communism, especially in Europe and the poor nations of the world. American schools and universities had to train the next generation of skilled workers, corporate managers, school teachers and scientists, particularly to compete with Russia, which launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957. We even had to be prepared, if necessary, to fight a war with the Soviet Union.\nThe vast defense budget -- what some called a \"permanent war economy\" -- paid for expensive new weapons systems; military bases around the world; and millions of American civilians and troops employed by the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and private military contractors. At home, the fear of Communists and other radicals led to the hysteria called McCarthyism, led by business groups worried about stronger unions and higher taxes and by politicians who got into office by scaring voters about the Red Menace taking over the public schools, unions, Hollywood and universities.\nMills rebelled against this conventional thinking. In his first few years at Columbia, Mills joined a network of academics who provided research to help union leaders understand the major social and economic changes facing their members. A wave of militant strikes across the country after the war and an increase in union membership gave radicals hope that the labor movement would be in the forefront of progressive change. Mills' ties to the labor movement led to the first of his major books on what he called the \"main drift\" of American society -- The New Men of Power: America's Labor Leaders, published in 1948.\nWhen Mills was writing the book, union membership had increased fivefold in the previous decade and represented one-third of non-farm workers. He believed that unions could be a bulwark against America's drift toward \"war and slump\" by pushing to convert the war economy to civilian uses, improving workers' incomes and job security and giving ordinary Americans a voice in government to challenge big business power.\nAt the core of The New Men of Power is Mills' survey of 500 labor leaders. He discovered that blue-collar workers' route to the middle class was more likely to occur via better union contracts than by being recruited into the ranks of corporate management. He found that CIO union leaders were more progressive than their AFL counterparts, that many were open to the idea of a third political party based in the labor movement and that an astonishing 69 percent of industrial union leaders believed that the potential for fascism was a real threat in the United States. Mills was particularly impressed with Walter Reuther, who had just been elected president of the United Auto Workers, and other progressive union leaders whom he hoped would move the labor movement leftward.\nMills examined the other major segments in American society contending for political power. He warned that moderates in big business and conservatives among small business, both well-entrenched within the Republican Party, as well as mainstream business-friendly cold-war liberals within the Democratic Party, could marginalize or even co-opt the labor movement. He dismissed the far left (particularly the Communist Party) and the far right as too small and isolated to be influential.\nMills' chapter, \"The Program of the Left,\" outlined a labor-based radical agenda that was really an expansion of the New Deal plus a call for halting the arms race and the war economy. It reflected bits and pieces of the views of Norman Thomas' Socialist Party, Walter Reuther's UAW and what would later that year become former Vice President Wallace Henry Wallace's Progressive Party campaign for the White House. It included proposals for consumer cooperatives, neighborhood committees to monitor business practices (including the continuation of war-time price controls) and workplace democracy.\nThe New Men of Power was cautiously optimistic about the labor movement's potential. But in 1947, while Mills was writing the book, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act over President Harry Truman's veto, which weakened unions' ability to organize. Mills was also disappointed when, in the 1948 elections, the AFL and CIO unions (including the UAW) endorsed Truman over Thomas (whom Mills voted for). In that political climate, few major union leaders were inclined to challenge the cold war, the arms race and the attacks on radical dissent. Indeed, most unions would soon purge themselves of their radical leaders as part of the Red Scare hysteria. Mills drifted away from working with progressive labor activists as his confidence in the labor movement gave way to skepticism.\n***\nHaving examined the blue-collar working class, Mills' next book, White Collar: The American Middle Classes, published in 1951, explored the social conditions and psychology of the growing strata of Americans in the professions and middle management, living in urban neighborhoods and suburbs and exemplifying the \"American way of life\" that the nation's leaders contrasted with the drab and compliant life in Communist Russia.\nBased on interviews and surveys as well as analysis of popular culture, Mills concluded that many middle-class Americans were socially, intellectually and politically stifled, trapped working in offices in large business bureaucracies over which they had no control (including no union representation). Instead of finding pleasure and pride in craftsmanship at work, they pursued happiness and status by buying things they didn't need and living without much purpose. He coined the phrase \"cheerful robot\" to decry the unthinking conformity of much of America's middle-class culture.\nIn a speech in England, Mills described what he meant:\nWe know that men can be turned into robots -- by chemical means, by physical coercion, as in concentration camps and so on. But we are now confronting a situation more serious than that -- a situation in which there are developed human beings who are cheerfully and willingly turning themselves into robots.\nMills believed that such conformity was an aspect of what he called \"mass society\" -- a condition of widespread political apathy that allowed business and political leaders to pursue the arms race and the potential for a nuclear war without much opposition.\nMills' critique was not unique. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, there were other indications that many Americans were coming to question the nation's moral and psychological condition. The novel (1955) and film (1956) The Man in the Grey-Flannel Suit disparaged the lifestyle of middle-class managers. J.D. Salinger's popular 1951 novel, Catcher in the Rye; the 1955 film starring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause; and Paul Goodman's 1960 book, Growing Up Absurd, all depicted the alienation of middle-class youth, raging against \"phonies.\" Best-selling books by sociologically oriented journalists -- William H. White's The Organization Man (1956) and Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuaders (1957) and The Status Seekers (1959) -- expressed alarm during the height of the Eisenhower administration at the influence of corporate employers, advertisers and suburban developers in shaping the daily lives of American families. Arthur Miller's 1949 play, Death of a Salesman, struck a similar chord. In 1952, two left-wing writers, William Gaines and Harvey Kurtzman, launched MAD, a comics magazine of political and social satire that became an instant sensation with the baby-boom generation. It poked fun at middle-class suburbia, the cold war and advertising. Its slogan, \"What? Me Worry?\" was intentionally ironic because many Americans were quite worried about the escalating arms race, the proliferation of fall-out shelters and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust. Malvina Reynolds' 1962 song \"Little Boxes\" poked fun at the look-alike housing developments in postwar suburbs and the complacency of the people who lived in them.\n***\nThe Power Elite, published in 1956, was the most radical, controversial and widely read of Mills' three major books. It caused a firestorm in academic and political circles. America has a ruling elite, Mills wrote, and its most active members -- top corporate executives -- have little sense of social responsibility. Rather, they work collaboratively with the top military leaders and their allies in Congress and the White House (former Gen. and World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower was the Republican president at the time) to shape the nation's major priorities based primarily on greed and self-interest. The various interest groups that could contend for power -- farmer organizations, labor unions, big-city mayors and others - fought over crumbs left over after the big spending decisions, particularly the military budget, had already been decided.\nMills pointed out that the corporate, military and political elites were not separate spheres, but overlapping groups at the \"command posts\" of society. Top corporate executives (such as Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, former General Motors CEO Charles Wilson) were recruited to serve in the cabinet and on numerous committees providing advice to the White House and Congress. Retired generals and admirals (whom Mills called \"warlords\") went to work for major defense corporations, using their influence to argue for bigger military budgets, new weapons systems and government contracts for their new employers. Corporate executives and Pentagon leaders lobbied Congress to increase the military budget, pointing out that it would create jobs in defense plants and military bases in their districts.\nMills was particularly concerned that few newspapers, academics or religious leaders spoke out against this concentration of power. Instead, most went along with the power elite's ideology -- a stance Mills called \"crackpot realism,\" which involves dangerous, irresponsible ideas that the public accepts as normal. One such idea was \"mutually assured destruction\" -- that a world war could be averted if both the US and Soviet Union had enough weapons to destroy each other. Mills hated Soviet totalitarianism, but he thought the US and USSR could cooperate to avoid a costly arms race and a possible nuclear holocaust.\nMills' critique of America's power structure was dramatically at odds with the prevailing view of American democracy taught in high schools and colleges at the time. This idea -- \"pluralism\" -- viewed government as a neutral umpire among contending interest groups of roughly equal power. But Mills' view found unlikely validation in President Eisenhower's farewell address on January 17, 1961, which warned about the \"unwarranted influence\" of the \"military industrial complex,\" an idea very similar to the power elite. During the 1960s and 1970s, The Power Elite (along with Floyd Hunter's \"Community Power Structure,\" a study of Atlanta published in 1953) inspired hundreds of studies by academics that examined the overlapping networks of corporate influence on local and national politics. Community organizing groups, unions, and other activists learned how to conduct power structure research in order to expose its web of relationships and find ways to challenge its influence and hold it accountable.\n***\nBy the time he wrote The Power Elite, Mills had given up hope that a resurgent labor movement could revitalize American democracy. He seemed oblivious to the burgeoning civil rights movement that had erupted in Montgomery in 1955. (In fact, he was oblivious to issues of race throughout his writings.)\nBut Mills' books, particularly The Power Elite, resonated with the growing mood of discontent in the nation, particularly on college campuses. For example, its influence can be seen in the \"Port Huron Statement,\" the founding manifesto of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), written in 1962. The \"Statement's\" principal author, Tom Hayden and other SDS leaders, like sociologist Dick Flacks, greatly admired Mills. The \"Statement's\" analysis of power and its call for \"participatory democracy\" echoed Mills' views.\nDuring the last few years of his life, a few trends -- the rise of student activism in the United States and Europe; the Cuban revolution in 1959; and the awakening of anti-colonial movements in Africa, Asia and South America -- gave Mills a new sense of hope. Energized by these movements, he quickly wrote two short books -- which he called \"pamphlets\" -- that he aimed for a wide audience. The Causes of World War Three (1958), an impassioned plea for an end to the nuclear arms race, sold over 100,000 copies. Listen, Yankee (1960), a sympathetic look at the Cuban revolution from the viewpoint of a Cuban revolutionary, sold over 400,000 copies. In the fall of 1960, he published a Letter to the New Left in the British journal New Left Review, encouraging young radicals around the world.\nMills' writing combined analysis and outrage. He was a meticulous researcher, but he did not wish to be what he called a \"sociological bookkeeper.\" He wrote about the fundamental questions facing American society and he had strong opinions. \"I try to be objective,\" Mills wrote, \"I do not claim to be detached.\"\nToward the end of his life, the mainstream media began asking Mills for his views on major issues of the day. In December 1960, he was invited to appear on the NBC television show The Nation's Future to debate A.A. Berle, a spokesperson for the newly elected Kennedy administration, about US policy in Latin America. On the eve of the program, Mills suffered a heart attack and had to cancel the debate. He never fully recovered his remarkable energy. A second heart attack on March 20, 1962, was fatal. He didn't live to see the emergence of the student and antiwar movements that his work helped inspire.\nFew Occupy Wall Street activists have probably heard of Mills or are familiar with his work. But Mills' breakthrough ideas -- especially his notion of the \"power elite\" -- resonate today with the growing recognition that too much wealth and power in the hands of the superrich undermines democracy.\n}}
{{Apparently, the United States government has been eavesdropping on 35 world leaders. Too bad we didn\u2019t learn what most of those nations \u2014 and the rest of the developed world \u2014 already figured out: that we can end the revenue crisis in America by taxing Wall Street.\nWe simply do not have the federal resources needed to spur the kinds of investments it will take to rebuild communities and put people back to work. So we need more money. And there\u2019s money to be found. Not in grandma's pension or grandpa's Medicare, not in our children's classrooms, and not in programs that protect the poorest among us. The money is on Wall Street.\nAdvertisement:\nLegislation introduced in Congress would institute a 0.5 percent tax on stocks, a 0.1 percent tax on bonds and a 0.005 percent levy on derivatives and currency. That\u2019s literally fractions of costs to Wall Street, but these small taxes would raise approximately $350 billion annually. And 40 nations \u2014 including Singapore, Hong Kong and the U.K. \u2014 already have such a tax. Instituting this basic tax in the United States wouldn\u2019t hurt Wall Street but would simply bring our policies into line with the rest of the global economy.\nAmerica has been through economic crises and recessions before, but what we\u2019ve never done is recover through cuts and austerity. Rebuilding our economy means literally rebuilding, investing public money to strengthen our infrastructure, invest in our education system and create jobs that help get our nation back on its feet. It\u2019s time for the next generation of big, bold investments to launch the next great wave of American innovation and prosperity \u2014 the kinds of investments that brought us Social Security, a railroad system, cures to disease, and provided jobs and security to generations of Americans and will get us on our feet yet again.\nThe question, then, is: Who should pay? Are seniors, students, the poor and working class expected to continue to make all the sacrifices? Or will those who benefit the most from the laws -- and in many cases lack of laws \u2014 of our nation pay their fair share and fully contribute to the rebuilding of this country.\nModest taxes on Wall Street transfers is a chance for America to make game-changing investments in our people and our infrastructure. It is also a means of making sure bankers on Wall Street pay their fair share.\nThis isn\u2019t another \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d where everybody loses \u2014 it\u2019s a Grand Vision for a better tomorrow, built by American investment and ingenuity, and funded by the part of our economy that is already humming along.\nThe fact is that I pay a sales tax when I buy clothes for my daughter, but there is no tax on Wall Street trades. All a transaction tax would do is close this loophole exception for Wall Street, which would generate $350 billion that we can invest in projects and programs that help all Americans.\nAdvertisement:\nAccording to a 2013 poll by Hart Research Associates, 62 percent of Americans support a small tax on stock, bond and market trades. The same poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans want corporations to pay more in taxes.\nAnd yet in Washington, conservatives continue to push for massive cuts, and refuse to have new revenues on the table in any budget negotiations. Meanwhile a number of Democrats show signs of buying into an austerity agenda, negotiating with themselves before the negotiations have actually begun. Not only is this bad policy, it\u2019s bad politics. The American people support raising revenues \u2014 politicians, especially Democrats, just have to put their finger in the wind on this one and do the right thing.\nWe need public investment to jump-start our still-too-sluggish economy. That money should come not from slashing investments on our grandparents and our children but from a tiny little pinprick of a tax on Wall Street \u2014 a tiny tax that will raise a ton of revenue. And then we can get America working again and back in line with the world economy \u2014 and not a moment too soon.\n}}
{{Financial workers at Wall Street's top banks are to receive pay deals worth more than $70bn (\u00a340bn), a substantial proportion of which is expected to be paid in discretionary bonuses, for their work so far this year - despite plunging the global financial system into its worst crisis since the 1929 stock market crash, the Guardian has learned.\nStaff at six banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are in line to pick up the payouts despite being the beneficiaries of a $700bn bail-out from the US government that has already prompted criticism. The government's cash has been poured in on the condition that excessive executive pay would be curbed.\nPay plans for bankers have been disclosed in recent corporate statements. Pressure on the US firms to review preparations for annual bonuses increased yesterday when Germany's Deutsche Bank said many of its leading traders would join Josef Ackermann, its chief executive, in waiving millions of euros in annual payouts.\nThe sums that continue to be spent by Wall Street firms on payroll, payoffs and, most controversially, bonuses appear to bear no relation to the losses incurred by investors in the banks. Shares in Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have declined by more than 45% since the start of the year. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have fallen by more than 60%. JP MorganChase fell 6.4% and Lehman Brothers has collapsed.\nAt one point last week the Morgan Stanley $10.7bn pay pot for the year to date was greater than the entire stock market value of the business. In effect, staff, on receiving their remuneration, could club together and buy the bank.\nIn the first nine months of the year Citigroup, which employs thousands of staff in the UK, accrued $25.9bn for salaries and bonuses, an increase on the previous year of 4%. Earlier this week the bank accepted a $25bn investment by the US government as part of its bail-out plan.\nAt Goldman Sachs the figure was $11.4bn, Morgan Stanley $10.73bn, JP Morgan $6.53bn and Merrill Lynch $11.7bn. At Merrill, which was on the point of going bust last month before being taken over by Bank of America, the total accrued in the last quarter grew 76% to $3.49bn. At Morgan Stanley, the amount put aside for staff compensation also grew in the last quarter to the end of August by 3% to $3.7bn.\nDays before it collapsed into bankruptcy protection a month ago Lehman Brothers revealed $6.12bn of staff pay plans in its corporate filings. These payouts, the bank insisted, were justified despite net revenue collapsing from $14.9bn to a net outgoing of $64m.\nNone of the banks the Guardian contacted wished to comment on the record about their pay plans. But behind the scenes, one source said: \"For a normal person the salaries are very high and the bonuses seem even higher. But in this world you get a top bonus for top performance, a medium bonus for mediocre performance and a much smaller bonus if you don't do so well.\"\nMany critics of investment banks have questioned why firms continue to siphon off billions of dollars of bank earnings into bonus pools rather than using the funds to shore up the capital position of the crisis-stricken institutions. One source said: \"That's a fair question - and it may well be that by the end of the year the banks start review the situation.\"\nMuch of the anger about investment banking bonuses has focused on boardroom executives such as former Lehman boss Dick Fuld, who was paid $485m in salary, bonuses and options between 2000 and 2007.\nLast year Merrill Lynch's chairman Stan O'Neal retired after announcing losses of $8bn, taking a final pay deal worth $161m. Citigroup boss Chuck Prince left last year with a $38m in bonuses, shares and options after multibillion-dollar write-downs. In Britain, Bob Diamond, Barclays president, is one of the few investment bankers whose pay is public. Last year he received a salary of \u00a3250,000, but his total pay, including bonuses, reached \u00a336m.\n}}
{{I thought Gould was right. And reading his post, I was also alerted to an insight that Douglas Rushkoff had at CNN.com. \"We are witnessing America's first true Internet-era movement,\" Rushkoff wrote, \"which does not take its cue from a charismatic leader, express itself in bumper-sticker-length goals and understand itself as having a particular endpoint. ... unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop, this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. As the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus. It is not like a book; it is like the Internet.\"\nHmmm.\nWhat does it mean for a protest movement to be like the Internet?\nFor me, that was one of those get-up-and-get-a-beer lines. \"A Get-up-and-Get-a-Beer-Line isn't a bad line,\" explains Mickey Kaus. \"It's often a good line, a line cherished and protected like a beloved child by its proud author. But it's a line packed with so much resonant meaning, or so many different possible meanings -- all interesting and profound! -- that you get up to get a beer ....\"\nI got up and got a beer.\nThen I went to a nearby beach with my fiance and her dog. The dog's name is Isabel, and once she reaches the sand, she runs very fast in a huge circle, encircling us in paw prints, then sprints to the water, where for reasons unknown she pulls all the stray pieces of kelp she can from the shoreline up to dry sand. As she does this vital work, there is sun-speckled blue water all the way to the horizon, occasional pelicans gliding by, a bluff as backdrop with small waterfalls trickling down.\nI'd forgotten all about Occupy Wall Street.\nYet J.J. Gould's piece and Douglas Rushkoff's thoughts must have been working their way through my subconscious, because when I got home that night, a post started to form in my mind. I still didn't quite grok what it meant to have a non-narrative protest movement that resembled the Internet more than a book. But I worked out some other thoughts on screen for an hour, finally coming up with an item titled \"Occupy Wall Street's Biggest Strength Is Neutering It.\"\nRoughly 11,000 people read it, as best I can tell.\nHere is the CliffsNote version: If you're raging against the symbol of Wall Street, your message is going to resonate with a lot of people. But it's so abstract that it's going to provoke a backlash too -- after all, for some people Wall Street remains a symbol of free enterprise and meritocracy. The case against symbolic Wall Street turns out to be weaker than the one against actual Wall Street, I wrote, since actual Wall Street's firms did specific unethical and illegal things.\nTo practice the kind of grounded-in-the-real-world critique I was preaching, I even offered a specific criticism of actual Wall Street.\n}}

{{(Reuters) - Netflix Inc hooked 7 million new streaming subscribers from July to September, a third more than Wall Street had expected, reassuring investors who had worried the company was facing a slowdown in its fast-paced growth.\nThe record number of additions in the third quarter brought Netflix\u2019s customer base to 137 million worldwide, confirming its rank as by far the world\u2019s biggest online subscription video service.\nNetflix shares, already up about 78 percent so far this year, jumped 14 percent to $394.25 in after-hours trading, and boosted other high-tech stocks.\nThe leap in subscribers marked a sharp turnaround from three months ago, when investors sent Netflix shares tumbling 14 percent after it missed Wall Street\u2019s subscriber growth targets.\n\u201cThe question at the end of Q2 was whether that miss was an aberration or signs of a longer-term slowdown in the business,\u201d said Forrester Research analyst Jim Nail. \u201cThe answer: an aberration, likely the results of a somewhat low volume of new content last quarter.\u201d\nNetflix\u2019s results sent shares of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent higher in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years.\nHIGH CONFIDENCE\nNetflix is investing more than $8 billion in entertainment programming this year to lure new customers around the world. In the third quarter, it released its largest slate of original TV shows and movies to date, including new seasons of hits such as \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d and \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d\nThat paid off in terms of new subscribers. Wall Street analysts had expected Netflix to add about 5.2 million streaming customers in the quarter.\nThe company exceeded forecasts in both U.S. and international markets. Netflix said it signed up roughly 1.1 million subscribers in the United States, above analysts\u2019 estimate of 674,000, according to Refinitiv. Its international business added nearly 5.9 million subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 4.5 million.\nIn a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it saw \u201cstrong growth broadly across all our markets including Asia.\u201d\nExecutives said audiences welcomed shows tailored to specific markets, such as \u201cSacred Games\u201d in India, which the company identified as key to its expansion.\n\u201cWe feel like we have a long, long runway ahead of us in India,\u201d Greg Peters, chief product officer, said in a post-earnings video interview.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix forecast it will add 1.8 million customers in the United States and 7.6 million in international markets.\n\u201cWe want to assure investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past,\u201d Netflix said in its letter.\nCOMPETITION\nDuring the September quarter, Netflix added about 676 hours of original programming in the United States, a 135 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Cowen and Co analysts.\nNetflix has been borrowing heavily to fund such rapid growth in TV shows and movies. It has issued a net $7.5 billion of bonds in less than three years, though that could carry a cost in a changing economic environment.\n\u201cRising interest rates could make Netflix increasingly vulnerable to higher cost of capital,\u201d CFRA research analyst Tuna Amobi said.\nAt the same time, Netflix faces competition from deep-pocketed companies such as Amazon and new streaming services from Walt Disney Co and AT&T Inc that are expected late next year.\nNetflix said it expects operating margins at the lower end of the 10 percent to 11 percent range for the full year 2018. It cut its projection of negative cash flow to closer to $3 billion. The company had previously projected $3 billion to minus $4 billion.\nNeil Begley, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, estimated that Netflix may spend closer to $9 billion on content this year, but he said keeping negative free cash flow to about $3 billion would not change the company\u2019s capital needs.\nThe Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably still be the case that they\u2019re going to stick to raising debt twice a year,\u201d he said.\nNetflix\u2019s net income rose to $402.8 million, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $129.6 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of 68 cents, according to Refinitiv.\nTotal revenue rose to $4 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, from $2.98 billion a year earlier.\n}}
{{In the years leading up to worst financial crisis since the Depression, as gambling fever seized Wall Street, one of the primary forces encouraging greater risk was the way that executives at major banks were compensated: Aggressive moves that made stock prices soar in the short-term triggered hefty bonuses, and even when those same moves led to longer-term disasters, the chieftains got to keep the money, leaving taxpayers on the hook for the losses.\nA new regulatory framework and much talk of lessons learned was supposed to have changed all that, putting the fortunes of the bank chiefs on the line, and tying their pay to the longer-term health of their companies.\nBut that has not happened, according to a provocative report released Tuesday by the Council of Institutional Investors, an association of public and private pension funds. Despite tougher rhetoric among regulators in Washington and a virtual consensus that poorly designed pay structures were a leading cause of the financial crisis, the same perverse incentives that encouraged bank executives to speculate dangerously remain in place, the report concludes.\nWithin the terse, jargon-laden words of a largely academic report, a disturbing warning can be found between the lines: Americans, still struggling to dig out from near-double digit unemployment and the loss of trillions of dollars in wealth, are no less vulnerable to a financial crisis today than they were before the taxpayer financed bailouts of Wall Street.\nIn the wake of the crisis, a series of regulatory initiatives have aimed to pressure big financial firms to more closely align their pay practices with the interests of shareholders. Despite this, chief executives are still effectively rewarded for boosting short term stock performance even when the result is long-term trouble, according to the report.\nDuring the real estate boom, out-sized bonuses emerged as a crucial incentive driving excessive speculation. Chiefs of major mortgage companies cashed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonuses by driving up their stock prices through indiscriminate lending. As their institutions wrote loans to seemingly anyone who could sign their name -- and even some people who couldn't -- their loan volumes exploded, and Wall Street cheered. By the time the markets figured out that many of these new homeowners were unable to make their payments, sticking the banks with sometimes-fatal losses, the chiefs had already sold their stock.\nIndeed, as real estate exploded and bank revenues multiplied, Wall Street bonuses dwarfed those at other Fortune 50 companies, according to data compiled by Council of Institutional Investors. Before the financial crisis, the average Wall Street chief executive netted a cash bonus of $8 million, compared to $3.4 million at other large companies. As many experts have argued, this situation created an incentive for bank chief to focus on large short-term returns above all else, knowing they would handsomely rewarded for immediate success.\nThe new rules on executive pay -- which landed as part of the stimulus spending package delivered by the Obama administration last year -- have limited bonuses, in what many experts see as a well-intentioned attempt to curb dangerous risk-taking. But in response, many large firms have merely handed executives larger base salaries, including hefty helpings of stock that they are able to cash regardless of how their companies fare.\n\"While compensation levels fell overall, the declines were modest and the new rules resulted in a less performance-related compensation structure,\" the report asserts.\nUltimately, the damaging incentives governing Wall Street will not be repaired until bank chiefs have so much of their wealth tied up in their companies that they fear the consequences of reckless speculation, argues the study's lead author, Paul Hodgson, a researcher at the Corporate Library, a research institution focused on corporate governance.\n\"The concept of losing their stock holdings, or their stock holdings being significantly damaged in value, was not as scary as it would be if that's where all their personal wealth were being held,\" he said. \"If there's a prospect of them not getting any type of compensation at all, if the risks they're taking lead to the collapse of the firm, then that really focuses attention.\"\nExperts have long argued that paying bank chiefs smaller bonuses and larger allotments of stock would encourage them to safeguard their companies' long-term interests. As early as 1990, an influential report argued that equity compensation encourages executives to maximize their company's value, rather than just their own. As lawmakers tightened Wall Street regulations after the financial crisis, and as then-pay czar Kenneth Feinberg examined Wall Street bonuses, a common refrain among regulators was that equity pay made things safer.\nBut the council report concludes that simply focusing on boosting stock as a percentage of overall compensation inadequately protects against excessive risk-taking by banking executives.\n\"The levels of vested and realized compensation were so high that they allowed executives to treat unvested equity with more recklessness than might be expected,\" the report reads.\nThe report even asserts that Wall Street banks have exploited the view that larger awards of stock in executive pay packages amounts to responsible corporate governance, taking the opportunity to distribute extra shares that have boosted overall pay.\n\"In the tradition of unintended consequences for compensation regulations, while incentives were capped, salaries, which were not capped, ballooned,\" the study says. \"Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America exploited a loophole\" in the curbs on executive pay \"to increase salaries by several hundred percent.\"\nThose increases are no aberration. Overall, Wall Street is on track to pay employees $144 billion this year, which would break a record for the second year in a row.\nREAD the full report below:\n}}

{{NEW YORK -- The announcement came in the middle of a General Assembly meeting early Friday morning at the Occupy Wall Street protest in Zuccotti Park, where thousands had gathered in anticipation of an attempt by the police to clear the site.\n\"We have breaking news,\" said the speaker. \"We can stay.\"\nHigh-fives, cheers. For hours, protesters had been bracing themselves for a showdown with the police and mass arrests. Now it looked like the encampment in Zuccotti Park would live to see another day.\nThe conflict between the company that owns the park and the protesters began on Tuesday, when Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield Properties, wrote a letter to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in which he requested police assistance in clearing the site. \"After weeks of occupation, conditions at the park have deteriorated to unsanitary and unsafe,\" Clark wrote.\nOn Wednesday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the protesters would have to temporarily leave the park to make way for sanitation workers, who would be cleaning the site later in the week. Workers had not cleaned up the park since the occupation began.\nThe protesters generally saw this as a pretext for kicking them out -- a point of view that gained traction on Thursday, when Kelly said they would not be allowed to return with their sleeping bags and other items. Many protesters vowed to resist eviction by forming a human chain around the site.\nIn the meantime, they took it upon themselves to show that outside sanitation help wouldn't be necessary. Grabbing brooms and filling up water buckets at local restaurants, they threw themselves into a frenzy of sweeping and tidying. A coalition of civil liberties lawyers supporting the protesters wrote a letter to Clark in which they insisted that the protesters had long been addressing his concern about cleanliness. The lawyers also offered to meet with the company.\nBefore dawn on Friday, protesters prepared for the arrival of the police and sanitation workers by warning one other about the possibility of mass arrests and by apprising one another of the presence of lawyers.\nAt around 6:30 a.m., the park was filled with people. A series of speakers rallied them for the confrontation everyone still believed was in store, and in what has become a Zuccotti Park tradition, the crowd repeated every few words each speaker said so that people on the outer edges could hear. In fact, the crowd was so big that every few words were repeated three or four times.\nThe news came first in waves of tentative talk \u2013 \"Did you see that tweet?\" \u2013 and finally with the big announcement, \"We can stay.\" In a press statement had made its way to a speaker at the General Assembly, a spokesperson for Brookfield Properties said that, for \"the time being,\" they were \"withdrawing their request from earlier in the week for police assistance during their cleaning operation.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Brookfield believes they can work out an arrangement with the protesters that will ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use and that the situation is respectful of residents and businesses downtown, and we will continue to monitor the situation.\"\nAfter the General Assembly adjourned, a group of protesters set off on a march down Broadway and according to some reports at least a dozen were arrested. Many others stayed in Zuccotti Park. Among them was Cecilia Blewer, 55, who had marched Wednesday with a group of parents and teachers. She picked up a broom and got back to sweeping. \"There's always work to be done,\" she said.\n}}

This may be the highest-velocity three-hour movie I\u2019ve ever seen, a delirious and borderline addictive wash of adrenaline, testosterone, and controlled substances.\nThe screenplay, by Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire) is a marvel of indecency, featuring hilarious set pieces regarding cousin marriage, Quaaludes, and the various grades of prostitute. DiCaprio is a mesmerizingly over-the-top slice of ham\u2014part motivational speaker (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia), part football coach (think Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday), and all sleaze. The supporting cast, which also features Jean Dujardin and Kyle Chandler, is uniformly terrific. Even Rob Reiner (who plays Belfort\u2019s dad) delivers big-screen excellence, for the first time on either side of the camera in longer than I care to remember.\nBut the true star of The Wolf of Wall Street is Martin Charles Scorsese, who at age 71 comes uncorked like a well-shaken bottle of vintage champagne. The movie plays like a master\u2019s course in cinematic technique delivered by the master himself, crammed with giddy effects and visual jokes. A crowd parts for DiCaprio as it did in Titanic, and there is a brilliantly naughty variation on the epochal \u201cMrs. Robinson, you\u2019re trying to seduce me\u201d shot from The Graduate. There are witty references, too, to The Equalizer, Tod Browning\u2019s Freaks, and Benihana. And don\u2019t get me started on the comic tour de force in which Popeye\u2019s spinach is analogized to\u2014no, you\u2019ll have to wait and see it for yourself.\n}}
{{The Occupy Wall Street movement should not exclude activism in electoral politics.\nIn the midst of the excitement around these massive and ever-growing protests against economic injustice, some individuals and groups have suggested that the activism represented by the movement is the only worthwhile kind.\nThe substance of the argument is that electoral activism is pointless. Such an argument, however, sends good progressives down a one-way street.\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement is a fabulous display of antipathy to economic injustice and the elites who feel that they can ignore the growing misery suffered by the U.S. public. It is an audacious stand against a class that has acted in vampire-like fashion to drain the blood from the rest of the country.\nYet it is a movement that must at some point confront the question: \u201cWhere to from here?\u2019\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss, out of hand, any participation in electoral policy. The Occupy Wall Street movement can serve as a mass base for multilevel social activism.\nOn the electoral front, it can energize a whole wave of left-of-center politicians who can capture the critical argument of these demonstrations and turn them into a platform. Much as the tea party movement did on the right, the Occupy Wall Street movement can bring forward good grassroots leaders as well as experienced politicians to challenge the retrograde politics and economics that has the United States stuck in an economic and moral quagmire.\nIn this sense, there is no contradiction between the activism in the streets, represented by the Occupy Wall Street movement, and the sort of electoral activism that is represented by groups like the Progressive Democrats of America, Virginia New Majority, Florida New Majority or the practice of elected leaders such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.\nOur political leaders must operate not as individuals aspiring to enter the political elite, but instead as champions of social and economic justice, or as a good friend recently said to me, as those who are prepared to challenge unjust authority.\nWhen we counterpose street-based activism to electoral activism we ultimately stall. Protest alone is not enough. It simply says what we do not like. Today, we have to fight to put people power in the hands of those who are being crushed by the economic juggernaut. The 99 percent should be in the streets and in Congress.\nBill Fletcher Jr. is a longtime racial justice, labor and international activist and writer.

{{Jordan Belfort and his partners, principally a guy named Danny Porush, bilked investors out of more than $200 million by tricking them into buying illiquid penny stocks that his firm was selling out of secret accounts. Belfort fancied himself \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which is the title of his memoir and of the Martin Scorsese-directed film, based on the book and starring Leonardo di Caprio as the Wall Street con man.\nIt's all a fiction. Belfort didn't work on Wall Street. His firm, Stratton Oakmont, named to sound like a venerable white shoe firm, started as a phone bank in the show room of an abandoned car lot in Queens. His scam, which amounts to \"you bought, we sold\" is among the oldest in the investment industry. It relies only on the persistence of fast talking salespeople, which Belfort and Porush assembled in abundance.\nBelfort is not even the first financier to use the Wolf of Wall Street sobriquet. That honor goes to David Lamar, a con artist so bold that he once disguised himself as a U.S. Senator in an attempt to deliver a floor speech that would drive down steel prices while he shorted the commodity. Lamar never really worked on Wall Street either.\nThe first time I spoke to Belfort on the phone in 2008 he insisted, \"It was not a pump and dump, it was stock manipulation.\"\nBelfort had been out of jail for almost six years at that point. Film rights to his memoir had been optioned by Scorcese. His book was a bestseller and a sequel was on the way. He did not like his crime compared to something that sounds like a colonic procedure. He insisted that he was a stock manipulator.\nEugene Fama just won the Nobel Prize for his work on efficient markets, the theory that, in its strongest form, says that the prices for stocks and other liquid securities reflect all available information at all times, rendering the markets immune to manipulation. Belfort claims for himself a kind of wizardry akin to controlling the weather.\nThis is Belfort's new pitch. He used to sell worthless stocks, now he sells himself. The story is that he is sober since 1998, that he is a reformed criminal who helped the Feds (ratting out his partners earned him a light prison sentence) and that he is now on Earth as a cautionary tale to other would-be thieves and the regulators and compliance people who must stop them. Also, he has great stories about abusing Quaaludes and having sex with beer models, which is how he entertained cellmate Tommy Chong, the comedian and bongwright who did time in federal prison alongside Belfort for the comparatively inconsequential crime of manufacturing pot smoking devices. It was Chong who convinced Belfort to tell his story.\nThe book is peppered with necessary contrition, but Belfort remains enamored of his crimes, of what he got away with and the lifestyle he used to lead with multiple mansions, disposable helicopters (he crashed one into his own front lawn) and disposable yachts (he ordered the captain to steer his chartered pleasure boat into a storm, destroying the vessel but somehow not getting anybody killed). The film will justify its voyeurism as one that casts a critical and disapproving eye on the greed and excess that fueled the fraud at Stratton Oakmont. But the result is the creation of Jordan Belfort as something of a lovable rake, akin to the thieves and manipulators that pepper the films of Guy Ritchie or the fiction of the late Elmore Leonard.\nBelfort and Porush are both still very wealthy \u2013 certainly in the top five percent of Americans by net worth (including real estate). Now, Belfort ratted out Porush, who ratted out some other people. It is said that the two no longer speak. Belfort served less than two years in prison. Porush served a bit less than four years. Porush still associates with the Stratton Oakmont crew. Belfort does not. Belfort now counts di Caprio and Chong among his friends. Belfort was the salesman. Porush maintains a lower profile. He is played by Jonah Hill in the movie but the character's name is Danny Azog.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street movie is not the first Stratton Oakmont inspired film. Boiler Room, starring Vin Diesel, was released in 2000 while Belfort and Porush was still in jail. Boiler Room was a less glitzy affair from the last gasps of the small 90s indie era that owed more to Glengarry Glenn Ross than Casino. Scorcese is bringing the full carnival to screen.\nBut I want to get back to the part about Belfort and Porush both still being rich, after all that's happened. Both were ordered to repay the $200 million bilked from investors. Belfort was ordered to devote half of his future earnings to that cause. The government seized and sold property from both men. Porush says that he's paid more than $11 million in restitution. The government has claimed that Belfort has not made good, though that is now in negotiations between the two.\nIt is improbable that these two men, or that any two people, would have amassed such fortunes in the first place. They did it criminally. They both went to jail. Then, somehow, they did it again. How likely is that, particularly with both devoting massive proportions of their future earnings to gestation?\nI first came across these guys when I was a reporter at Forbes. A few years before my time, Forbes exposed the Stratton Oakmont fraud (it took the government years more to catch up, which is understandable as the foundations of a criminal case must be far sturdier than those of an article). I knew how Belfort was when I received review galleys of The Wolf of Wall Street. I read it and assumed that some scrutiny would cause the book to break into A Million Little Pieces. I called people mentioned in the book. The big stuff checked out.\n\"It's all true!\" rasped Bo Dietl, the former NYPD officer turned celebrity detective and bodyguard who used to handle Belfort's security. \"I took him to Rao's and he was so stoned he fell asleep in his fucking macaroni!\"\nIt is a matter of public record that Belfort's firm led the initial public offering of Steve Madden Shoes because Madden, Belfort and Porush were all childhood friends. Through a representative, Madden confirmed that on the day of the IPO he made a tender speech to Stratton's stock brokers about the power of such a simple idea as the patent leather Mary Jane has over capital flows and the rise of America's great companies. The assembled brokers hooted and hollered as Stratton Oakmont crossed the Rubicon to bring a company public for the first time.\nCould a petty boiler room founded by a bunch of nobodies become an investment bank, like in the old days of Wall Street? The clue was in the reaction of the floor brokers to Madden's speech. \"Shut up, faggot!\" those monkeys screeched and hollered. Turns out that the whole offering was just another pump and dump, one that wound up with Madden serving jail time, too.\nI couldn't debunk the book but I could, at least, give it a bad review.\nBelfort trained himself as a writer by aping Tom Wolfe's style. An unfortunate side effect of that is that, in borrowing from Wolfe's novel I Am Charlotte Simmons, Belfort decided that he should repeatedly refer to the \"loins\" of his beer model girlfriend as \"loamy.\" Loam is a type of soil made of silt, sand and organic matter. If that girl had loamy loins, she needed a pump and dump.\nWhat really came through in the book was Belfort's fascination with his own crimes. He recounts all of his adventures but says nothing about his victims except to claim at the beginning of the book that they were all wealthy, sophisticated and should have known better only to walk back the claim in the latter pages. In Belfort's telling, Madden is the petty thief.\nBecause of the review, Nancy Porush, ex-wife (and cousin) to Danny Porush contacted me. She was working as a yoga instructor at a Long Island Equinox and suing Porush for child support payments that Porush said he couldn't make because he was broke, having worked only as a truck driver since leaving prison. His new wife had all the money and was the source of their $2 million country club condo in Boca Raton as well as the his and hers Bentley coupes that they drove.\nNancy had two claims. One, impossible to verify, was that Belfort and Porush were in fact in touch and that they had secreted some of their money away in the Bahamas. Danny was directing some former Stratton Oakmont brokers in how to repatriate the money by setting up a fake export business in chicken parts. Overvalued chicken parts go to a restaurant in Turks & Caicos, laundered money comes in. Unverifiable, of course, though I tried. The continued wealth of Belfort and Porush suggests something.\nThe other is that Porush had a new business, also involving former Stratton brokers. He was selling diabetic supplies to old people and then billing Medicare for it. That business is still operating. There are multiple companies involved with Porush acting as a consultant. Indirectly, the white-collar criminal is billing taxpayers.\nThe story now is that the bad actors were caught, paid for their crimes, have reformed and look back with regret. It doesn't pass the smell test. It looks like the bad guys are still getting away with it\u2014one by selling himself, the other using sick people as a way to get government money and both, maybe, dipping into secret money from the old days.\nThe movie looks like fun, though.\n}}
{{Wall Street closed narrowly mixed Monday after investors, uneasy about the government\u2019s upcoming inflation data, cashed in some of their gains from the market\u2019s months-long rally.\nMajor Market Indices\nBlue chip stocks managed a modest increase, thanks to DaimlerChrysler AG\u2019s announcement that it will sell 80.1 percent of money-losing Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management LP, a private equity group, for $7.4 billion. The deal, which lifted stocks in the automotive sector, undoes a 1998 merger aimed at creating a global auto giant.\nThe news buoyed the Dow Jones industrial average briefly to a new trading high, but the overall stock market dipped, with many investors wary ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of the Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation.\n\u201cPeople are waiting to get a better read on some of the pricing data,\u201d said Jack Caffrey, equities strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s a bit of a holding pattern.\u201d\nThe market expects the April CPI to have risen 0.5 percent, slower than in March, but it anticipates the core figure \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices \u2014 will increase 0.2 percent, a slightly larger jump than March\u2019s increase of 0.1 percent. Data indicating that consumer costs are rising much faster could frustrate investors hoping for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve later in the year.\nThe Dow finished with a gain of 20.56 points, or 0.15 percent, after rising in the morning to a trading record of 13,383.76. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gave up 2.70 points, or 0.18 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 15.78 points, or 0.62 percent.\nBonds fell slightly, as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of Tuesday\u2019s economic data, which will include the National Association of Home Builders\u2019 housing market index. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 4.69 percent from 4.68 percent late Friday.\nThe dollar was mixed against other major currencies; gold prices fell.\nDaimlerChrysler rose $2.12, or 2.6 percent, to $84.12. Other automakers advanced as well, boosted by the Chrysler deal: General Motors, one of the 30 Dow components, rose $1.16, or 3.9 percent, to $30.62. Ford Motor Co. rose 34 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $8.71.\nOther takeover news on Monday included Cardinal Health\u2019s agreement to buy Viasys Healthcare Inc. for $1.42 billion. Viasys rose $11.63, or 36.9 percent, to $43.18, and Cardinal Health rose 12 cents to $69.19.\nMerger-and-acquisition activity has played a big role in the stock market\u2019s surge over the past several months, as investors consider it a good sign that corporate America is faring well amid the nation\u2019s economic slowdown.\nBut caution ahead of Tuesday\u2019s data dampened Monday\u2019s takeover excitement. Tuesday will not only bring inflation and housing reports, but also quarterly financial results \u2014 notably from DaimlerChrysler, and Dow components Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc.\nLast week, same-store sales figures suggested that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, is waning. Wal-Mart reported Thursday that April\u2019s U.S. sales decline was its worst monthly slide since the world\u2019s largest retailer began reporting same-store sales results in 1980.\n\u201cI think right now the deals going on in the market are helping more than the consumer,\u201d said Neil Massa, equity trader at John Hancock Funds.\nThe stock market is not as dependent on a strong consumer as gross domestic product is, noted Caffrey. But any negative surprises going forward could cause a sell-off in stocks, considering how far they have climbed in such a short period of time. The Dow has hit 21 record closes since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cThe volatility should be higher than it has been. Ultimately, we think at year-end things will be higher than they are today, but there will be bumps along the way,\u201d Caffrey said.\nThe average U.S. retail gasoline price climbed to a record high of $3.07 a gallon, according to AAA, surpassing levels seen after Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf Coast.\nCrude oil rose 9 cents to $62.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nOverseas, Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock average rose 0.71 percent. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 lost 0.16 percent, Germany\u2019s DAX index dropped 0.26 percent and France\u2019s CAC-40 dipped 0.40 percent.\n}}
{{Over at the Wall Street Journal, the New York financial paper is absolutely in love with Dennis Herrera's bid for the top job at City Hall. Without going so far as to officially endorse Herrera, the paper paints our cuddly City Attorney as the quiet legal mastermind behind Newsom's famously in-your-face push for same-sex marriage. Despite Herrera's gay rights advocacy and tough stance on gang injunctions, what the paper really likes about his campaign is his completely un-confrontational style that \"lacks the hyperkinetic flash of Mr. Newsom and predecessor Willie Brown.\"\nActually if you had to go off of what the WSJ has to say about this year's election, you'd think the race only had four milquetoast candidates in it. The piece names \"quieter figures\" Michela Alioto-Pier, David Chiu and Leland Yee as Herrera's top rivals. While this obviously does a great disservice to the lovable, outspoken dark horse candidates like Harold Miller and Wilma Pang, what about Bevan Dufty? He's been so soft spoken lately that we almost forgot he was still running (and asking for more money). Surely an East Coast paper could get behind such a politely run campaign as his.\nAnyhow, we reached out to Herrera's camp to see how the City Attorney was taking all this newfound adoration from the Journal and he had this to say:\n'It's a new day in America when a liberal lawyer like myself who is noted for fighting for marriage equality is featured in the Wall Street Journal.\"\nNot exactly, \"whether you like it or not,\" but we'll take it.\n[WSJ]\n}}

A moment last Monday, just after noon, in Manhattan.... I'm in the 90s on Fifth heading south, enjoying the broad avenue, the trees, the wide cobblestone walkway that rings Central Park. Suddenly I realize: Something's odd here. Something's strange. It's quiet. I can hear each car go by. The traffic's not an indistinct roar. The sidewalks aren't full, as they normally are. It's like a holiday, but it's not, it's the middle of a business day in February. I thought back to two weeks before when a friend and I zoomed down Park Avenue at evening rush hour in what should have been bumper-to-bumper traffic. This is New York five months into hard times. One senses it, for the first time: a shift in energy. Something new has taken hold, a new air of peace, perhaps, or tentativeness.

Regardless, the disintermediation and disarray of hedge funds and fund of funds have a ways to go.\nA marginal buyer must emerge. Pension funds seem to be the likely marginal buyer as they reallocate out of fixed income into equities, but we have not yet seen the emergence of this trend. While sentiment and valuation are not the sine qua non in determining share prices, it should be underscored that the current bear market is the second-worst in history, both in terms of price decline and the erosion in P/E multiples. This means that embedded expectations are low. While sentiment, as measured by hedge fund and mutual fund redemptions, remains acutely negative, individual, sovereign and institutional liquidity remains abundant and is growing swiftly. On multiple fronts, equities appear to have incorporated the bad news and are undervalued both absolutely and relative to fixed income: On multiple fronts, equities appear to have incorporated the bad news and are undervalued both absolutely and relative to fixed income: The risk premium, the market's earnings yield less the risk-free rate of return, is substantially above the long-term average reading. Using reasonably conservative assumptions (most importantly, a near 50% peak-to-trough earnings decline, which is over 3x the drop in an average recession), the market has discounted 2009 S&P 500 earnings of about $47. Valuations are low vis-\u00e0-vis a decelerating (and near zero) rate of inflation. Indeed, the current market multiple is consistent with a 6% rate of inflation. Stock prices as a percentage of replacement book value stand at 1x, well below the 1.4x long-term average. The market capitalization of U.S. stocks vs. stated GDP has dropped dramatically, to about 80%, now at the long-term average. Warren Buffett was recently interviewed in Fortune Magazine and observed that this ratio was evidence that stocks have become attractive. The 10-year rolling annualized return of the S&P is at its lowest level in nearly 75 years, having recently broken below the levels achieved in the late 1930s and mid 1970s. A record percentage of companies have dividend yields that are greater than the yield on the 10-year U.S. note. At 46% of the companies, that is over 4x higher than in 2002 and compares against only 5% on average over the last 30 years. The most common cause of low prices is pessimism. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces. It's optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer. None of this means, however, that a business or stock is an intelligent purchase simply because it is unpopular; a contrarian approach is just as foolish as a follow-the-crowd strategy. What's required is thinking rather than polling. -- Warren Buffett Today's growing investor disaffection and apathy with regard to equities has, at it's root, Hunter S. Thompson's fear and loathing. Both have given voice to the mind-set of a generation that had held high ideals and, as it relates to stocks in 2009, is now crashing hard against the walls of American reality in credit and finance.

{{As Occupy Wall Street spread across the nation last fall, sparking protests in more than 70 cities, the Department of Homeland Security began keeping tabs on the movement. An internal DHS report entitled \u201cSPECIAL COVERAGE: Occupy Wall Street,\u201d dated October of last year, opens with the observation that \u201cmass gatherings associated with public protest movements can have disruptive effects on transportation, commercial, and government services, especially when staged in major metropolitan areas.\u201d While acknowledging the overwhelmingly peaceful nature of OWS, the report notes darkly that \u201clarge scale demonstrations also carry the potential for violence, presenting a significant challenge for law enforcement.\u201d\nThe five-page report \u2013 contained in 5 million newly leaked documents examined by Rolling Stone in an investigative partnership with WikiLeaks \u2013 goes on to sum up the history of Occupy Wall Street and assess its \u201cimpact\u201d on everything from financial services to government facilities. Many of the observations are benign, and appear to have been culled from publicly available sources. The report notes, for instance, that in Chicago \u201cfive women were arrested after dumping garbage taken from a foreclosed home owned by Bank of America in the lobby one of the bank\u2019s branches,\u201d and that \u201cOWS in New York staged a \u2018Millionaires March,\u2019 from Zucotti Park to demonstrate outside the homes of some of the city\u2019s richest residents.\u201d\nBut the DHS also appears to have scoured OWS-related Twitter feeds for much of their information. The report includes a special feature on what it calls Occupy\u2019s \u201csocial media and IT usage,\u201d and provides an interactive map of protests and gatherings nationwide \u2013 borrowed, improbably enough, from the lefty blog Daily Kos. \u201cSocial media and the organic emergence of online communities,\u201d the report notes, \u201chave driven the rapid expansion of the OWS movement.\u201d\nThe most ominous aspect of the report, however, comes in its final paragraph:\n\u201cThe growing support for the OWS movement has expanded the protests\u2019 impact and increased the potential for violence. While the peaceful nature of the protests has served so far to mitigate their impact, larger numbers and support from groups such as Anonymous substantially increase the risk for potential incidents and enhance the potential security risk to critical infrastructure (CI). The continued expansion of these protests also places an increasingly heavy burden on law enforcement and movement organizers to control protesters. As the primary target of the demonstrations, financial services stands the sector most impacted by the OWS protests. Due to the location of the protests in major metropolitan areas, heightened and continuous situational awareness for security personnel across all CI sectors is encouraged.\u201d\nIt\u2019s never a good thing to see a government agency talk in secret about the need to \u201ccontrol protestors\u201d \u2013 especially when that agency is charged with protecting the homeland against terrorists, not nonviolent demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights to peaceable dissent. From the notorious Cointelpro operations of the 1960s to the NYPD\u2019s recent surveillance of Muslim Americans, the government has a long and disturbing history of justifying the curtailing of civil liberties under the cover of perceived, and often manufactured, threats (\u201cthe potential security risk to critical infrastructure). What\u2019s more, there have been reports that Homeland Security played an active role in coordinating the nationwide crackdown on the Occupy movement last November \u2013 putting the federal government in the position of targeting its own citizens in the name of national security. There is not much of a bureaucratic leap, if history is any guide, between a seemingly benign call for \u201ccontinuous situational awareness\u201d and the onset of a covert and illegal campaign of domestic surveillance.\n}}
{{Online broker Web Street (Nasdaq: WEBS) goes public Wednesday with a reputation of catering to the hyperactive trader. Web Street will need every one of those traders to be a long-term hit on Wall Street.\nWeb Street priced its 3.5 million share offering at $11, the top of its $9 to $11 price range. Fahnestock & Co. is the lead underwriter with an assist from Pacific Crest. Neither underwriter is a powerhouse.\nAs for the timing, Web Street looks pretty good. Trading volume is up and some online brokers are back in favor on Wall Street. Web Street could definitely be a one-day wonder.\nAfter that first day though, investors may be the ones wondering about Web Street.\nWeb Street: Can it compete?\nFor the record, Web Street is a relatively solid brokerage and is ranked 15th among e-brokers, according to Gomez Advisors, an e-commerce research firm. In a review, Gomez said Web Street said is best suited for the hyperactive trader. That's not a bad niche considering there are a lot of hyperactive traders out there.\nBut Web Street's chances of big-time success are getting slimmer by the day. You could sum Web Street up in a word -- late. As in late to the game, late to go public and late to make the moves needed to compete.\nWeb Street had revenue of $17.1 million and a net loss of $3.9 million for the nine months ending Sept. 30. The company had $519 million in assets at the end of that period.\nFor reference, E*Trade (Nasdaq: EGRP) had $173 million in revenue for its most recent quarter. E*Trade's sales would have been higher if it wasn't aggressively marketing to the same hyperactive traders, also known as Web Street's core customers. E*Trade had more than 1.2 million active accounts compared to Web Street's 73,000 as of Sept. 30.\nUnfair comparison you say? Maybe, but size matters in this market as does distribution and scale.\nWeb Street said it plans to spend $24 million on marketing and brand building with the proceeds of its IPO, which is supposed to bring home about $31.3 million. That marketing budget isn't bad, but E*Trade will spend that amount in a quarter with ease. National Discount Brokers (Nasdaq: NDB) and the rest of the pack aren't far behind.\nIn addition, the online broker game is changing dramatically. It's not just about trading volume anymore. The game is about additional financials services, better IPO distribution and acquiring customer assets to smooth out the ups and downs. The online guys are also clashing with established firms such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch on the Web.\nJust this week, Ameritrade (Nasdaq: AMTD), Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCH) and TD Waterhouse (NYSE: TWE) said they were forming an online investment bank to gain access to IPO shares. Those three may have the clout to get shares, but Web Street doesn't even though it is a co-manager of its own IPO.\nHyperactive traders could leave Web Street to follow the IPOs.\nJust a few weeks before the Ameritrade, Schwab and Waterhouse deal, Wit Capital (Nasdaq: WITC) bought SoundView Technology to boost its holdings. Web Street won't have the capital or the stock currency to buy itself that kind of girth.\nWeb Street is also dependent on trading volume as more than half of its sales come via commissions. Volume is strong now, but fluctuates depending on the season.\n\"Our growth may depend in part on our strategy of providing other online financial services, including banking, consumer credit, home mortgage brokerage services, insurance and merchandise payment, as well as the online distribution of securities in public offerings led by established investment banking firms,\" said Web Street in regulatory filings. \"We may need to enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or other alliances to offer these additional financial services.\"\nAnd if Web Street can't diversify? It'll be bought by a competitor.\nNews and notes\nPriceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) is taking a hefty $1.1 billion charge and diluting shares to gain access to tickets from UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, US Airways Group Inc. and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines. Now Priceline has all the major airlines in its stable.\nSo will investors focus on the charge or the potential revenue growth? Go with the revenue. The real bottom line, which includes charges, died a while ago. Now it's all operating earnings and revenue growth.\nSchwab got SEC approval to allow investors to view IPO roadshows on the Internet. Schwab, however, is limiting the roadshows to only its richest customers. Although the average trader may be left out, times are changing. In the near future, IPO roadshows may be viewed as commonly as earnings webcasts.\nThe Nasdaq is apparently struggling with volume just like the online brokers. A software upgrade attempt wiped out trading late yesterday. One question lingers: Why try to upgrade the software when trading was still in session?\n}}

{{The Wall Street Journal\u2019s main Hugo Chavez antagonist is its self-styled Latin American \u201cexpert\u201d Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady who makes up for in imagination and vitriol what she lacks in knowledge and journalistic integrity. She, however, wasn\u2019t assigned to write the May 1 Journal attack piece reporters David Luhnow in Mexico City and Peter Millard in Caracas got to do titled \u201cHow Chavez Aims to Weaken US.\u201d Of course, when it comes to Venezuela, the issue is oil and Chavez\u2019s having the \u201caudacity\u201d to want his people to benefit most from their own resources, not predatory foreign oil companies the way it used to be when the country\u2019s leadership only served the interests of capital ignoring essential social needs. No longer.\nChavez, of course, announced months ago his government would complete renationalizating his country\u2019s oil reserves when state oil company PDVSA became the majority shareholder May 1 in four Orinoco River basin oil projects with a minimum 60% ownership in joint ventures with foreign partners. The plan was broadly denounced in the US major media with Journal columnist O\u2019Grady writing April 16 \u201cChavez (was) brimming with bravado as he shredded (the) oil contracts (telling) foreigners to step aside because he\u2019s in charge now (but the move will likely) end up hitting the \u2018commandante of the revolution\u2019 in the pocketbook (because of) corruption, incompetence and mismanagement\u201d meaning Venezuela will now run all its own oil operations and forge its own future, not Big Oil O\u2019Grady wants sole right to do it. No longer indeed, and O\u2019Grady\u2019s not pleased. She\u2019s also dead wrong in her outlook for Venezuela\u2019s oil future run by PDVSA with foreign partners, but don\u2019t ever expect her to admit it.\nSo is the New York Times agreeing April 10 with O\u2019Grady and other corporate media Big Oil cheerleaders. The Times used charged language condemning Chavez\u2019s \u201crevolutionary flourish (and his) ambitious (plan to) wrest control of several major oil projects from American and European companies (with a) showdown (ahead for these) coveted energy resources\u2026.\u201d The Times went on to claim this action would undermine Venezuela\u2019s growth hinting Big Oil\u2019s threat to leave might get Chavez to back down enough to get them to stay. It never happened as this writer suggested April 12 in an article titled \u201cWall Street Journal and New York Times Attack journalism.\u201d The article made it clear oil exploration and production in Venezuela is so profitable that even with a smaller share of the profits US, European and other Big Oil investors wouldn\u2019t dream of leaving. Whine plenty, leave, not likely, and now we know they won\u2019t.\nAP\u2019s Natalie Obiko Pearson reported April 26 that \u201cFour major oil companies (stopped whining April 25 and) agreed to cede control of Venezuela\u2019s last remaining (majority-owned) privately run oil projects to President Hugo Chavez\u2019s government\u201d with ConocoPhillips coming around May 1 showing it, too, was all bark and no bite. Those agreeing through signed memorandums of understanding were Chevron, BP(Amoco) PLC, France\u2019s Total SA, Norway\u2019s Statoil ASA, ConocoPhillips, and with most antagonistic of all to the idea ExxonMobil finally doing it privately as was almost certain to happen and then did.\nAP reported ConocoPhillips has the most Orinoco basin exposure in two of four projects, Ameriven and Petrozuata with a (former) 50.1% stake in the latter. It was inconceivable the company would abandon them, and on May 1 it announced it would stay on. The one remaining issue to be resolved is compensation with foreign investors having until June 26 to negotiate terms for their reduced stakes. Expect more Big Oil whining followed by capitulation again to Venezuelan Energy Ministry\u2019s expected offer of fair and equitable takeover terms.\nOn April 26, PDVSA\u2019s web site reported a total of 10 foreign oil companies agreed to transfer majority control of their \u201cOil Belt\u201d operations to the state-run oil company. Further, the company expects to achieve a daily capacity of 5.85 million barrels in 2012 and said its January 1 taking control of 32 oil fields will advance the country \u201ctoward full national sovereignty over (its) natural energy reserves.\u201d\nIn response to these actions, and on the day it took effect, the Journal went on the attack again with more ahead certain to be as false and misleading. Its writers called Chavez a \u201cself-proclaimed Maoist (wanting to) reshape the global oil business by sidelining the US and making China his country\u2019s chief strategic energy partner\u201d for investment and export. The Journal also accused Chavez of using \u201coil as a political weapon\u201d since taking office in 1999 offering discounted oil \u201cto dozens of Latin American countries\u201d as his weapon of choice plus forging alliances with US \u201ceconomic rivals like China and political rivals like Iran.\u201d\nHugo Chavez, in fact, is a self-proclaimed social democrat charting his own independent course toward progressive \u201c21st century socialism\u201d along the lines Latin American expert James Petras calls the \u201cpragmatic left\u201d in contrast to the more \u201cradical left\u201d of Colombia\u2019s FARC guerrillas; elements of \u201cteachers and peasant-indigenous movements in Oaxaca, Guerrero and Chiapas in Mexico;\u201d many \u201csmall Marxist groups in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and elsewhere;\u201d and Venezuela\u2019s \u201cpeasant and barrio movements,\u201d among others. Other Latin American leaders Petras calls \u201cpragmatic\u201d leftists include Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales, Cuba\u2019s Castro and many \u201clarge electoral parties and major peasant and trade unions in Central and South America\u201d including Mexico\u2019s PRD party, El Salvador\u2019s FMLN, Chile\u2019s Communist Party, \u201cthe majority in Peruvian (Ollanta) Humala\u2019s parliamentary party;\u201d and others including \u201cthe great majority of left Latin American intellectuals.\u201d\nUnlike what the Wall Street Journal and rest of the US corporate media report or imply, Chavez and others on the \u201cpragmatic left\u201d aren\u2019t aiming to destroy capitalism, just tame it. They also plan no wholesale renunciation of accumulated IMF, World Bank and other international lending agency debt, only calling for it to be on more equitable terms; restructuring it to make their nations\u2019 debt burden fair; and aiming to become free from its repressive yoke as Venezuela did paying it off completely with Chavez announcing May 1 his country is pulling out of the IMF and World Bank, formally breaking free from the kind of debt slavery these institutions impose on countries they lend to guaranteeing their people continued impoverishment.\nIt\u2019s an important move that may encourage other countries to follow as Ecuador\u2019s President Raphael Correa already did ousting the country\u2019s World Bank representative saying \u201cwe will not stand for extortion by this international bureaucracy.\u201d Look for more IMF-World Bank resentment to surface ahead as Chavez\u2019s and Correa\u2019s courage may embolden other leaders to move in the same direction or at least begin by openly voicing public discontent as a first step to possible policy change to follow.\nHugo Chavez offers them a new choice having announced in March he intends creating a Bank of the South social democratic alternative to the repressive neoliberal Washington Consensus IMF-World Bank model. So far Bolivia and Argentina have agreed to be part of it with Chavez hoping other Latin countries will join as well by contributing 10% of their capital reserves for this enterprise he hopes will be operating by summer.\nAdditional parts of Chavez\u2019s plan involve forging stronger ties to other oil importing nations like China to reduce Venezuela\u2019s dependency on a hostile US. He also announced April 29 the nation hopes to gradually sell its seven US-based Citgo refineries replacing them with a new Latin American-based network in Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Haiti and Dominica. It\u2019s part of his plan to provide the region a stable oil supply and 100% of the energy needs for Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) members and Haiti.\nHe further offers discounted oil to Latin American and other nations, not to buy support as the Journal claims, but to build progressive ALBA trade and other good neighbor alliances with regional nations the opposite of WTO-style Global North exploitive one-way deals. The Fifth ALBA Summit held in Barquisimeto, Venezuela just ended April 29 at which heads of state from Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti signed strategic ALBA agreements with delegations from Ecuador, Uruguay, Dominique and St. Vincent and the Grenadines also attending along with social movements from other states.\nChavez aims for more than just fair and equitable trade and other commercial, industrial and energy deals, and Summit leaders made progress toward them. They agreed to alliances in ALBA Education, Health, Culture, Food, and Telecommunications that may ahead extend Venezuela\u2019s and Cuba\u2019s social agenda to other ALBA countries and Haiti.\nThe May 1 Wall Street Journal article says \u201cChavez wants to replace the US as Venezuela\u2019s main partner and client in the oil business (and) The big winner could be (big, bad US rival) China\u201d that spells bad news for Washington and Big Oil. It continued saying the country has the largest proved reserves outside the Middle East, and if Chavez succeeds he\u2019ll force the US to be even more dependent on that volatile region than it already is. Further, Journal writers take aim at PDVSA demeaning it as a state-run company claiming it has \u201clittle focus\u201d because Chavez turned it into a \u201cpoverty-alleviation ministry.\u201d As a result, the Journal says it became inefficient and its production fell from 3.1 million barrels a day when Chavez first took office in 1999 to 2.4 million barrels a day now according to US government Energy Information Administration (EIA) figures that look to have been cooked to bring them down.\nThey\u2019re disputable with differing ones coming from alternate sources including the 2006 CIA World Factbook listing Venezuela\u2019s daily production at slightly under 3.1 million daily barrels, around the same figure PDVSA reported then including extra-heavy crude from Orinoco belt production. In May, 2006, Venezuelan Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Raphael Ramirez indicated the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognized the nation\u2019s daily oil production at over 3 million daily barrels while the government reports it now at 3.3 million compared to 2.6 million or less claimed by international oil analysts and EIA deliberately understating oil output the way Washington and the West distort everything positive about Venezuela under Hugo Chavez.\nThe Bush administration and US corporate media, flacking for Big Oil, is all over Hugo Chavez with the Journal\u2019s May Day article staying true to form. It ends saying Venezuela \u201cwas historically one of the US\u2019s most reliable energy allies\u201d pumping all out to guarantee America a steady supply when it was most needed as it did in WW II, the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the 1991 Gulf war. It then blamed Chavez for changing that instead of reporting Washington was at fault for soured relations that hit rock bottom during the aborted two-day April, 2002 coup against him the Journal can\u2019t admit the US instigated and supported.\nAll it can say, with a heavy-handed dose of sour grapes, is that \u201cMixing oil and politics may not help Mr. Chavez in the long run\u201d as he\u2019ll need \u201cprivate companies\u2019 expertise to develop the heavy crude in the Orinoco region\u201d without ever conceding he already has it and a long line of takers ready to step in if any now there foolishly leave. They won\u2019t, but don\u2019t expect to see that opinion reported anywhere in the Wall Street Journal as they\u2019d then have to admit everything they wrote earlier was false and misleading.

{{With an assortment of wall-mounted fauna peering down, the National Association of Securities Dealers threw a luncheon at the 21 Club to ballyhoo the 1,000th firm listed on the NASDAQ National Market System.\nThe advertising firm of Ogilvy & Mather International drew the honor, but the occasion was used to highlight the globalization of the markets and NASDAQ's increasingly competitive posture.\n''We have 288 foreign issues on NASDAQ already, the largest number of foreign issues on a major US equity market,'' said NASD president Gordon S. Macklin. This is up from 208 foreign listings in 1980, and compares to 96 on the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, according to Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad.\nIn terms of share volume, ''NASDAQ has become the third largest continuous-transaction reporting market (in the world),'' said Mr. Shad.\nThe Big Board still handles some 86 percent of the listed equity trading in the US. Some observers say the NYSE has passively watched as this over-the-counter upstart has grown. Nonetheless, there are signs that the NYSE is indeed aware of the challenge to attract firms here and abroad.\nThe exchange plans to review the restrictions placed on listed companies this week, according to a Wall Street Journal article on Tuesday. Analysts speculate the listing requirements may be loosened to give the NYSE a more competitive edge. The London exchange is taking similar steps. At the luncheon, Mr. Shad said London is headed toward abolishing fixed commissions and allowing more foreign investment.\nAnd last week it was announced that for the first time in the NYSE's 192-year history it will be open on election day. The move, said Mr. Shad, is recognition of a broader world market.\nThe rise of the NASDAQ National Market System (NMS) has been carefully orchestrated. In 1975, Congress mandated that the SEC move toward a automated central market system. Many saw the already computerized NASDAQ as a natural starting point. But it wasn't until April 1982 that a real-time computer trading system, the NMS, began. Theoretically, the NMS will eventually add AMEX and NYSE listed stocks to the over-the-counter issues now traded.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON -- Democrats on Wednesday raged against a government funding bill that would provide taxpayer subsidies to risky Wall Street derivatives trading.\n\"The House of Representatives is about to show us the worst of government for the rich and powerful,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the Senate floor. She urged her colleagues not to support a \"deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system.\"\nNews of the deal, first reported by HuffPost on Monday, has prompted a bitter bicameral feud. The dispute highlights a major divide among Democrats leading up to the 2016 elections over Wall Street's role in the party platform.\n\"[It's] an awful invitation for another financial disaster,\" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, told reporters Wednesday. \"A number of us are very concerned.\"\nWith Senate Democrats having already largely agreed to the House package, the only viable route Democrats have to strip the provision is in the House, where dozens of Republicans plan to oppose the package, meaning GOP leadership needs Democratic votes to approve it. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been pushing her caucus hard to stand strong against it and another provision that would increase the role of big money in campaigns. \"The public awareness among our base is very high on this swap and on this money,\" Pelosi told her whip team at a private meeting Thursday morning, sources told HuffPost. \"And all of the idealism that people have who support us \u2013 both as small donors and as major supporters \u2013 has always been about reducing the role of money in politics.\"\nThe swap provision she references would allow Wall Street banks to trade risky financial derivatives from subsidiaries that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- potentially putting taxpayers on the hook for losses. Big banks traded derivatives from these FDIC-backed units in the years leading up to the 2008 crash, but the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law required them to move many of the transactions to other subsidiaries that are not insured by taxpayers. Banks receive higher credit ratings for derivatives they sell from taxpayer-backed units, which in turn makes the derivatives more profitable.\n\u201cIf Congress repeals this regulation of dangerous over-the-counter derivatives and swaps, the U.S. economy will be vulnerable to the same kind of financial risks that triggered the Great Recession,\" warned Joseph E. Stiglitz, chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute and a Nobel Laureate, in a press release.\nThe provision was inserted in a $1 trillion omnibus spending package as a result of an agreement negotiated with House Republicans by Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). Mikulski originally cut the deal to include the derivatives language in exchange for a 16 percent increase in funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency responsible for overseeing the derivatives market.\nCongress needs to agree to a funding package by 11:59 pm Thursday, or the government will shut down. Prior to Monday, the most vocal opposition to a long-term spending agreement had come from conservative Republicans, who are angry with GOP leadership for failing to at least attempt to defund President Barack Obama's executive order shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Influential conservative groups, including the Club For Growth and Heritage Action, have officially voiced opposition to the so-called cromnibus bill.\nBut now, many infuriated Democrats are calling to kill the deal negotiated by House and Senate leadership. The office of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has led the behind-the-scenes opposition to the Wall Street provision along with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), called the funding deal if a \"Wall Street giveaway.\" Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tweeted his opposition Tuesday afternoon.\nThe #CROmnibus is a bad deal for working families, allows bad Wall Street deals, empowers wealthy donors, puts DHS in crisis. I'm opposed. \u2014 Keith Ellison (@keithellison) December 10, 2014\nRep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, ripped the cromnibus for \"rolling back regulations on risky behavior by big banks \u2013 the same sort of behavior that triggered the Great Recession.\"\n\"This so-called \u2018negotiation\u2019 is not enough. It does not serve the American people or this institution,\u201d Slaughter said.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) isn't taking sides in the fight, which on the Senate side is largely between factions led by Warren and Mikulski.\nOn the Senate floor, Warren urged House Democrats to oppose the pact unless the Wall Street provision was stripped out. A few hours later, she upped the ante, holding a press conference with Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, where both decried the provision as a \"Wall Street giveaway.\"\n\"I understand compromise. I believe in compromise,\" Warren said. \"This isn't about compromise. This is about reckless behavior. It is about a giveaway to the largest financial institutions in the country.\"\nWarren repeatedly declined, however, to say whether she would use her power under Senate rules to hold up the bill if the House passed it in its current form.\n\"Right now the fight is in the House -- that's the fight we are going to pursue,\" Warren said. \"It is up to the House to strip this out. That's what keeps the government operating, that's what keeps a compromise omnibus bill moving forward without endangering the American taxpayer.\"\nSpeaking to reporters, Waters questioned how Mikulski had allowed the provision to be tucked into the omnibus package. Although she said she did not know the details of the negotiations, Waters said it was \"unconscionable\" to slip in the pro-Wall Street rider.\n\"This deal just does not make good sense,\" Waters said. \"So we're here to say, we're not going to support the omnibus bill ... and we're going to spend every waking hour trying to pull this out of the omnibus bill.\"\n\"Oh let's keep the Wall Street casino alive and well!\" jeered Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) on a conference call Tuesday afternoon. Like Warren, Merkley stopped short of saying he would oppose the cromnibus if it included the Wall Street subsidy language, but said, \"I'm certainly entertaining that possibility.\"\nOn the same call, former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) called the deal \"absolutely outrageous,\" and said the budget deal sets a precedent that will allow Republicans to unravel the 2010 financial reform bill with every government funding agreement. Frank also argued that the provision could easily be taken out in the Senate if the House fails to remove it.\n\"If you vote this down, it would literally take about an hour to take it out,\" Frank said.\nIn other words, the entirety of congressional Democrats' financial policy brain trust is in revolt. And Warren's aggressive position signals a dramatic shift in the party's public messaging. Senate Democrats granted her a new leadership post as a policy adviser less than a month ago, and banking reform is Warren's signature issue.\nAs a shutdown looms in less than 36 hours, Democrats, oddly, have the most leverage over talks in the GOP-controlled House, where opposition from conservative hard-liners is expected to force House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to cultivate votes from across the aisle. Some critics, including Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), have explicitly cited the Wall Street language in voicing their opposition.\n\"The Wall Street subsidy is one of many reasons I am voting against this bill,\" Jones told HuffPost in a written statement. \"Once again, the House will be voting on a 1,603 page bill without having adequate time to read it -- we can\u2019t even come close to knowing everything in this $1.1 trillion bill in this timeframe.\"\nPelosi has publicly criticized the pro-Wall Street language, but banking reform advocates say she has effectively been waving the provision through by allowing rank-and-file Democrats to support it.\n}}
{{Stocks edged slightly lower Friday in very light New Year\u2019s Eve trading, but the overall stock market closed the year 2004 with solid gains, chalking up a second straight positive year for Wall Street.\nMajor Market Indices\nWith no new economic data and little corporate news, stocks drifted narrowly in and out of positive territory throughout the session. Despite the day\u2019s uncertain trading, the markets are expected to extend their yearend rally into January, if not further.\nThe fourth-quarter surge in the markets \u2014 moving from 2004 lows in October to 3\u00bd-year highs over the past two weeks \u2014 salvaged the markets\u2019 returns for the year. While the year\u2019s gains paled in comparison to 2003\u2019s double-digit returns, the post-election rally pushed the major indexes to high single-digit returns.\n\u201cWhen you look at it, it\u2019s astounding to get the kind of performance we had this year when you think about the negative effects of the bubble bursting from the \u201990s, the various corporate shenanigans we had, the rise in energy prices,\u201d said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Co. \u201cThe year\u2019s been very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the second year of an economic recovery, and the growth we\u2019ve seen is pretty good, all things considered.\u201d\nThe Dow Jones industrial average finished Friday\u2019s session down 17 points, or 0.2 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was off 2 points, or 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3 points, or 0.1 percent.\nFor the year, the Dow rose 3 percent, while the S&P 500 index added 9 percent. The Nasdaq composite also gained 9 percent.\nStocks entered 2004 riding a strong wave from the previous year, which saw the Dow rise 25 percent and the Nadsaq climb 50 percent. But a mid-year economic slowdown pushed stocks lower, and the slump was exacerbated by sharply rising oil prices in the third quarter. On Oct. 25, the Dow reached its low for the year at 9,749.99 before a post-election rally took hold.\nThis year\u2019s returns were even more welcome considering the sharp rise in crude oil prices, which topped $55 per barrel in October before falling through November and December. Crude futures closed Thursday at $43.45 per barrel, down 19 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was closed Friday.\nFor the year ahead, economic growth will likely continue at a calmer pace, while the falling dollar, which does raise long-term concerns regarding inflation, could actually help decrease the nation\u2019s trade deficit, boosting manufacturing stocks.\n\u201cI think the key issue is going to be, has the dollar fallen enough to generate trade improvement?\u201d William Dudley, chief U.S. economist for Goldman Sachs, told Associated Press Television News. \u201cIf the answer is no, that mean that economy will be a little bit softer, and the dollar will probably weaken a little bit further. If the answer is yes, then the economy will be stronger.\u201d\nPharmaceutical stocks were one of the few areas of focus Friday. According to media reports, Eli Lilly & Co. hid reports that its popular antidepressant Prozac could cause behavioral problems. Eli Lilly dropped 73 cents to $56.77 on the news.\nEmbattled drug maker Pfizer Inc. received good news from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved its drug Lyrica for neuropathic pain. Nonetheless, Pfizer was down 6 cents at $26.95.\nGeneral Electric Co. added 3 cents to $36.63 after it reiterated its previous earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and 2004. The conglomerate also said it completed a deal to sell its international capital financing division for $500 million. GE retains a 40 percent stake in the division.\nOverseas, markets in Japan and Germany were closed for the holiday, while Britain and France ended their sessions early. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 0.12 percent and France\u2019s CAC-40 fell 0.18 percent.\n}}
{{In rating shares of Apple, analyst Brian J. White of Ticonderoga Securities could justifiably be unnerved by the example of Microsoft at the end of 1999 as the tech boom neared its peak. The software giant was then the world\u2019s biggest technology outfit by market value: $607 billion, still the record for any company. Then came the tech crash. Since the turn of the decade, Microsoft has lost more than half its value.\nThese days, Apple is worth about $375 billion, with shares up about 25 percent, to $403, this year. If the stock gains an additional 12 percent, Apple will have the world\u2019s largest market value, surpassing ExxonMobil. Yet White isn\u2019t worried about Apple\u2019s abruptly coming down to earth. If anything, he and a handful of other analysts think Apple watchers on Wall Street may be substantially underestimating the potential of the company, which still only has a single-digit market share in mobile phones and personal computers. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a company of this size growing at this pace,\u201d says White, who recommends the stock and predicts it could be worth $617 billion within a year \u2014 the Street\u2019s highest target. \u201cWe can\u2019t even model out some of the possibilities: an Apple TV set, huge growth in China, businesses racing to buy Apple laptops. It\u2019s like a religion. It sounds crazy, but it could still be early for Apple.\u201d\nWall Street has had trouble getting a read on the prospects of the Cupertino, Calif., tech wonder for some time. In fairness, Apple\u2019s management is notorious for lowballing financial projections. Even so, Apple\u2019s profit has topped analysts\u2019 average forecasts for 25 straight quarters, according to Bloomberg data.\nThroughout this period, while Apple shares have soared higher, they\u2019ve become cheaper in relation to earnings. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s profit, seemingly defying the law of large numbers, keeps growing faster than the share price. Apple hasn\u2019t so much \u201cbeat the Street\u201d as humiliated it. \u201cThere\u2019s simply never been another large company growing at this rate,\u201d says Eric M. Jackson, managing member of Ironfire Capital, a hedge fund in Naples, Fla., that owns Apple shares. \u201cWe look at today\u2019s stocks through the lenses and biases of our past.\u201d\nDoubling profit\nApple, he says, is unique. It is on pace to report revenue of more than $100 billion this year \u2014 roughly what Microsoft and Intel take in combined. Profit is expected nearly to double, to $27 billion. The company is also throwing off greater amounts of cash \u2014 its $76 billion kitty could buy Hewlett-Packard or a combination of Netflix and EBay. Jackson says that when Apple hit a $250 billion valuation, hedge fund managers and analysts warned him that this was the upper limit. A few months later, Apple was worth $300 billion, and now $375 billion. Jackson sees Steve Jobs & Co. expanding into mobile payments, perhaps by buying a credit-card company outright.\nAnd so widens the disconnect: Apple just had its best quarter ever, posting sales of $28.57 billion, compared with Wall Street\u2019s consensus view of $25 billion, with earnings per share of $7.79, fully a third higher than expectations. The 20 million iPhones the company sold topped predictions of 17 million.\nEven as Apple\u2019s stock jumped in reaction, adding $25 billion in market value, its price-earnings ratio didn\u2019t. White, of New York-based Ticonderoga, calculates that Apple, excluding cash, changes hands for 10 times expected 2011 earnings, compared with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index\u2019s p-e of 14 (even as Apple is boosting earnings at six times the rate of the broader market). At the same time, Apple sports a decade-low p-e on the next 12 months\u2019 earnings.\nApple skeptics \u2014 yes, they exist \u2014 see challenges ahead. Apple\u2019s revenue opportunity in China, with its projected 125 million high-end smartphone subscribers, could be worth $70 billion, says White. Right now it\u2019s kicking in only about $4 billion a quarter. While Jackson and White believe that sum will multiply, Libin Lu, an analyst who covers Apple for Analysys International in Beijing, isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cThe ecosystem of Apple is a highly closed one,\u201d he says, contrasting it with Google\u2018s open Android mobile operating system, which now has the highest growth rate in the world and is gaining ground in China. \u201cIf they\u2019re still the same way in two or three years from now in China, Apple will not win.\u201d\nStingy with cash\nOther investors protest Apple\u2019s stinginess with its cash hoard, which works out to about $81 per share. The company has yet to return any of it to shareholders or use it to make a major acquisition. \u201cI would not buy Apple for clients, but not because of market cap or valuation,\u201d says Jenny Van Leeuwen Harrington, chief executive officer of Gilman Hill Asset Management in Westport, Conn. \u201cThey can and should be paying a dividend.\u201d\nApple optimists remain undeterred. If Apple keeps it up, the company will soon have a shot at breaking Microsoft\u2019s record tech company valuation. Then, says White, $1 trillion isn\u2019t so absurd. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he says. \u201cApple is an industry, not a company.\u201d\nThe bottom line: Apple\u2019s expected doubling of profit and its share performance have cast an unflattering light on Wall Street\u2019s projections for the company.\n}}
{{For years, the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell touted the achievements of its partner Jay Clayton in a lengthy biography displayed on its website. Clayton, one of the most powerful attorneys on Wall Street, had worked on everything from the sale of the Atlanta Hawks to Goldman Sachs\u2019 bailout to mortgage fraud settlements with several major financial institutions.\nBut then President Donald Trump nominated Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency tasked with policing Wall Street misconduct. Clayton\u2019s bio all but disappeared from the Sullivan & Cromwell site \u2015 trimmed from more than 800 words to less than 30.\nIt\u2019s perfectly legal for a Wall Street lawyer to join the SEC. But Clayton\u2019s relationship with the firm has raised questions about the agency\u2019s ability to crack down on securities fraud. At his confirmation hearing last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) noted that government ethics rules would bar Clayton from participating in any enforcement activity against a company that he previously represented as a lawyer \u2015 or any company that chose to be represented by Sullivan & Cromwell in a future dispute with the SEC. The restrictions would last for the first two years of Clayton\u2019s term as SEC chairman.\nWhen the agency\u2019s career staffers have investigated misconduct, its leaders \u2015 four commissioners and the chairman \u2015 vote on whether to issue fines or penalties. The commissioners are split evenly between Democrats and Republicans and often vote along partisan lines, resulting in a 2-2 tie, which is broken by the chair.\nIf Clayton is forced to sit out an enforcement decision, the result could be a deadlock that allows fraud to go unpunished. Like Clayton, President Barack Obama\u2019s SEC chair Mary Jo White had previously worked as a prominent corporate attorney before joining the regulator.

{{They were so willing, and had such an appetite, that Wall Street helped hedge funds construct specially engineered products to sell to them, made of the most broken and risky subprime mortgages. These products\u2014the banks called them \u201cmonstrosities\u201d and later the media dubbed them as \u201crigged to fail\u201d\u2014only would have been created if they had reckless buyers, and the European banks were often those buyers.\nWhen a bank buys an asset it is lending money; the seller is the borrower. In buying various assets European banks were doing what banks are supposed to do: lending. But by doing so without caution they were doing exactly what banks are not supposed to do: lending recklessly.\nThe European banks weren\u2019t lending recklessly to only the U.S. They were also aggressively lending within Europe, including to the governments of Spain, Portugal, and Greece.\nIn 2008, when the U.S. housing market collapsed, the European banks lost big. They mostly absorbed those losses and focused their attention on Europe, where they kept lending to governments\u2014meaning buying those countries\u2019 debt\u2014even though that was looking like an increasingly foolish thing to do: Many of the southern countries were starting to show worrying signs.\nBy 2010 one of those countries\u2014Greece\u2014could no longer pay its bills. Over the prior decade Greece had built up massive debt, a result of too many people buying too many things, too few Greeks paying too few taxes, and too many promises made by too many corrupt politicians, all wrapped in questionable accounting. Yet despite clear problems, bankers had been eagerly lending to Greece all along.\nThat 2010 Greek crisis was temporarily muzzled by an international bailout, which imposed on Greece severe spending constraints. This bailout gave Greece no debt relief, instead lending them more money to help pay off their old loans, allowing the banks to walk away with few losses. It was a bailout of the banks in everything but name.\nGreece has struggled immensely since then, with an economic collapse of historic proportion, the human costs of which can only be roughly understood. Greece needed another bailout in 2012, and yet again this week.\nWhile the Greeks have suffered, the northern banks have yet to account financially, legally, or ethically, for their reckless decisions. Further, by bailing out the banks in 2010, rather than Greece, the politicians transferred any future losses from Greece to the European public. It was a bait-and-switch rife with a nationalist sentiment that has corrupted the dialogue since: Don\u2019t look at our reckless banks; look at their reckless borrowing.\n* * *\nThe European Union started with an economic agreement on coal and steel and good intentions. It was, at least in part, an attempt to diminish through shared economic incentives the nationalism that had led to past wars.\n}}
{{Despite flat user numbers and a nominal beat in revenue, Twitter\u2019s fortune-reversal over the past several months is still going as the company said it actually posted a GAAP net income \u2014 sending the stock jumping more than 15%.\nTwitter\u2019s overall user numbers were flat, but the company was still able to post a surprising profit and fell above what Wall Street expected for its fourth-quarter earnings. While the company has had to constantly face down issues with the service\u2019s usability and problems that may keep new people from coming on, a lot of attention is now on its ability to try to figure out how to best capitalize on those users, such as by going after live video.\nHere\u2019s the slash line:\nQ4 revenue : $731.6 million, compared to $686.1 million expected by Wall Street. (Up 2% year- aover-year)\n: $731.6 million, compared to $686.1 million expected by Wall Street.

Year-over-year DAU growth : 12%\n: 12% Q4 Advertising revenue: $644 million\nSo there\u2019s a couple things happening here, but it\u2019s both that GAAP profitability and a surprising return to revenue growth that seems to looks very good here. And, naturally, nice surprises and money look good to Wall Street. Here\u2019s the chart for the company\u2019s stock, including today\u2019s huge jump:\nTwitter likes to (frustratingly) hand over that \u201cyear-over-year DAU growth percentage\u201d metric as tries to distance itself from the MAU as a core metric \u2014 which is one that has hounded Twitter for a number of reasons. But in recent months the company has made moves to curb harassment and has made at least some product changes, like expanding a Tweet\u2019s character count to a maximum of 280 characters.\nA whole lot happened since Twitter last reported its earnings. The company has been revising up the number of people it says interacted with Twitter accounts linked to propaganda efforts by a Russian government-linked organization. It also lost Anthony Noto, its chief operating officer who did a lot to help Twitter get into video, to SoFi. So, in very Twitter fashion, things are not ever particularly quiet over there.\nBut the company also ended 2017 on a very strong run, and even ended up with roughly the same market cap as Snap thanks to a sharp decline in their stock. That decline definitely reversed itself yesterday when Snap reported strong earnings, but thanks to a small-ish blessing from Wall Street and doing at least some stuff in 2017, the company was on track to finish up by around 25%.\n}}

{{President Donald Trump listens to questions from the media after speaking with members of the military by video conference on Christmas Day, Tuesday, Dec. 25, 2018, in the Oval Office of the White House.\nCharacteristically, President Donald Trump responded to bad news on Christmas Eve by blaming others. As battered markets slumped again, he faulted the Federal Reserve.\n\"The only problem our economy has is the Fed,\" the president declared of the central bank chaired by his appointee Jerome Powell. Yet simply by making the assertion, Trump negated it.\nThe end of 2018 makes clearer every day that the president himself represents a fundamental problem for America's economy and national security alike. Trump's erratic behavior and weak leadership have unsettled Wall Street and Washington alike \u2014 and there's every reason to expect things will get worse.\nFor much of the president's tenure so far, surging stock prices created an aura of economic well-being that made his conduct appear to be a sort of entertainment. After Trump and congressional Republicans passed a large, deficit-financed tax cut one year ago, an uptick in growth bolstered confidence even more.\nBut now shifting political and economic winds have placed the president's leadership under a harsher spotlight. The image is not reassuring.\nEconomic growth, which hit 4.2 percent in the second quarter, has already slowed. Forecasters predict it will keep slowing in 2019 as stimulus from tax cuts and spending increases wanes, with recession a rising possibility for 2020.\nThe administration's chaotic approach to trade conflicts \u2014 threatening deeper tariffs, then backing off for negotiations, then threatening again \u2014 has deepened uncertainty about the economic outlook. So have his reported musings about firing Powell.\nIn response, Trump's inexperienced Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, undertook weekend cleanup efforts that appeared to damage rather than bolster market sentiment. Stock markets remain on track for the worst year since the 2008 financial crisis and the worst December ever.\nTurmoil at the highest level of the administration intensifies the unease. After striking a deal with GOP leaders on an end-of-year funding plan, Trump reversed course under criticism from far-right Republican politicians and media personalities and triggered a partial government shutdown.\nHis impulsive order of immediate troop withdrawals from Syria \u2014 over objections from top advisors \u2014 alarmed national security experts across the spectrum. Defense Secretary James Mattis, the foremost calming influence on his team, resigned while signaling he doubts Trump's commitment to defending American interests.\nThen the top White House aide leading the fight against ISIS quit. Trump has an acting chief of staff and acting attorney general after firing both of their predecessors.\nJanuary promises to be even rockier. Democrats assume control of the House with power to roadblock Trump's agenda and scrutinize his actions.\nRobert Mueller's special counsel probe \u2014 which has already ensnared the president's personal lawyer, campaign chairman and first national security advisor \u2014 draws ever closer to Trump himself. Trump's family business, his charitable foundation, his 2016 campaign and his actions as president all face active criminal investigations.\nWith impeachment talk getting louder, presidential historian Robert Dallek recalls Richard Nixon's downward spiral from Watergate. Nixon fell not because of his political enemies but because of his own ethical and temperamental shortcomings.\n\"One sees something similar with Donald Trump,\" Dallek told me. \"He's a man of bad character.\"\nIn an era before cable news and social media, Nixon vented largely in private. As if investors or diplomats need more to worry about, Trump puts his embattled psyche on display even without public appearances.\nRather than performing traditional presidential duties, Trump watches television in the White House residence and vents at critics on Twitter. Always disclaiming responsibility for problems, he strikes out one moment at congressional Republicans, the next at the Fed, then at Mattis.\n\"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security,\" Trump tweeted shortly after noon on Christmas Eve.\n\"At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about,\" the president continued. \"Crazy!\"\nThis story first appeared on CNBC.com.

{{Tehran, Iran might not be the first city you think of when you contemplate the vast universe of envelope-pushing street art. But ignore the Middle Eastern hub and you'll miss the work of Mehdi Ghadyanloo, a street artist who's brought over 100 whimsical murals to the walls of Tehran's cityscape.\nOld Memories of Tehran\nGhadyanloo began decorating Tehran's high-rises and office buildings about eight years ago, seeking to combine minimalist architectural spaces with surreal scenes from another universe. Like exaggerated dream sequences, his images portray gravity-defying figures and portholes to other dimensions, all from altered perspectives that meld sky and structure. The separate illustrations are all mined from Ghadyanloo's own, fictional \"endless story.\"\nThe prolific artist has introduced us to the realm of public art possibilities in Tehran. \"Graffiti is illegal here in Iran, like in many other countries, so graffiti artists in Tehran work at nights. We have very good underground street artist [network],\" Ghadyanloo explained to HuffPost. \"As for other art fields, the economy in visual art and painting is a little better than it was eight years ago during the [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad presidency, but it all depends on economic boycotts against Iranian nuclear enrichment.\"\nThe seemingly strange explanation refers to the massive fine art collection that's been hiding out in storerooms beneath the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The museum would like to expand its facilities, in order to showcase the rarely seen masterpieces (including paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh and Monet) in a permanent exhibition; however, museum reps cite international sanctions as an economic obstacle to arts and cultural funding. And the lifting of those sanctions depends on nuclear talks.\nCheck out a preview of Ghadyanloo's beautiful street artworks below and let us know your thoughts on his creations in the comments.\nBolts\nSilence\nChildhood Dreams\nLife Locomotive\nFolded Walls\nFreshness\nWaterside\nWhen I Was a Child\nMosque\nTime Travelers\nLife Cycle\nHappy Stairs\nOld Memories of Tehran\n}}
{{On Friday, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial entitled \"After the Coup in Cairo\". Its final paragraph contained these words:\nEgyptians would be lucky if their new ruling generals turn out to be in the mold of Chile's Augusto Pinochet, who took over power amid chaos but hired free-market reformers and midwifed a transition to democracy.\nPresumably, this means that those who speak for the Wall Street Journal \u2013 the editorial was unsigned \u2013 think Egypt should think itself lucky if its ruling generals now preside over a 17-year reign of terror. I also take it the WSJ means us to associate two governments removed by generals \u2013 the one led by Salvador Allende in Chile and the one led by Mohamed Morsi in Egypt. Islamist, socialist \u2026 elected, legitimate \u2026 who cares?\nPresumably, the WSJ thinks the Egyptians now have 17 years in which to think themselves lucky when any who dissent are tortured with electricity, raped, thrown from planes or \u2013 if they're really lucky \u2013 just shot. That's what happened in Chile after 1973, causing the deaths of between 1,000 and 3,000 people. Around 30,000 were tortured.\nPresumably, the WSJ hopes a general in the mold of Pinochet (or generals, as they didn't break the mold when they made him) will preside over all this with the assistance of Britain and America. Perhaps he (or they) will return the favour by helping one of them win a small war.\nPresumably, eventually, the Egyptian general or generals \u2013 and we should let them have a junta if they want one, so long as it isn't like that beastly example in Argentina \u2013 will willingly relinquish power. After all, democracy cannot \"midwife\" itself. Presumably, the WSJ is sure a transition to elected government will follow, as it did in Chile. (Although, in 15 years' time the Argentinian writer Ariel Dorfman's words will, presumably, ring as true as they do now: \"Saying Pinochet brought democracy to Chile is like saying Margaret Thatcher brought socialism to Britain.\" More of her later.)\nSuch quibbles notwithstanding, I'm presuming the WSJ envisages that the Egyptian general or generals will then be allowed to retire, unmolested. Possibly to Wentworth, where the golf's good. But if any molestation does occur, perhaps by some uppity human rights lawyer, they will receive further assistance from the governing classes of Britain and America. He or they will then retire and, unlike his or their victims, die a free man \u2013 or men \u2013 in bed.\nAnd presumably, after another 20 or 30 years, when some other group of generals removes a democratic government upon which the Wall Street Journal is not keen, the people of the fortunate country in question will be told what is good for them in the same breathtakingly ugly way.\nI am not an expert on Egypt, or Chile \u2013 most of my knowledge about General Pinochet comes from a book by a Guardian writer, Andy Beckett. But I know enough that when Margaret Thatcher died, reminders of her enduring support and praise for Pinochet left a nasty taste in the mouth. While people are dying in the streets of Cairo, to read an expression of the same sentiment from a respected, globally-read newspaper is repellent.\nSo just why does General Augusto Pinochet attract such nostalgic, unquestioning support from some on the free-market right? Do they simply overlook the accepted fact that thousands were tortured and killed under his rule?\nPerhaps this might be a case of \"Say what you like about Mussolini, but he made the trains run on time\"? Bernie Ecclestone, the chap who runs Formula One motor-racing, tried it a couple of years ago \u2013 albeit he said it about Hitler (and Saddam Hussain), and we don't stand for that. Even Britain's Daily Mail was upset.\nPresumably, the Wall Street Journal's editorial board believes that because Pinochet \"hired free-market reformers\", he should be excused the excesses of a few death squads. That is, presumably, why they think a business-friendly cold killer in the Pinochet mold is who Egyptians need now to manage their \"transition to democracy\".\nBut really, I'm at a loss. There must be some sort of justification for such a statement. I just haven't the slightest clue what it is.\n}}
{{MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - The third-quarter reporting season kicks off this week with European companies on track for a second year of solid profit growth, but investors are shunning them even though valuations have not been this cheap since the euro zone crisis.\nAs a result, European companies cannot afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to attract investors back to a region they have spurned in favor of Wall Street.\nEuropean equities have been a painful trade this year, as political turmoil and the region\u2019s vulnerability to trade risks starkly contrasted with the allure of tax cuts, stock buybacks and a booming economy in the United States.\nEven a developing stock market rout in the United States and Europe this week hit Europe harder, taking the S&P 500 .SPX - fresh from record highs - to its lowest in just three months while the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark hit a 21-month low.\n\u201cThere\u2019s good reason to expect European growth is going to remain solid going forward but the U.S. is still going to be leading the global cycle,\u201d Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said.\n\u201cOverall the outlook is somewhat weaker [for Europe]. It\u2019s roughly half what we expect from the U.S. over the next twelve months. And geopolitical risks are likely to be a continued overhang for European stocks,\u201d he added.\nWall Street\u2019s biggest banks formally kick off the results season on Friday.\nOverall according to IBES Refinitiv, third-quarter company earnings in Europe are expected to have increased 14 percent year-on-year, against the 21.4 percent growth expected for the S&P 500.\nEurope's main equity index hit its lowest level since December 2016 on Thursday, bringing its underperformance versus the S&P 500 .SPX this year to 11.7 percent.\nThat has sunk European equity valuations to extreme levels. The discount to U.S. stocks is nearing 20 percent - a gap last seen during the 2009-2012 sovereign debt crisis which prompted hefty monetary policy easing in the euro zone.\nBeing cheap has not been enough to attract inflows, though.\nAfter being a popular global trade in 2017 the tide has rapidly turned for European equities on the back of economic and earnings disappointments.\nAs Britain\u2019s Brexit deadline nears and Italy seeks to loosen fiscal discipline, investors have pulled money out of European equity funds in 25 weeks out of the past 30, according to the latest figures from U.S.-based fund tracker EPFR Global.\n\u201cA lot of money has flowed out of European equities and I think that most investors are now waiting on the sidelines for confirmation that the situation is improving,\u201d Pierre Bose, head of European Strategy, International Wealth Management at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said.\n\u201cFor the over-allocation that you had to European equities at the end of last year you haven\u2019t been rewarded. You have withdrawn that positioning and haven\u2019t got an incentive at the moment to allocate to Europe away from other regions,\u201d he added.\n(Graphic: Europe's valuation gap back to euro zone crisis levels - reut.rs/2OhiUUY)\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\u201cTHAT MAKES INVESTORS NERVOUS\u201d\nThe gloomy outlook on Europe\u2019s trade-sensitive economy and fragmented politics has clouded the view on earnings.\nEven though European earnings are expected to rise 8 percent this year after growing 12 percent in 2017, over the last few weeks analysts\u2019 earnings downgrades have outnumbered upgrades.\n\u201cThat makes investors a bit nervous,\u201d Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich, said.\n\u201cThis normally heralds some pressure and for the next few quarters I expect a significant slowdown in earnings growth for the euro zone,\u201d he added.\nAgainst this backdrop, European companies\u2019 valuation multiples are unlikely to increase any time soon, at least until Brexit, Italy and trade war clouds are cleared.\nTo be sure, some investors are confident companies can deliver enough to push prices back up.\n\u201cWe expect some deal as far as Brexit is concerned, and that the Italian situation will sort itself out, and the gap in Economic Surprise Index versus the US suggests the numbers posted in Europe should be relatively good,\u201d Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at Societe Generale in Paris, said.\nCiti\u2019s economic surprise index for the euro zone has risen since June, an indication economists are beginning to up their expectations for the bloc, while the U.S. index has fallen.\n(Graphic: European earning revisions turn negative - reut.rs/2OfJUnQ)\nVALUATION STRESS DRIVES EARNINGS FOCUS\nWhile investors recoil from cheap autos and banking stocks, highly-valued luxury and tech sectors no longer seem to be a safe place to hide. That was clear this week when luxury stocks sank and Europe\u2019s tech sector .SX8P had its worst day since the Brexit vote, while in the U.S. the tech-heavy Nasdaq had its biggest fall in seven years.\nEurope\u2019s dearth of tech - the engine of the global rally - has hurt it on the up but could provide helpful insulation in a selloff focusing on the most expensive parts of the market.\nThe renewed focus on valuations suggests any recovery in European stocks hinges on companies\u2019 ability to deliver strong earnings. Any disappointment is likely to cause a bigger dent than the boost from positive surprises.\n\u201cGiven all the uncertainty from Italy and trade tensions I do not expect we have room for (valuation) multiple expansion,\u201d UniCredit\u2019s Stocker said. \u201cThe remaining potential for the European equity market is still earnings growth.\u201d\nCredit Suisse\u2019s Bose said it was unlikely that European stocks would be able to offset the macro headwinds over the next four to six weeks as they report their earnings updates.\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, October 10, 2018.

{{\nWe spent Tuesday at the Occupy Wall Street site in lower Manhattan, a stone\u2019s throw from ground zero. For those of us old enough to remember such gatherings in the so-called Sixties (\u201964-\u201974), the similarities were striking: spontaneity, solidarity, earnestness, and, of course, dissatisfaction with the status quo.\nBut equally striking was the difference: 40 years ago, the causes were ending the Vietnam War and extending civil rights \u2014 for African-Americans and, after a few years, women (though rarely to those of alternative sexual preference). Occupy Wall Street, by contrast, was mainly about the dismal state of today\u2019s economy.\nEven if you\u2019d spent an entire career since the Captain and Tenille last won a Grammy trying to make sense of The Dismal Science, as I have, you\u2019d have found the proposed solutions daunting. Into my hands was thrust a leaflet asserting \u201cJUSTICE = NATIONAL DEBT REPUDIATION = LIBERTY = FUTURE PROSPERITY\u201d and urging the creation of \u201ca global political party uniting the younger generation.\u201d Another simply itemized a \u201cList of Demands\u201d \u2013 36 of them.\nNational Health Insurance. Guaranteed employment for all Americans. Increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. \u202636. Feel free to add to this list.\nOne woman told me the core problem was the status of the corporation as a legal person, which should be denied forthwith.\nBut if any message united green and grey alike, it boiled down to this: the American economy is rigged \u2014 controlled by an elite which has used the political process to funnel prosperity to itself, and itself alone. Thus the alternative name for this movement of the moment: \u201cThe Other 99 Percent.\u201d You can hear some of the occupiers for yourself on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast.\nPhoto of Occupy Wall Street protest sign by Jackie Weir.\nOne final question: Why now? The country seems clearly riven when it comes to economic solutions. The Tea Party, the Republican candidates, Libertarians of all stripes blame \u201cgovernment\u201d for our economic ills and prescribe what rhetorician-of-the-month Herman Cain calls an end to the \u201cations\u201d: regulation, legislation, taxation. Those occupying Wall St., by contrast, think the very same \u201cations\u201d have been redirected by and for the other ONE percent.\nBut behind both movements is a devout belief: that the American economy is today failing to deliver as it has in the past and that tomorrow will compound the failure, unless we \u201cchange course.\u201d In downtown Manhattan this week, as in Herman Cain\u2019s speech to the Conservatives for Political Action convention back in February and elsewhere in the Republican litany, you hear the same shared article of faith: the American Dream is gone. The desperate aim of both camps is to restore it.\nThis entry is cross-posted on the Making Sen$e page, where correspondent Paul Solman answers your economic and business questions _Follow Paul on Twitter._\n}}

{{With the markets soaring as they have over the past half-decade, it's not as easy as it once was for value investors to hunt down fantastic companies at tantalizing prices. But it's not impossible. Both General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have a lot to offer investors as they trade at forward price-to-earnings ratios of 15.1 and 5.7, respectively, per Morningstar.com consensus forward estimates. Let's dig in.\nPowering growth\nGeneral Mills has incredible brand power with household names like Cheerios, Betty Crocker, Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury, Nature Valley, and Old El Paso, among many others. Yet its ability to generate shareholder returns is based on two simple factors: sales growth and margin expansion. Recently, General Mills also made it clear it was willing to make acquisitions to fuel top-line growth when it agreed to acquire pet-food maker Blue Buffalo (NASDAQ:BUFF) for $40 per share, or an enterprise value of roughly $8 billion, which some considered a bit pricey.\nIt's a phenomenal addition brand-wise and gives General Mills a leading position in the large, and quickly expanding, natural-pet-food category. America's growing love for healthy food isn't limited to human consumers. Pet owners are continuing to seek out more-natural and premium products for their favorite critters. From 2014 through 2017, Blue Buffalo's compound annual sales growth rate was 12% while adjusted EBITDA was an impressive 18%, and that could improve when General Mills' talent begins contributing insights on research and development, marketing, and distribution.\nAnother way to power shareholder returns is through margin expansion. General Mills has reduced costs in a big way in recent years. Project savings totaled only $75 million in 2015 but jumped to $350 million in fiscal 2016 and reached $540 million in fiscal 2017 -- and the project's cumulative target in fiscal 2018 is an admirable $700 million. That's pushed General Mills' adjusted operating profit margin from 16.8% in 2016 to 18.1% in 2017, with the latter figure topping its U.S. food peers' median of 17.2%.\nBecause of General Mills's significant brand power, its strategies to boost its top line through acquisitions and organic growth, and its plan to reduce costs and boost margins, investors should at least consider this value stock.\nPowering innovation\nInvestors know what General Motors brings to the table currently: high-volume sales of high-margin trucks and SUVs. Sales of those vehicles in North America have driven Detroit's largest automaker to record profits in recent years, but the company finds itself in a transition period as it hopes to optimize its high-margin sales during the near term while investing in smart-mobility projects, such as its Maven brand focusing on ridesharing programs, and autonomous vehicles.\nFor the near term, GM is focusing on market share in the truck franchise -- GM estimates it to be a $65 billion high-margin business. It has strong market share across the board, which is good news for investors because brand loyalty among truck owners is more than 30% higher than in other vehicle segments. Management is confident that the next-generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are going to perform well with eight distinct models that offer a bigger truck in every dimension and still manage a 450-pound reduction in overall weight.\nBeyond high-margin trucks, GM needs to show growth in adjacent businesses that include anything from General Motors Financial (GMF), OnStar, other aftersales products and services, and the future of smart-mobility services such as Maven and the ridesharing businesses it's testing. Management estimates it can improve aftersales, GMF, and OnStar profits by $1.5 billion between 2017 and 2021.\nGeneral Motors is positioned well to profit in the near term from a fresh vehicle portfolio increasingly favoring high-margin products, as well as in the future by focusing on developing adjacent businesses to drive bottom-line profits. In the meantime, GM will maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share -- a yield of roughly 3.6% -- improve its return on invested capital, and buy back shares. All those factors make General Motors a stock investors should take another look at.\nBoth General Mills and General Motors have been left behind by most of Wall Street, simply because the enticing growth has slowed as these companies grew into their massive footprints. But the recent move by General Mills shows it's ready to pull the trigger on acquisitions that boost the top line. And in time, investors might recognize the immense potential GM has through its adjacent businesses and the potentially lucrative future of driverless vehicles. Wall Street might find it hard to hate these stocks forever, and investors should keep both stocks on their watch list.\n}}
{{The importance of accurate forecasting is leading some firms to using so-called superforecasting\u2014a statistical approach in which \u201clarge numbers of estimates are averaged to find the most likely answer.\u201d This according to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn finance,\u201d the article asserts, \u201ca good forecast can mean the difference between bumper earnings and bankruptcy.\u201d Superforecasting involves a complex process whereby individual predictions are \u201ccombined and weighted, based on timeliness and past accuracy, until finally all of the results are melded into one forecast.\u201d The methodology, the article explains, attempts to exploit the \u201cwisdom of crowds.\u201d\nThe idea began in 2011 at a forecasting tournament in which thousands of amateurs competed against seasoned forecasters (the amateurs won). Those amateurs who scored in the top 2% now make predictions for Good Judgement Inc. (a commercial spinoff of the original experiment), which has conducted workshops for financial firms such as BlackRock and Oaktree.\nAnother company that uses this approach is Estimize, a New York-based financial forecasting firm that collects estimates from as many as 70,000 contributors when forecasting quarterly earnings. Each estimate is then weighted using a confidence algorithm that \u201ctakes account of historical accuracy within a forecaster\u2019s sectors, the freshness of the estimate, and the number of predictions he or she has made.\nRelated: How Financial Advisors Hire and Train Employees to 10X Growth\nFor more investment strategies, visit the Portfolio Construction Channel.\n}}
{{\nProtesters at \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d event\nAs the news media struggle to find a unifying theme behind the \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d protesters, a closer look at the activists behind the agitation reveals a transformative agenda aimed at assaulting U.S. capitalism.\nThe New York Times on Friday featured a video depicting the motivation of the Wall Street protesters without disclosing the radical background of some of those featured in the newspaper\u2019s piece.\nThe video was entitled, \u201cThe young and old on what they hope to accomplish by joining the Occupy Wall Street demonstration in Zuccotti Park.\u201d\nOne activist interviewed was Bev Rice, who has been sending online updates of the protests to the War Resisters League, where she has been an activist.\nThe League was one of the first radical groups to blame America for the 9-11 attacks.\nOn the very day of the 9-11 attacks, the League released a statement alleging, \u201cThe policies of militarism pursued by the United States have resulted in millions of deaths. \u2026 [M]ay these profound tragedies [of 9/11] remind us of the impact U.S. policies have had on other civilians in other lands.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the rundown on Obama\u2019s ties to \u201ccommunists, socialists and other anti-American extremists\u201d \u2013 all in \u201cThe Manchurian President.\u201d\nAnother activist interviewed by the Times was holding a placard that quoted John F. Kennedy stating, \u201cThose who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\u201d\nYet another was donning a red Kafiya, or Arabic headscarf with a specific pattern that has come to symbolize so-called Palestinian \u201cresistance\u201d against Israel. That style of Kafiya was popularized by Yasser Arafat.\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement launched two weeks ago and has been escalating ever since.\nEarlier, police closed the Brooklyn Bridge and arrested more than 700 anti-Wall Street protesters for blocking traffic lanes and attempting an unauthorized march across the span.\nThe protests reportedly spread across the U.S., including to Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles. The organizers\u2019 exact motivation has until now been sketchy.\nThe Twitter feed of a group calling itself Take the Square, one of the social media planners behind the Wall Street protests, has been blasting a multitude of messages, including:\n\u201cFight market dictatorship.\u201d\n\u201cPeople of the world rise up!\u201d\n\u201cWe are legion.\u201d\n\u201cTake to the streets.\u201d\nOrganizers have also been calling for rewriting the U.S. Constitution, imposing a \u201cRobin Hood Tax\u201d on most financial transactions worldwide with the goal of taking from the \u201crich\u201d to give to the \u201cpoor\u201d and giving the Federal Reserve permission to regulate interest rates on savings accounts.\nThe scheme seeks to bring to American streets the \u201csame indignation that has prompted the people of Greece and Spain to occupy streets and squares on a permanent basis, the people of Egypt and Tunisia to overthrow their governments, the people of Iceland to nationalize their bank system and rewrite the constitution.\u201d\nSo reads a call to arms by a group calling itself the General Assembly of New York City.\nThe group has been asking supporters to participate in a \u201cDay of Rage\u201d that started last month and seeks to escalate into protests across the nation.\nThe General Assembly of New York City has listed some of the possible goals of the current protests:\nThe imposition of a Robin Hood Tax on all financial transactions: The tax is the brainchild of nongovernmental organizations largely based in the United Kingdom. It calls for a new tax on most goods and services to be implemented globally, regionally or unilaterally by individual nations. The name of the tax originated in 2008, when Italian treasury minister Giulio Tremonti introduced a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies. Tremonti called the tax a \u201cRobin Hood Tax,\u201d stating it was aimed at the \u201cwealthy\u201d with revenue to be used for the benefit of poorer citizens. A prominent supporter of the Robin Hood Tax is Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist who crafted a controversial economic \u201cshock therapy.\u201d Sachs is a key member of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, or INET. Billionaire George Soros is INET\u2019s founding sponsor, with the billionaire having provided a reported $25 million over five years to support INET activities. This past April, Sachs keynoted INET\u2019s annual meeting, which took place in the mountains of Bretton Woods, N.H. The gathering took place at Mount Washington Hotel, famous for hosting the original Bretton Woods economic agreements drafted in 1944. That conference\u2019s goal was to rebuild a post-World War II international monetary system. The April gathering had a similar stated goal \u2013 a global economic restructuring.\nThe tax is the brainchild of nongovernmental organizations largely based in the United Kingdom. It calls for a new tax on most goods and services to be implemented globally, regionally or unilaterally by individual nations. Rebooting the system and rewriting the Constitution: The concept seems to be a reference to a plan to push for a new, \u201cprogressive\u201d U.S. Constitution by the year 2020. WND previously reported at least three White House advisers and officials, including President Obama\u2019s regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein, have ties to the Constitution rewrite effort, which is funded by Soros. Sunstein has also been pushing for a new socialist-style U.S. bill of rights that, among other things, would constitutionally require the government to offer each citizen a \u201cuseful\u201d job in the farms or industries of the nation. According to Sunstein\u2019s new bill of rights, the U.S. government can also intercede to ensure every farmer can sell his product for a good return while the government is granted power to act against \u201cunfair competition\u201d and monopolies in business.\nThe concept seems to be a reference to a plan to push for a new, \u201cprogressive\u201d U.S. Constitution by the year 2020. Reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, which sought to enforce more government regulation of the banking industry. Some provisions of the act allowed the Federal Reserve to regulate interest rates in savings accounts.\nWall Street protests to turn violent?\nMeanwhile, there are indications the Wall Street protesters are training to incite violence, resist arrest and disrupt the legal system.\nActivists advertised on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter for a \u201cDay of Rage\u201d on Sept. 17 to begin the \u201coccupation\u201d of Wall Street and continue with protests across the nation.\nPlanners have their own website \u2013 USDayofRage.org \u2013 which is not specific about the purpose of the \u201cDay of Rage\u201d other than calling for \u201cintegrity\u201d to be \u201crestored to our elections.\u201d\nThe site accuses corporations of using \u201cmoney to act as the voices of millions, while individual citizens, the legitimate voters, are silenced and demoralized by the farce.\u201d\nAdvertisements claimed the protests at Wall Street and nationwide will be \u201cnon-violent.\u201d\nHowever, the official website provides resources, including videos and detailed written instructions, for protesters to engage in \u201ccivil disobedience.\u201d The resources provided include instructions on how to resist police arrest and disrupt court hearings.\nSimilar instructions are provided on the website of an affiliated organization, which calls itself \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d and was also involved in planning the Sept. 17 protests.\nThe use of the term \u201cDay of Rage\u201d recalls the \u201cDays of Rage\u201d organized in the 1960s by the Weather Underground domestic terrorist organization co-founded by Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, close associates for years of President Obama.\nPurple shirt power\nIn March, ACORN founder Wade Rathke announced what he called \u201cdays of rage in 10 cities around JP Morgan Chase.\u201d Rathke was president of an Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, local in New Orleans.\nThose efforts are being organized by Stephen Lerner, an SEIU board member who reportedly visited the Obama White House at least four times. Lerner is considered one of the most capable organizers of the radical left. He recently organized the SEIU\u2019s so-called Justice for Janitors campaign.\nAs part of his planned protests, Lerner called for \u201ca week of civil disobedience, direct action all over the city.\u201d\nHis stated aim is to \u201cdestabilize the folks that are in power and start to rebuild a movement.\u201d\nIn an interview about the protests, Lerner outlined his goals: \u201cHow do we bring down the stock market? How do we bring down their bonuses? How do we interfere with their ability to, to be rich?\u201d\nForecast for American cities: Confrontation, intimidation?\nThere are other indications radicals and unions are planning chaos using the current economic crisis.\nLast month, WND reported that a slew of extremist organizations, some tied to Obama, are preparing protests to coincide with major NATO and G-8 summits in Chicago next May.\nForeshadowing possible violent confrontations, some of the same radical trainers behind the infamous 1999 Seattle riots against the World Trade Organization have been mobilizing new protest efforts geared toward world summits as well as the current economic crisis.\nThe NATO and G-8 summits are not the only focus of radical groups. WND reported Heather Booth, director of a Saul Alinsky-style community organizing group, the Midwest Academy, was among the main speakers at the \u201c2011 State Battles Summit\u201d in June at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill Hotel in Washington, D.C.\nBooth\u2019s husband, Paul, also was a speaker at the union summit. Paul Booth co-founded Midwest Academy in the 1970s.\nThe four-day summit was organized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, with participation from the AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest union.\nAn official schedule for the event, obtained by WND, declared: \u201cOur union is under unprecedented attack in every state. Extremist politicians want to weaken us as we head into 2012. Their tactics include budget cuts, layoffs, privatization and the denial of our very collective bargaining rights.\u201d\nContinued the flyer: \u201cNew challenges require new energy and new thinking. We encourage union activists to attend this conference and bring their creative ideas on how to overcome the challenges ahead.\u201d\nHeather Booth participated in a panel entitled, \u201cOur Message, Alliances and Best Practices.\u201d\nAnother speaker at the union event was John Podesta, who co-chaired President Obama\u2019s transition team.\nPodesta is president of the Center for American Progress, which is heavily influential in advising the White House. The center is funded by philanthropist George Soros.\nMideast revolutions coming to U.S.?\nCitizen Action of Wisconsin, an arm of Booth\u2019s Midwest Academy, is part of the Moving Wisconsin Forward movement, one of the main organizers of the major Wisconsin protests in February, as WND first reported.\nThe protests were in opposition to Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s proposal for most state workers to pay 12 percent of their health care premiums and 5.8 percent of their salary toward their own pensions.\nWND reported at the time speakers at the rallies likened the Wisconsin protests to the ongoing revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa while calling for similar uprisings in the U.S.\nAnd just this past week, former Obama czar Van Jones told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell that \u201cOctober is going to be the turning point for the progressive fight back\u201d and referred to the Occupy Wall Street protests as part of a \u201cprogressive counterbalance to the tea party.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see an \u2018American Autumn,'\u201d Jones said, \u201cjust like we saw the Arab Spring.\u201d\n\u2018Redistribution of wealth and power\u2019\nObama himself once funded Midwest Academy and has been closely tied to Heather Booth.\nBooth has stated building a \u201dprogressive majority\u201d would help for \u201da fair distribution of wealth and power and opportunity.\u201d\nHer husband Paul is a founder and the former national secretary of Students for a Democratic Society, the radical 1960s anti-war movement from which Ayers\u2019 Weather Underground splintered.\nIn 1999, the Booths\u2019 Midwest Academy received $75,000 from the Woods Fund with Obama on its board alongside Ayers, In 2002, with Obama still serving on the Woods Fund, Midwest received another $23,500 for its Young Organizers Development Program.\nMidwest describes itself as \u201cone of the nation\u2019s oldest and best-known schools for community organizations, citizen organizations and individuals committed to progressive social change.\u201d\nIt later morphed into a national organizing institute for an emerging network of organizations known as Citizen Action.\nDiscover the Networks describes Midwest as \u201cteach[ing] tactics of direct action, confrontation and intimidation.\u201d\nWND first reported the executive director of an activist organization that taught Alinsky\u2019s tactics of direct action, confrontation and intimidation was part of the team that developed volunteers for President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\nJackie Kendall, executive director of the Midwest Academy, was on the team that developed and delivered the first Camp Obama training for volunteers aiding Obama\u2019s campaign through the 2008 Iowa Caucuses. Camp Obama was a two-to-four day intensive course run in conjunction with Obama\u2019s campaign aimed at training volunteers to become activists to help Obama win the presidential election.\nAlso, in 1998, Obama participated on a panel discussion praising Alinsky alongside Heather Booth, herself a dedicated disciple of Alinsky. The panel discussion followed the opening performance in Chicago of the play \u201cThe Love Song of Saul Alinsky,\u201d a work described by the Chicago Sun-Times as \u201cbringing to life one of America\u2019s greatest community organizers.\u201d\nObama participated in the discussion alongside other Alinskyites, including political analyst Aaron Freeman, Don Turner of the Chicago Federation of Labor and Northwestern University history professor Charles Paine.\n\u201cAlinsky had so much fire burning within,\u201d stated local actor Gary Houston, who portrayed Alinsky in the play. \u201cThere was a lot of complexity to him.

{{2. China\u2019s April data run now comes with regular employment updates: The run of key monthly economic updates from China is due this morning. The country will report retail sales, industrial production and fixed assets for April, offering the first critical look into GDP at the start of the second quarter for consumption, business activity and capex investment. Of course, this data comes with a heavy dose of skepticism from the international investment community. That said, there are no data sources that offer a contradictory view that are also more reliable. And such, the data remains the foundation for most foreign investors who aren\u2019t hedge funds that take their own on-the-ground surveys.\nIn this economic mix, one particular data point stands out above the others: the jobless rate survey. This is the first time this series is being circulated widely, but it is a critical economic outlet for all developed economies. Though China is still classified as an \u2018emerging market\u2019, it is very much exposed to the same critical factors that places great emphasis on the broad health of the labour markets.\n3. The S&P/ ASX200 has all the hallmarks of a darling global equity index rally: Institutions are pushing their year-end targets for the ASX200 higher, and Monday\u2019s performance can only help to bolster their confidence. The index posted a 0.3% gain TO 6,135 but unfortunately continues to chase levels that were seen last in 2008. Recently, Credit Suisse moved their year-end target to 6,500 on the accommodative RBA, the view that earnings are expected to extend their rise thanks to rising commodity prices and subdued trade-war risks, and supported Chinese demand. The mining stocks looks set to continue their run, with implied data for BHP and Rio Tinto from ADRs anticipating further gains.\n4. UK jobs are economically important, good for Pound volatility but worthy of trend?: In the past month, the British Pound has slid across the board. Of course, the intensity of its decline matters heavily on the counterpart, but breadth of the loss is hard to miss.\nThis retreat has evolved out of a tempering to two fundamental themes that have been responsible for much of the gains the Sterling has fought for the preceding year: Brexit and BoE rate expectations. And despite data and rhetoric slowly chipping away at the enthusiasm on both fronts, the advance persisted, until recently.\nEmployment figures are often good for short-term volatility, but the more sensitive nature of the Pound recently could find this indicator triggering a more productive technical cue: such as an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on GBP/USD or simply extending its decline after this pause.\n5. China's ZTE has become a peace offering for Trump as trade talks accelerate: An unexpected Tweet may help investors see how Chinese firms like ZTE, a champion of Chinese state-owned technology firms and recently the world's third largest supplier of telecommunications equipment have landed in the center of the developing trade talks between Trump and Xi Jinping. ZTE was hit with an export band in April but now could resume operations \u2018within weeks\u2019 after President Trump pledged to get ZTE Corp \u201cback to business, fast\u201d and seeming uncharacteristically concerned about jobs in China. Trump added, \u201cToo many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\u201dWhen pressed about his surprised reverse course, Trump responded on Twitter, \u201cBe cool. It will all work out.\u201d Shenzhen-based ZTE was seen as a threat to the US National Security but now appears fast-tracked to be removed from the export ban. This development is a proxy to show the agile development and evaporation of the \u2018Trade War\u2019 fears that plagued markets earlier this year.\n6. Australian dollar\u2019s recovery has stalled: The Aussie Dollar mounted a remarkable recovery effort in the final 48 hours of this past trading week, but the move was notably lacking for tangible fundamental support. The disappointment in March home loans didn\u2019t exactly foster confidence nor did the trade backdrop seem to translate as readily for exchange rate as it did for equity index. Again, we find the modest warming in relations between the US and China offering the currency no support to start this week.\nAhead, we have the RBA meeting minutes; but there is unlikely to be a key detail from their neutral policy stance to highlight. The Chinese economic data carries more potential, but even that is limited.\n7. Traders remain keen on the outcome for oil prices after Trump\u2019s Iran decision: The global oil benchmark, Brent crude shows little signs of slowing down thanks in part to Trump\u2019s decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran. The move is expected to remove ~500,000 barrels a day of Iranian crude from the market, which Saudi Arabia assured they could replace.\nTuesday morning\u2019s positive price action should also be seen in the light of the release of OPEC\u2019s recent Monthly Oil Market Report where the cartel revised higher demand estimates 2018 that could tighten the market further. Base metals are mostly lower this morning, with copper suffering from a heavy stock build that accounted for the largest signal day build since March. LME 3month Copper fell below $6,900. Precious metals are also seeing selling pressure with XAU lower by 0.3% on a reversal of US Dollar losses.\n8.

{{On election night in 2016, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had an uneasy feeling. Lew was a Democrat and a native New Yorker, but decided not to join Hillary Clinton and other Democrats at a victory party in Manhattan.\nHis concern was that if Donald Trump were elected president of the United States\u2014a remote prospect, but not impossible\u2014the shock could be a black swan moment. That\u2019s Wall Street jargon for a highly unexpected event that plunges the economy into the unknown. The sudden arrival of a figure so unpredictable, with so little governing experience, could upend global markets and possibly require emergency government intervention. Lew decided to stay at his post in Washington.\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\u201cI had a bad feeling before the election,\u201d Lew recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI voted absentee, because I thought I just had to kind of be there if something unsettling happened, if there was a market reaction.\u201d\nInitially, it looked like he had guessed right. As vote tallies began to roll in, and the prediction needles started to tilt hard toward a Trump win, Dow futures plunged nearly 900 points. Asian markets sank. Gold, the ultimate safe haven in turbulent times, rallied hard. All the overnight signals pointed toward a financial shock every bit as big as the political shock.\nIt never came. The Dow wound up closing 257 points higher the day after the election. Pundits who had been predicting a Trump sell-off began to look silly. And so began one of the more remarkable stories of Trump\u2019s early tenure.\nOver his first year, Trump in the White House has proved every bit the disruptive force he promised to be. Much of the disruption was aimed at the business world. Even before the inauguration, he began jawboning individual companies\u2014something presidents generally avoid, and that frightens CEOs. He started making noises about punishing our top trading partners; he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. His administration has been buffeted by a series of destabilizing scandals\u2014and, maybe most alarmingly, his aggressive posture toward North Korean nuclear testing raised the prospect of war.\nAs each new disruption set off waves in the political realm, something totally unexpected happened in the markets: They ignored it. Stocks, already on an eight-year upward march, just kept rising, calmly breaking one record after another. The volatility index was down, as the market bet that prices would not just keep going up, but do so calmly.\nNone of the crazy stuff Trump said or did\u2014from boasting about the size of his nuclear button to firing the FBI director running the investigation into his campaign\u2014merited more than a shrug from investors. And when the market finally did hit a turbulent patch, in early February of this year, it wasn\u2019t because of anything Trump had done; it was triggered by a boring old economic indicator, an upbeat jobs report that made investors worry the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Even Trump\u2019s globe-shaking announcement last week of big tariffs on imported steel and aluminum only had a temporary effect. Stocks initially plunged on fears of a disastrous trade war, but they recovered nearly all the ground they had lost in just three days, as traders figured Trump would water down the actual policy.\nTo Democrats, the market\u2019s unperturbed optimism has become a source of consternation. Why can\u2019t Wall Street see that Trump is a news cycle away from bringing down the republic? To Trump, it\u2019s a gratifying endorsement of his leadership, a way to point at the scoreboard and taunt opponents.\nIllustration by Asaf Hanuka\nThe American presidency is the world\u2019s most powerful office, and its stability is the bedrock of markets. Was Trump really no big deal? I dialed up a dozen Wall Street players\u2014traders, hedge fund managers, some of the world\u2019s top economic observers\u2014to figure out whether all those anxious observers were getting it wrong, or they were.\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\nTo Wall Street pros, the story of Trump\u2019s bull market is part luck, part policy and possibly a whole lot of irrational exuberance. When investors look past the daily theater, they mostly love Trump\u2019s embrace of traditional Republican policies. He\u2019s slashed regulations and cut corporate tax rates nearly in half, juicing profits and pumping cash into the economy. And they\u2019ve guessed\u2014correctly so far\u2014that Trump the trade warrior and nuclear saber-rattler would remain mostly a cartoon character with little or no real-world impact.\nAnother reason for the stock market rise is that the United States is only part of a larger global story, one that even Trump has limited power to disrupt. \u201cThere really are a lot of forces at play in this rally beyond the president, including a synchronized global pickup in economic growth,\u201d Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, told me.\nBut there\u2019s another possibility: that Wall Street has it all wrong. If Trump really were the black swan he seemed on election night, it\u2019s possible that the kinds of risk he presents\u2014a constitutional crisis, a neomercantilist trade battle, even a nuclear war\u2014just aren\u2019t the kind of things that the markets can price in. And what I found is that some investors are wondering whether the market really is missing something, and that destabilizing moment might still be in our future.\n***\nJack Lew wasn\u2019t the only big-picture financial thinker who expected a Trump shock. In late 2016, Palm Beach-based hedge fund manager Doug Kass dubbed Trump \u201cthe Orange Swan,\u201d and warned anyone who would listen that the blustering political neophyte was certain to usher in an era of intense volatility, dragging down a bull market run that began in 2009 at the end of the Great Recession.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s win, Kass, a four-decade Wall Street veteran and a prominent market commentator, bet against the U.S. stock market, beefing up his short positions on the assumption that equity markets would fall. His theory, shared by plenty of other Wall Street pros, held that Trump\u2019s lack of governing experience, penchant for unpredictable behavior and pledges to rip up global trade deals and slap tariffs on trading partners would usher in a period of sharp volatility and potentially sink stocks. Trade wars would drive up consumer prices and damage exporters, while Washington ham-handedly lurched from crisis to crisis. In the early days of 2017, Wall Street firms even toyed with the idea of setting up \u201cTrump desks\u201d to buy and sell based on these potential White House mistakes, and to profit from the expected volatility driven by the president\u2019s statements and impulsive tweets.\nBut they mostly abandoned the idea when it became clear that while Trump news might dominate Twitter, cable TV and Washington cocktail party chatter, it really didn\u2019t matter much to the investors and trading algorithms that dominate Wall Street.\nOn January 25, 2017, for instance, Trump tweeted that he would launch \u201ca major investigation into VOTER FRAUD.\u201d Democracy scholars sounded the alarm\u2014voter fraud barely exists, and this could presage an attack on the electoral system\u2014and the media prepared for a potentially brutal political battle. Investors blew it off, and stocks rose for the day. Less than two weeks later, Trump ripped a federal judge on Twitter for putting his travel ban on hold and darkly warned of potential terrorist attacks: \u201cIf something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Political observers saw a constitutional crisis in the making. But markets barely budged the next day. When Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, Wall Street didn\u2019t care. When he tweeted on August 11 that military solutions were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for North Korea, stocks actually went up.\nThe market hasn\u2019t blown off everything Trump-related. Last August, the Dow dropped nearly 300 points in a single day after Trump\u2019s controversial comments about a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The fear then was mostly that the comments would drive out Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, widely viewed as a moderating, pro-free trade voice within the White House. (After yesterday's announcement of Cohn's actual departure, the Dow slumped a bit but didn't plunge, in part because the tariffs made it clear he'd already lost influence.)\nAnother Trump moment that moved markets came when ABC\u2019s Brian Ross erroneously reported in December that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to make contact with the Russians before the election. The report\u2014later corrected to say the direction came after the election, when Flynn was President-elect Trump\u2019s national security adviser\u2014sent the Dow down 350 points on concerns that Trump\u2019s impeachment could be a real possibility. \u201cIf you are trying to weight the different things that could send this market down, you\u2019d have to put an ugly impeachment fight near the top of the list,\u201d the head of trading at one of Wall Street\u2019s largest banks told me. (That drop also punctured one theory for why markets don\u2019t react much to negative Trump news: that Wall Street would be just fine with a President Mike Pence.)\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\nTrump\u2019s tweets have occasionally hurt individual sectors, such as on March 7, 2017, when Trump tweeted about a \u201cnew system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry.\u201d Pharmaceutical stocks took a tumble on the news, but most quickly recovered. And markets overall kept ticking upward, hitting a seemingly unstoppable series of new highs. The upward march became so predictable that the VIX, the market\u2019s volatility index, started hitting record lows. Betting against volatility became a thing, and traders who did so took a beating in early February of this year when volatility came back in a big way.\n***\n\u201cThe man in the White House is a bit of a moron,\u201d the hedge fund manager told me on the phone, \u201cbut he\u2019s a pro-business moron.\u201d\nI had called one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world, a multibillionaire who has been on Wall Street for a half-century. He voted for Trump and supports the president\u2019s policies, even if he despises the president\u2019s personal behavior.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s been refreshing to capitalists like me who felt like Obama had his foot on the throat of the economy, and now the foot is off,\u201d the hedge fund manager said between barking orders to subordinates. \u201cHe\u2019s pro-business in the sense that Reagan was, but without the charm.\u201d\nIf there is a unified field theory for why Trump\u2019s highly unusual presidency doesn\u2019t ruffle Wall Street, it\u2019s this: Beyond all the noise and bluster, he\u2019s mostly a standard-issue Republican. At the agency level, his appointees have championed fewer regulations on every conceivable industry, rolling back or postponing one Barack Obama-era restriction after another. Trump also signed a bill slashing the corporate tax rate nearly in half, fattening corporate profits, and unleashing dividend payments and stock buybacks, all of which help drive share prices higher.\nThe radical parts of Trump\u2019s presidency\u2014his nativist populism, his penchant for chaos and fights\u2014have confined themselves mostly to cultural politics, such as his sparring over the NFL and repeated demands for a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d with Mexico. The trade wars with Mexico and China have not materialized. At least so far, he has mostly tinkered with trade deals like NAFTA, and applied relatively small-time tariffs on things like solar panels and washing machines.\nThose conclusions are shared by other money managers and traders I spoke with, many of whom are Trump supporters. \u201cTrump raises the level of risks, but as long as he listens to his better advisers, the risks are not really that high,\u201d said the hedge fund manager.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Wall Street\u2019s top dogs would think so. In a culture in which big decisions are made based on exhaustively sifted data, computer models, and layers of managing directors and partners, there would be high confidence that Trump would listen to his advisers. But this is an area where the Masters of the Universe may have it wrong. Trump came up in a different business culture, a small family shop taking big impulsive bets. His whole life has been based on doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants.\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\nTrump supporters on Wall Street have also come to believe that the rally itself serves as an important check on Trump\u2019s instincts. Trump hasn\u2019t hesitated to tie his reputation to the market\u2019s success. \u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201d Trump boasted in August. He has followed up that sentiment dozens of times on Twitter and boasted of the stock market rally in his State of the Union address: \u201cThe stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.\u201d\nWithin the White House, this has become a way to keep Trump in check. In debates over whether to pull out of NAFTA or slap heavy tariffs on the Chinese, advisers including Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have often argued to the president that acting rashly could cause major market declines, robbing Trump of one of his favorite boasting points.\nIllustration by Asaf Hanuka\n\u201cInside the administration, Mnuchin and Gary have made that case, and others have made that case,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, an informal Trump adviser rumored as a possible successor to Cohn. \u201cHe\u2019s given free traders an unexpected source of leverage, and they\u2019ve used it.\u201d\nWall Street also knows that this isn\u2019t really Trump\u2019s market. The rise long predates his arrival and is subject to global forces well beyond his control. Kass, the Palm Beach hedge fund manager, attributes almost all of the market gains to forces well beyond Trump, pointing to similar stock market rallies in Britain, Germany, France and elsewhere in 2017.\nAnd the U.S. stock market itself has changed. Trump has presided over a period in which there is increasing demand for a smaller pool of publicly traded stocks, following years of mergers and delistings. Computers do most of the trading now, eliminating a lot of the emotional reaction to news that used to buffet stocks. \u201cMarkets are much less sensitive to news headlines than they were just a decade ago,\u201d Kass said.\n\u201cThis phenomenon of news happening that you think should impact markets not impacting markets has been going on for several years now. It\u2019s not really specific to Trump,\u201d a senior trader at one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks told me. \u201cNow you see stuff that normally would have caused real ripples in markets, and the market just blows it off. It\u2019s been happening since the bottom of the crisis in 2009.\u201d\n***\nThe most disturbing scenario painted by all the Wall Street pros I talked to is that Trump really does pose a massive systemic risk, and markets just can\u2019t see it or can\u2019t price it. Traders on Wall Street have come of age during decades of mostly traditional presidents, from Gerald Ford through Barack Obama; their models and assumptions are all built on an extremely consistent version of American governance. They\u2019ve seen nothing and no one like Trump.\nReckoning with a Trump disruption isn\u2019t a problem like factoring in inflation, or assessing a price-to-earnings ratio. How do you gauge the impact of a unique event like a constitutional crisis? How do you discount the possibility that an aging, narcissistic, insecure president could fire a nuke at North Korea in a fit of personal pique, or rip up NAFTA because he had a bad morning?\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\nPart of the reason markets don\u2019t react much to the North Korea talk, the senior trader said, is that there is really no way to model what an actual conflict would look like, so people just assume it won\u2019t happen. \u201cHow can you even analyze a nuclear war?\u201d the senior trader said. \u201cThere was a chance a few weeks ago that we were going to enter a nuclear war, and markets didn\u2019t react to that. \u2026 And yes, that is pretty crazy.\u201d\nWall Street now has to grapple with what\u2019s called \u201cpolitical risk,\u201d a practice more familiar to analysts considering investments in unstable regimes like Nigeria or Myanmar. The level of uncertainty in American political life under Trump is a new thing in modern financial history. And the giant run-up in stocks after Trump\u2019s win quickly, and possibly prematurely, extinguished early efforts to prepare for things to go very badly.\nKass, for his part, is not willing to junk the Orange Swan theory just yet. Pointing to the couple of sharp drops in late January and early February, Kass told me he was once again adding to short positions in U.S. stocks, much as he did before big declines in 2000, as the dot-com bubble burst, and in 2007, when the mortgage market collapsed.\n\u201cThe virtuous cycle for stocks may be coming to an end,\u201d Kass said. \u201cAnd when it does happen, it\u2019s going to happen with such rapidity that everyone who hyped up this rally is going to have their head spinning.\u201d\nJust as Trump may have had only a limited role in a rising stock market, there may be little he can do to stop any decline. In fact, it could be at least in part a shock of Trump\u2019s own making. The flood of cash flowing into the economy from the tax cut package\u2014in the form of higher wages, bonus payments and dividend checks for investors\u2014is sparking inflation fears. Lower tax receipts have also sped up the timetable in which Washington runs into the federal borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling.\nNow that volatility is back on Wall Street, following the whipsaw thousand-point-a-day moves in early February, there is a real chance that the gloss of optimism around Trump\u2019s presidency will end, and suddenly investors will start to worry in earnest about what he says.\n\u201cWhat happens is that when things go bad, you tend to focus a little more on realities that had been ignored,\u201d said Steve Massocca, chief executive of Pacific Growth Equity Management in San Francisco. \u201cAnd no matter what political pew you sit in, almost everyone recognizes the risks of this White House making serious policy mistakes.\u201d\nBut for now, according to Massocca, investors remain largely in love with the Orange Swan. \u201cWall Street loves Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might hate some of the stuff that he says, but it loves Donald Trump.\u201d\n}}
{{Even if the banking bill falls well short of blowing up Dodd-Frank, that's unlikely to stop President Donald Trump from claiming victory. | Getty Trump wounds but can't kill Obama's Wall Street rules\nPresident Donald Trump has made it his mission to undo as much of Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as he can. But when it comes to dismantling his predecessor\u2019s biggest legislative achievements, he\u2019s 0-2 so far.\nTrump tried and failed repeatedly last year to repeal Obamacare. Now, Obama\u2019s landmark law regulating Wall Street is emerging largely intact from the gauntlet of a Republican-controlled Congress.\nStory Continued Below\nCongress is expected to send to Trump\u2019s desk this week a bank deregulation bill rolling back several pieces of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed sweeping new rules on banks in the wake of the financial crisis.\nBut despite Trump\u2019s promises to \u201cdo a big number\u201d on Dodd-Frank, the bipartisan bill that is likely to be approved by the House as early as Tuesday leaves many of the Republicans\u2019 most-hated provisions of the law in place, including the foundations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the government\u2019s power to unwind failing megabanks.\n\"You take what you can get,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an informal adviser to the administration. \u201cIf I can get half a loaf, I take that over no loaf at all. I don\u2019t know if this would even be considered half a loaf, but it does make some reforms.\u201d\nThe failure to overturn the two milestone laws underscores how much more lasting legislative victories are compared to executive orders and other actions the administration can take without Congress. Trump was able to decide on his own to pull out of the climate accord, the Iran deal and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But he and Republicans in Congress have been repeatedly stymied on legislation with their small majority in the Senate.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame this on Trump,\u201d Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. \u201cHe\u2019s made some strategic errors, but it\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t try. It\u2019s just they couldn\u2019t get it done because of Congress.\u201d\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Though GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, Trump has still declared that the health care law is \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cessentially repealed.\u201d\nAnd House Speaker Paul Ryan, in the run-up to the banking bill\u2019s passage, characterized the legislation as replacing Dodd-Frank \u2014 an approach that House Republicans tried last year without success when the Senate refused to take up their bill, which would have repealed significant parts of the law.\nTo be sure, the bill headed for Trump's signature is still a notable win for the administration, and it rolls back oversight of some of the country\u2019s biggest banks. Thousands of small banks and credit unions will also escape numerous regulations imposed after the crisis.\nThe White House is framing it as a major accomplishment that in line with tax reform, regulatory rollbacks and judicial confirmations are part of an overlooked success story in Trump\u2019s presidency. In the case of Obama's health care law, Republicans did deal a substantial blow by repealing the individual mandate, which will become effective next year, and the legislation could be further undermined this year at the agency level.\n\u201cWe look forward to rolling back the onerous Dodd-Frank regulations on smaller community banks,\u201d White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said.\nBut the victory falls more squarely with Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and a group of moderate Democrats willing to break with their party to amend Dodd-Frank. The deregulation bill is the product of their years of negotiations, even while Obama was in office.\nThe core group of Democrats behind the bill included Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who are all fighting for reelection in states Trump easily won in 2016. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was also at the negotiating table.\n\u201cThere was give and take on all sides,\u201d Tester said in an interview. \u201cIn the end, I give Mike Crapo the credit because he was able to find the sweet spot to be able to get the bill through. That\u2019s how a negotiated process works.\u201d\nIn the end, 16 Senate Democrats helped usher through the bill, setting off a now-resolved stalemate with the House, where Republicans wanted to take a much bigger bite out of financial regulation. With the banking industry and the White House eager for a victory, House GOP leaders relented earlier this month.\nThe bill would scale back key sections of Dodd-Frank. Regional banks scored a huge victory by lifting a regulatory threshold that subjects them to stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve. Small banks secured streamlined capital requirements and exemptions from mortgage-lending rules.\nBut most of the nation's biggest global banks \u2014 including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs \u2014 will get little from the legislation.\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), who is vying to be the next GOP chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Republicans\u2019 attempts to do more were blocked by the Senate's 60-vote threshold to move most pieces of legislation. It\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s unlikely to change any time soon as the Senate remains narrowly divided.\n\u201cUntil we get to 60 votes, you can only do rifle shots that are very narrow in focus or something that\u2019s going to be less major,\u201d Luetkemeyer said.\nBarney Frank, the former Financial Services Committee chairman who co-wrote the 2010 law, said the bill on the floor this week leaves most of his namesake legislation intact.\n\u201cThe day that bill passes, that\u2019s the end of any significant legislation on Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Frank, who serves on the board of Signature Bank. \u201cIf the Democrats have the House, there will be no weakening whatsoever.\u201d\nOthers in the party aren\u2019t ready to declare victory.\n\u201cThey get as much as they can in each step,\u201d said Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who led the charge against the bill as the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cIt could always be worse. We could have more Democrats saying it\u2019s OK to weaken Dodd-Frank.\u201d\nProgressive Democrats and financial reform advocates, including Brown and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), fiercely opposed the bill, citing worries that it would give Trump-appointed regulators more tools to hollow out post-crisis restrictions on Wall Street.\nWatchdogs argue that even if much of the statute remains intact, Trump's appointees are already working to make life easier for the industry at the expense of consumers and the stability of the financial system. While the bill leaves the consumer bureau in place, for example, acting Director Mick Mulvaney is undertaking important changes using existing authority.\n\u201cA law like Dodd-Frank only comes to life and has meaning by what regulators, supervisors and prosecutors do or do not do,\u201d said Better Markets President and CEO Dennis Kelleher, who advocates for tougher Wall Street regulation. \u201cWhat we see in the regulatory arena is substantial broad-based deregulation and little, if any, enforcement.\u201d\nThe bipartisan bill aims to reduce rules on some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, but it leaves the substance of how that would happen largely to the Federal Reserve and its fellow regulators. That expands the already considerable freedom given to independent regulators under Dodd-Frank to work out the details.\nAfter the bill is passed, banks and their allies in Congress will keep pushing to scale back the law. Some will try to build on the feel-good bipartisanship of the legislation heading to Trump\u2019s desk this week.\nOthers, including Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), a potential contender for the Banking Committee chairmanship in the next Congress, have drawn up ways to circumvent obstruction by the minority party in the Senate to swiftly undo pillars of Dodd-Frank and its ensuing regulations.\nToomey has led an effort to find banking rules that can be rolled back using procedures that sidestep filibusters by Democrats. His most recent success was gutting 2013 CFPB auto-lending guidelines with support from just a single Senate Democrat.\n\"I don't think you should assume this is over,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt's an ongoing process.\u201d\nMatthew Nussbaum contributed to this report.\n}}

{{For one reason or another, many stocks seem to fly under Wall Street's radar. The companies often show strong sales and profit potential, yet they're ignored by investors who'd rather buy larger, better-known commodities.\nThat sets up a potential lucrative situation for investors who are willing to consider stocks that aren't as widely followed. Read on to find out why Motley Fool investors think National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ), Franco Nevada (NYSE:FNV), and Codexis (NASDAQ:CDXS) fit that bill.\nSparkling profitabilty\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (National Beverage): The $800 million of sales it booked last year was just a tiny fraction of the totals that established cola giants like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) managed. Yet National Beverage is expanding at a pace that Big Soda, and Wall Street, can't ignore for long.\nThrough a portfolio that's tilted toward non-traditional soda drinks, including the LaCroix sparkling water brand, National Beverage just posted its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit growth. Sales were up 20% in the most recent quarter as volume spiked 18%. Coke booked flat volume in its latest quarterly outing.\nThe even better news for investors is that National Beverage's prices are rising at the same time. And, combined with the increasing economies of scale, that success just lifted operating margin to 21.5% of sales -- passing Coke's result for the first time.\nThe fact that National Beverage has kept up this growth pace despite a flood of comparable products entering the market implies strong brand loyalty, good marketing, and a healthy distribution infrastructure. The company will need each of these assets as it works to establish successful franchises like LaCroix and Shasta as the kind of lifelong drinking habits that Coke built its empire upon over the last century.\nPay attention to this gold stock\nNeha Chamaria (Franco-Nevada Corp): Have you heard about a precious-metals company that doesn't make money from just gold but also oil and gas? And that the stock has been a multibagger in the past decade -- a rare feat in the industry? I'm talking about Franco-Nevada Corp, an incredibly interesting company that not only earns some of the biggest margins in the industry, but is also the most diversified precious-metals company with solid growth catalysts.\nGold isn't an easy business to be in given the unpredictability in metal prices. Yet, Franco-Nevada has been able to generate stellar shareholder returns and made investors rich over the years. The secret lies in the company's business model. You see, Franco-Nevada isn't a gold miner but a streaming and royalty company, which means it buys metal streams from other miners at a discount, or gains royalty rights over mines in exchange for upfront funding. Since Franco-Nevada doesn't own or operate mines, it's a relatively low-cost, high-margin business compared with a traditional mining.\nFranco-Nevada is now exploring similar opportunities in the oil and gas sector via royalties. The company made significant headway last year by purchasing several royalty interests in key oil-producing regions such as the Permian Basin and STACK play in Oklahoma. Oil and gas is a unique opportunity, one that I believe could boost Franco-Nevada's growth prospects even further.\n2017 was a strong year for Franco-Nevada, and it looks poised for another good year ahead. While the market focuses on the big gold-mining stocks, you should pay attention to this under-the-radar gold play.\nSmall-cap specialty chemical manufacturer\nMaxx Chatsko (Codexis): In 2017, at least some investors took notice of the progress being made at Codexis. The company's stock gained 82% last year. But even after that run-up, the company boasts a market cap of just $400 million. While investors shouldn't expect a near-doubling of the share price every year, it's not unreasonable to expect above-average growth for years to come. Why?\nCodexis wields a highly specialized technology platform allowing it to design, build, and test engineered enzymes for customers in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and food ingredient industries. Enzymes are complex chemicals that can be added to chemical manufacturing processes to lower energy consumption, reduce waste, and increase yield. The efficiency gains can save customers millions of dollars per year, some of which is passed along to enzyme suppliers for their part in the value creation.\nIn other words, it can be a lucrative niche -- and Codexis is just beginning to hit its stride. In the first nine months of 2017, product revenue soared 73% from the year-ago period, and product gross margin settled at 40%. Most of the gains were derived from increased business from pharmaceutical customers and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) manufacturing, the company's historical focus. But the enzyme engineering leader just branched out into food ingredient manufacturing, which should begin to contribute an increasing share of product revenue in 2018.\nCombine that with the foray into wholly owned biotherapeutic clinical candidates -- the first of which will enter clinical trials in 2018 with the help of Nestle Health -- and broad opportunities to license its machine-learning platform to customers interested in leveraging the unique technology platform (for eight figures a pop), and it may only be a matter of time before Wall Street is forced to take notice of Codexis' growth potential.\n}}
{{In 2015, Pioneer Natural Resources filed a report with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, in which the shale drilling and fracking company said that it was \u201cdrilling the most productive wells in the Eagle Ford Shale\u201d in Texas.\nThat made the company a major player in what local trade papers were calling \u201carguably the largest single economic event in Texas history,\u201d as drillers pumped more than a billion barrels of fossil fuels from the Eagle Ford.\nIts Eagle Ford wells, Pioneer\u2019s filing said, were massive finds, with each well able to deliver an average of roughly 1.3 million barrels of oil and other fossil fuels over their lifetimes.\nThree years later, The Wall Street Journal checked the numbers, investigating how those massive wells are turning out for Pioneer.\nTurns out, not so well. And Pioneer is not alone.\nThose 1.3 million-barrel wells, the Journal reported, \u201cnow appear to be on a pace to produce about 482,000 barrels\u201d apiece \u2014 a little over a third of what Pioneer told investors they could deliver.\nIn Texas\u2019 famed Permian Basin, now the nation\u2019s most productive shale oil field, where Pioneer predicted 960,000 barrels from each of its shale wells in 2015, the Journal concluded that those \u201cwells are now on track to produce about 720,000 barrels\u201d each.\nNot only are the wells already drying up at a much faster rate than the company predicted, according to the Journal\u2019s investigative report, but Pioneer\u2019s projections require oil to flow for at least 50 years after the well was drilled and fracked \u2014 a projection experts told the Journal would be \u201cextremely optimistic.\u201d\nFracking every one of those wells required a vast amount of chemicals, sand, and water. In Karnes County, Texas, one of the two Eagle Ford counties where Pioneer concentrated its drilling in 2015, the average round of fracking that year drank up roughly 143,000 barrels of water per well.\nDry Creek Water Station near Sanderson in West Texas, looking very dry. Credit: Brant Kelly, CC BY 2.0\nA Billion Missing Barrels\nAnd while Pioneer has become one of the most active drillers in the Permian, it\u2019s hardly alone in booking projections that the Journal found were dubious.\n\u201cTwo-thirds of projections made by the fracking companies between 2014 and 2017 in America\u2019s four hottest drilling regions appear to have been overly optimistic, according to the analysis of some 16,000 wells operated by 29 of the biggest producers in oil basins in Texas and North Dakota,\u201d it reported. \u201cCollectively, the companies that made projections are on track to pump nearly 10 percent less oil and gas than they forecast for those areas, according to the analysis of data from Rystad Energy AS, an energy consulting firm.\u201d \u201cThat is the equivalent of almost one billion barrels of oil and gas over 30 years,\u201d the Journal added, \u201cworth more than $30 billion at current prices.\u201d\nThe problems the Journal focused on will be familiar to those who\u2019ve turned a critical eye to shale reserves in the past: The most productive areas, or \u201csweet spots,\u201d are smaller than first expected and companies predicted that wells would dry up slower than they have. DeSmog launched its latest series covering shale\u2019s financial woes in April 2018 and our coverage extends back over a half-decade.\nFor the Journal, the take-aways were financial. \u201cSo far, investors have largely lost money,\u201d the newspaper pointed out, adding that a review of 29 drillers showed companies have spent $112 billion more than they earned from drilling in the past decade. \u201cSince 2008, an index of U.S. oil and gas companies has fallen 43 percent, while the S&P 500 index has more than doubled in that time, including dividends.\u201d\nThe industry\u2019s defenders argue that spending money now to make money later is simply how business works \u2014 this year\u2019s \u201closses\u201d are actually investments in future profits.\nBut because shale drilling is relatively new, even the experts are left guessing about how much oil will be flowing from the wells 10, 20, or 30 years after fracking \u2014 and investors have become frustrated as shale drillers have largely failed to turn the corner and start racking up profits instead of continuing to operate in the red.\nA natural gas flare in West Texas, near Midland. In 2018 the price of natural gas in the Permian fell below zero. Credit: \u00a9 Laura Evangelisto\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s only hope of paying off debt and rewarding equity investors is for oil prices to rise high enough for long enough that they can generate consistent cash flow without breaking the bank on capex [capital expenditures],\u201d said Clark Williams-Derry, director of energy finance at the Sightline Institute. \u201cBut they\u2019ll have real problems \u2014 sweet spots are getting depleted, wells are declining faster than they\u2019d hoped, pipelines are still constrained causing deep discounts in some markets, co-produced gas is close to worthless, and any sustained rebound will boost the cost for drilling services (i.e., higher prices mean higher costs).\u201d \u201cPlus,\u201d he added, \u201cinvestors need to worry about long-term cleanup costs.\u201d\nCalling in the Experts\nAnd the pressure on the experts charged with preparing oil and gas production estimates for drillers is enormous. As the first shale wells get older and more production history rolls in, engineers have developed models they say can make better predictions \u2014 but the Journal suggested those tools haven\u2019t been widely adopted.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we doing this?\u201d one engineer demanded repeatedly after John Lee, one of the most prominent reserves experts in the U.S., gave a talk in Houston in July about making more accurate shale projections.\n\u201c\u2018Because we own stock,\u2019 replied another engineer, sparking laughter,\u201d the Journal reported.\nThe Journal\u2019s reporting frequently cited Rystad Energy, an independent oil and gas consulting firm, as the source of more conservative projections \u2014 but, as DeSmog has previously reported, Rystad isn\u2019t the only large independent firm to find troubling indications that shale wells are on track to produce only a fraction of their \u201cproved\u201d reserves.\nWood Mackenzie, another major oil consulting firm, studied the Permian\u2019s Wolfcamp shale, where early projections predicted that production from a five-year-old well should be declining at a rate of 5 to 10 percent. Those wells, the firm found, are actually declining by roughly 15 percent a year \u2014 a significantly larger drop than expected and an ominous sign for any companies projecting wells can last 50 years.\nThings are looking a little drier than expected for the future of fracked wells in Texas. Credit: Francesco Ungaro from Pexels\nAnd fracking giant Schlumberger \u2014 which like Halliburton specializes in performing hydraulic fracturing jobs on wells other companies drill \u2014 has begun calling attention to a problem with much more immediate impacts: The sweet spots are getting too crowded.\nFor years, the industry has said that it can minimize impacts by drilling multiple wells from the same well pad \u2014 but in parts of the Permian, wells drilled later on or near existing well pads have proved roughly 30 percent less productive compared to the first well drilled.\n\u201c[T]he well-established market consensus that the Permian can continue to provide 1.5 million barrels per day of annual production growth for the foreseeable future is starting to be called into question,\u201d Schlumberger\u2019s CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in an October 2018 earnings call. \u201cAt present, our industry has yet to understand how reservoir conditions and well productivity change as we continue to pump billions of gallons of water and billions of pounds of sand into the ground each year.\u201d\nKibsgaard warned that similar problems are beginning to show up in the Eagle Ford as well.\nThe Long-Term Costs of a Boom and a Bust\nKarnes County is still the most active part of the Eagle Ford, with 562 drilling permits issued last year. After a heady oilfield boom, oil prices plunged in 2015 and 2016, leading to the layoffs of thousands of workers and royalty checks drying up. This past year, drilling has re-emerged, albeit at a slower pace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a boom, but there\u2019s a resurgence here in the Eagle Ford,\u201d Rick Saldana, an energy company superintendent told the Houston Chronicle in October.\nInvestors have faced a rocky ride. Sanchez Energy, the Eagle Ford\u2019s third largest driller, has now been warned twice by the New York Stock Exchange that it will be de-listed if its stock price, now at roughly $0.26 a share, doesn\u2019t soon rise above $1.\nWhat's so weird about the energy world is that stories like this and the wsj piece about the myth of the $50 breakeven (https://t.co/bg1gkrq9Sa) seem to live in a parallel world from all the bullish pieces about ever-soaring US production. Why? https://t.co/QSIjUc5cHV \u2014 Bethany McLean (@bethanymac12) December 6, 2018\nBut other impacts of the boom and bust cycle run deeper.\nIn nearby Dilley, Texas, a former oilfield man-camp, built to house Eagle Ford workers, was turned into the \u201cthe South Texas Family Residential Center\u201d in December 2014 by a private prison company. It\u2019s now the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention center for families, housing up to 2,400 people, half of them children.\nAnd while over the past decade, Wall Street and other investors poured billions into fracking \u2014 the Journal tallied $112 billion more spent than earned from production at 29 major drillers \u2014 the U.S. more broadly has failed to seriously invest in a rapid transition away from climate-changing fossil fuels.\nThat leaves the U.S. at risk of being left behind as the rest of the world focuses its efforts to innovate on renewable energy prospects that don\u2019t dry up like oil wells. Bethany McLean, a financial journalist famous for first breaking the Enron story, recently told Fortune about conversations she\u2019d had with major private equity investors as she researched her new book Saudi America.\n\u201cThey are all trying to figure out when we\u2019ll be able to see the end of the oil age, because as soon as that happens, the price of oil will go into secular decline (as it did with coal),\u201d she said. \u201cOther countries, namely China, are frantically investing in renewables. For us to crow about our oil wealth, and not focus on renewables, is for us to miss the opportunity to be leaders in the world as it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above.

{{If you\u2019re ever in need of a media outlet to relentlessly spin a story to heap blame on the symptoms of a government-created problem instead of the actual disease, you know where to look.\nJazz and I have been covering the saga of stupid that is the Renewable Fuel Standard, the regulation that requires U.S. refiners to increase an ever-increasing volume of certain biofuels into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. The original rule was passed during the Bush administration, but the Obama administration has done everything they can to bolster and expand the RFS, and refiners must either comply with the RFS or else purchase credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) to effectively purchase an exemption.\nThe ongoing political biofuels-battle was ramped up a notch this summer as energy companies have been cautioning that we\u2019re running up against the \u201cblend wall,\u201d the 10 percent threshold beyond which they warn the blended fuels will no longer be acceptable for most cars and trucks, which means demand for the credits have been spiking and prices have been rising (also perhaps exacerbated by the fact the the EPA has been trying to force companies to include a certain type of cellulosic ethanol that isn\u2019t actually commercially available in the necessary quantities \u2014 I am never going to let that one slide, ever).\nYou might be thinking that the solution for this absolutely not-clean, not-green, corporate-pork-tossing government program, complete with plenty of unintended consequences (like, say, rising food prices, no big deal), would be to repeal the mandate and hence stop creating an artificial market that forces U.S. consumers to purchase something they obviously don\u2019t want to buy. You would be wrong, however \u2014 and the NYT is here to let you know that, even though everything they\u2019re doing is perfectly legal and the EPA isn\u2019t even trying to point to excessive trading as a problem, those dastardly and \u201cexploitative\u201d Wall Street fat cats up to their old tricks must be at least partially responsible. Obviously.\nA few worried that Wall Street would set out to exploit this young market, fears the government dismissed. But many people believe that is what happened this year when the price of the ethanol credits skyrocketed 20-fold in just six months, according to an analysis of regulatory documents and interviews with more than 40 people involved in the market, including industry executives, brokers, traders and analysts. Traders for big banks and other financial institutions, these people say, amassed millions of the credits just as refiners were looking to buy more of them to meet an expanding federal requirement. Industry executives familiar with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s activities, for example, told The Times that the bank offered to sell them hundreds of millions of the credits earlier this summer. When asked how the bank had amassed such a stake, the executives said they were told by the bank that it had stockpiled the credits. \u2026 While banks are by no means the largest player in ethanol credits, Wall Street\u2019s activity in this market reflects a larger effort by financial institutions to exert their influence over loosely regulated markets for basic commodities, from aluminum to oil. The opacity of the ethanol credit market makes it difficult to determine the extent to which large financial actors have profited. The banks say they have far less influence in the market than others are suggesting, and are doing nothing wrong. But the activities, while legal, could have consequences for consumers. In the end, energy analysts say, the outcome will be felt at the gas pump \u2014 as the higher cost of the ethanol credits gets tacked onto the price of a gallon of gasoline. (The credits, which cost 7 cents each in January, peaked at $1.43 in July, and now are trading for 60 cents.)\nZOMG, Wall Street actively engages in \u2014 gasp \u2014 speculation?! Mind = blown.\nWall Street\u2019s interest in renewable fuel credits are not the problem behind rising gasoline prices \u2014 the renewable fuel credits themselves are the problem. The RFS is not, as the NYT refers to it, an \u201cenvironmental program,\u201d and everybody knows it, but they seem to be oh-so-gently suggesting that the answer here is still further financial regulation, instead of just flat-out repeal. Unbelievable.\n}}
{{Investors have seen this before.\nSince the bear market began in late 2007, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen into a pattern of huge declines, big gains, and then even larger declines. Four times, the market has rallied only to dissipate.\nThis past week, the market made a fifth stab at recovery, logging its best performance in months after remarks from bank CEOs and economic data led investors to believe they'd gotten too pessimistic.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rallied for four straight days from nearly 12-year lows, and gained 597 points, or 9 percent \u2014 its best week since November. That followed a two-and-a-half month drop in the Dow of nearly 25 percent.\n\"People have been worried that we're heading into this abyss,\" said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist. \"There are signs that that's not the case, and there is some floor somewhere \u2014 that we may have overreacted.\"\nBut is the worst really over?\nThere's no formula to figure out if this latest rally will stick. But market analysts are watching closely for signs that the worst might be behind us, and they say some good signs are starting to pop up.\n\"There are little subtle things that have happened that are good \u2014 good enough to see that market is trying to establish a near-term bottom,\" said John Kosar, market technician and president of Asbury Research in Chicago. \"But it's way, way, way too premature to try to make an argument that this is 'The Bottom.' \"\nHere are five reasons the market may have bottomed, and five reasons to still fear the bear.\nFive signs it may have bottomed:\nPumped-up volume: Market analysts say two signs of a bottom are the entrance of big institutional investors, because they hold stocks for the long-term, and high trading volumes during rallies. Check and check.\nMajor Market Indices\nPension funds, mutual funds, and insurance funds began snapping up bargain stocks last week after sitting things out for a while, said Stuart Frankel & Co. president Jeffrey Frankel, who works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And volumes on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of last week were about 7 to 8 billion shares \u2014 similar to those when stocks plummeted the week before.\nEconomy's bad, but could be worse: The U.S. economy might be horrible, but it's not the Great Depression. Unemployment is at 8.1 percent, and expected to rise above 10 percent, but that's nowhere near the 25 percent level experienced in the 1930s. And today, when people are fired, they can collect unemployment. Conditions are a far cry from shanty towns and bread lines.\nPlus, the economy's slide appears to be slowing. U.S. retail sales, after stripping out autos, actually rose 1.6 percent in January and 0.7 percent in February.\nZombie banks? Not quite: Before last week, investors were throwing around the term \"zombie banks\" to describe the big U.S. banks: Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moniker comes from the insolvent, federally propped-up Japanese banks of the 1990s.\nBut last week, these three U.S. banks said they've actually been profitable so far this year. They're also borrowing less from the Federal Reserve now. Bank borrowing from the Fed fell to $19.6 billion last week \u2014 the lowest level since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September, pointed out Miller Tabak & Co. analyst Tony Crescenzi.\nThe commodities bounce: It's counterintuitive, but Americans should be happy oil prices aren't falling anymore. After massive price drops alongside stocks over the past several months, crude oil has jumped 16 percent in the past three weeks.\nCrude oil and copper \u2014 which has risen 17 percent in three weeks \u2014 tend to be economic barometers, Kosar said. That's because if the cost of industrial metals and crude oil are rising, it means traders see demand trickling back. Growing demand means increasing industrial production.\nMain Street capitulation: Everyone at cocktail parties is talking about how they've moved into cash. Certainly, the financial crisis proved that Wall Street bigwigs aren't all smarter than the rest of us. But it's usually a good time to buy when regular folks are saying they've cashed out.\n\"A year ago, everybody was at the dinner table talking about returns,\" Frankel said. \"Right now, it's probably a good time to buy, because usually the masses are wrong.\"\nAnd, not to be undone, here are five signs the market might not have bottomed:\nChronic credit woes: The banks may not be dead, but they're still sick. So are those giant, complicated credit markets. JPMorgan analyst Thomas J. Lee noted that the markets for securities backed by residential and commercial mortgages have recently deteriorated to their worst levels since Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy.\nThe market needs a plan for these \"toxic assets\" \u2014 either by selling them to private investors, or allowing banks to mark them differently. A failure by the government to deliver such a plan sparked a selloff last month, and if investors don't get one soon, the market could be in for another tumble. Analysts aren't ruling out a Dow drop to 5,000, or an S&P decline to 500.\n\"We don't believe that the bear market's over yet,\" said Scott Fullman, director of derivatives investment strategy for WJB Capital Group in New York. Toxic assets \"either need to come off the banks' balance sheets, or they need to improve on the banks' balance sheets.\"\nEconomic drops are jagged: Economies, like stock markets, don't decline in a straight line. The recent spate of better-than-expected retail sales data could be merely a short-term blip.\n}}

{{NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. watchdog agency is preparing to investigate whether the Federal Reserve and other regulators are too soft on the banks they are meant to police, after a written request from Democratic lawmakers that marks the latest sign of distrust between Congress and the central bank.\nFederal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen in Capitol Hill, Washington February 11, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nRanking representatives Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee and Al Green of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations asked the Government Accountability Office on Oct. 8 to launch a probe of \u201cregulatory capture\u201d and to focus on the New York Fed, according to a letter obtained by Reuters.\nIn an interview, the congressional agency said it has begun planning its approach.\nThe probe, which had not been previously reported or made public, is the first by an outside agency into the perception that government regulators are \u201ccaptured\u201d by and too deferential toward the bankers they supervise, so that Wall Street benefits at the public\u2019s expense.\nSuch perceptions have dogged the U.S. central bank since it failed to head off the 2007-2009 financial crisis that sparked a global recession. The Fed\u2019s biggest critics have since been Republicans looking to curb its policy independence, but the request by Democrats could cool its somewhat warmer relationship with the left.\n\u201cWe currently do have some ongoing work looking at the concept known as regulatory capture. We\u2019re in initial stages of outlining that engagement,\u201d Lawrance Evans, director of the GAO\u2019s financial markets and community investment division, said in an interview.\nThe agency will conduct \u201can assessment across all financial regulators, and the Federal Reserve will be one institution,\u201d he said.\nIt was unclear whether the majority Republicans on the House committee, including Chairman Jeb Hensarling, backed the request from the minority Democrats.\nThe GAO has not yet determined what agencies might be involved beyond the Fed. The other main regulators that place supervisors inside financial institutions are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nThe worry is that these so-called embedded regulators working under the same roof as bankers will have clouded judgment as they watch for risky and inappropriate behavior.\n\u201cWe will cooperate with the GAO as its work on this report proceeds,\u201d said Fed spokesman Eric Kollig.\nThe New York Fed, which acts as the central bank\u2019s eyes and ears on Wall Street, has come under fire for a series of oversights and perceived conflicts of interest in recent years. In one instance, a former New York Fed examiner launched a wrongful termination lawsuit and released some secretly recorded tapes that portrayed her colleagues as being soft on Goldman Sachs.\nThat in part prompted a congressional hearing in late 2014 in which Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren warned New York Fed President William Dudley to fix his institution\u2019s \u201ccultural problem\u201d or, she suggested, he would have to go.\nThe New York Fed and OCC declined to comment on the lawmakers\u2019 proposals, while the FDIC did not immediately respond.\nTESTY RELATIONSHIPS\nIn the letter, Waters and Green said they are particularly concerned about reports of a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the New York Fed and the banks, and \u201ca reluctance to challenge\u201d them. The lawmakers want the GAO to use New York Fed actions between January 2008 and January 2015 as a \u201ccase study\u201d for the broader investigation.\n\u201cCongress and the financial regulators must fully understand the regulatory gaps and weakness that exist,\u201d they wrote, requesting an analysis of six areas including the independence of regulators, their ability to escalate concerns, and incentives they face to take jobs at the banks they supervise.\nThe central bank, which gained more supervisory powers in the wake of the crisis, has long defended its work but has been open to adjustments.\nA year ago, Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed takes \u201cthe risk of regulatory capture...very seriously and works very hard to prevent\u201d it. Two internal reviews were launched and, in November, one recommended improvements.\nYet the Fed\u2019s relationship with Congress has only grown more testy.\nRepublicans have repeatedly complained about opacity and a lack of responsiveness to requests, and have pushed legislation that would have the GAO \u201caudit\u201d the central bank\u2019s policy decisions - a move that Yellen has strongly opposed.\nDemocrats have also grown more critical since the Fed raised interest rates in December.\nAt Yellen\u2019s congressional testimony last month, Waters, usually a staunch defender of the Fed chair, raised concerns over nearly $7 billion in interest the central bank paid to certain banks last year to help it tighten monetary policy.\nThe GAO, which reports to Congress, already evaluates the integrity of the Fed\u2019s operations including its supervision of some of the world\u2019s biggest banks.\nThe agency is now determining objectives and selecting a team, Evans said, and looking to \u201cexplore the issues in the request in a balanced, objective, fact-based, non-partisan, non-ideological way.\u201d\nOnce the probe is completed, the GAO would report to the lawmakers and give them 30 days before it publishes the findings.\n}}
{{\u00d7 New Oil Speculation Rule Gets Wall Street Push Back\nWASHINGTON (CNNMoney) \u2014 Wall Street is pushing to stop a new rule that would crack down on speculation in the energy markets, which many blame for contributing to the spike in gas prices.\nThe new rule \u2014 part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street \u2014 would set limits on how much traders can buy, preventing firms from grabbing large chunks of the energy market.\nNearly two years after the new law, the rule has yet to be fully implemented. But that didn\u2019t stop two Wall Street trade groups from asking a federal court judge in Washington on Monday to delay or block the rule.\nRepresentatives of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which filed suit against the rule in December, appeared at a hearing at which they sought an injunction barring the rule\u2019s immediate implementation.\nThe Wall Street groups said in a statement that the rule was lacking on an economic basis, and would harm markets if implemented.\nThe suit spurred one commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the body that regulates energy trades, to urge that regulators speed up position limits to prevent consumers from paying more at the pump.\nCommissioner Bart Chilton estimates that Wall Street\u2019s \u201cspeculative premium\u201d has raised the price to fill up a Honda Civic by $7.39.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn on the television or the radio without hearing about record high gas prices, and yet the CFTC has not yet been able to implement Congressionally mandated position limits to put the brakes on excessive speculation in oil and other commodity markets,\u201d Chilton said in a statement Friday.\nEven if Wall Street loses in court, the new position limit rules can\u2019t take full effect until two months after the agency has issued a definition of what qualifies as a swap, which is due out in April.\nGasoline prices have risen in recent years as global demand grew. But the biggest factor for the recent price boost, according to analysts, is fear that tensions with Iran will lead to an all-out war that causes a disruption in oil supplies.\nLast week, traders set a record for the amount of money they bet on higher gasoline prices, according to Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service.\nYet, the lobbying group for swaps firms points to several studies that conclude there\u2019s little to no evidence that speculation in commodities markets causes price volatility.\nThe Commodity Markets Oversight Coalition \u2014 representing airlines, truckers and heating companies that depend on gas prices \u2014 says it\u2019s convinced speculators cause price spikes. They also point to studies that suggest a link and have decried the slow pace of a crackdown on Wall Street bets on energy markets.\n\u201cWe think these position limits are necessary \u2026 they\u2019re long overdue and the market would see a benefit,\u201d said Jim Collura, the group\u2019s spokesman.\n}}
{{NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Wednesday, plagued by a flattening yield curve that sparked concerns about an economic slowdown in the United States and weakening expectations of a lasting U.S.-China trade truce, while the dollar steadied.\nU.S. markets were closed to mark former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s death, but the effect of Wall Street\u2019s turmoil in the previous session, when New York-listed shares tumbled more than 3 percent, was felt in Asia and Europe.\nThe MSCI\u2019s all-country index .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.5 percent.\nTuesday\u2019s markets chaos came a day after equities boomed on optimism that China and the U.S. had temporarily called a tariff ceasefire to sort out their trade dispute. But doubts began soon after along with President Donald Trump threatening \u201cmajor tariffs\u201d on Chinese imports if his administration failed to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing.\n\u201cAs I look into next year, most expectations for further gains have been pared back. Investors have gone from extended bullishness at the start of the year on equities to an uncomfortable neutrality,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson.\nTrump\u2019s comments, alongside the drop in U.S. stocks and bond yields, pushed Asian shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS 1.4 percent lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.16 percent.\nMarkets across the world have been rattled by recession fears, exemplified by the flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve.\nThe benchmark Treasury 10-year yield fell to its lowest point since mid-September on Tuesday, while the spread between the 10-year yield over its two-year counterpart also shrank to the smallest since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008. That signaled to some investors an approaching U.S. economic slowdown.\nThe German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, November 28, 2018. REUTERS/Staff\nThe flattening of the curve gained momentum after last week\u2019s signal by the Federal Reserve that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate-increase cycle.\nThe dollar steadied on Wednesday after it took a hard hit in the early reaction to recession concerns and the initial thaw in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing sapped demand for the safe-haven greenback.\nThe greenback rose 0.32 percent against the Japanese yen and the euro gave up all its early gains to trade down 0.04 percent against the dollar.\nGold, which moves inversely with the dollar, slipped on expectations of more rate hikes following remarks from a U.S. Federal Reserve official and as some investors booked profits after prices climbed to their highest in more than five weeks.\nPalladium, on the other hand, surpassed the bullion for the first time in about 16 years, to hit a record high of $1,263.56 per ounce as higher speculative interest and larger supply deficit boosted the auto-catalyst metal.\nMarkets are also bracing for more news on Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, the start of five days of parliamentary debate over her plans to leave the European Union.\nThe pound rose off 17-month lows of $1.2659 GBP=D3 hit on Tuesday to around $1.2751, up 0.3 percent on the day, amid creeping optimism that Britain could opt to stay in the EU after all.\nThe threat of slowing economic activity also weighed on oil prices, but oil prices went higher on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the world\u2019s biggest exporters who will discuss cutting output to help shore up prices and curb excess supply.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures rose 39 cents to $62.47 a barrel.

{{After a tough week answering questions about his loan to his former employee, career federal prosecutor Michele Brown, Republican gubernatorial candidate Christopher Christie this afternoon tried to change the subject with an offensive on Gov. Jon Corzine, accusing the Democratic incumbent of engineering an income reporting loophole that allowed major corporations like Enron to hide debt.\nWhen Corzine was CEO of Goldman Sachs in the 1990s, Christie said, he was integral in creating Monthly Income Preferred Securities (MIPS), which provided a way for corporations to make debt look like equity, and later lobbied President Bill Clinton in a letter, also signed by 34 others, against reigning the practice in.\n\u201cThe Governor, as CEO of Goldman Sachs, personally lobbied to get a tax loophole for Enron to make debt look like equity. What this did was contribute, as you all know, to the precipitous fall of Enron when things that looked like equity turned out to be debt,\u201d said Christie during a conference call with reporters.\u201d\nThe charge is nothing new, however. Corzine faced the same charge four years ago, when he was running for governor against Republican Doug Forrester. At the time, then-Assemblyman Kevin O\u2019Toole (R-Cedar Grove) and state Sen. Diane Allen (R-Edgewater Park) brought it up, saying that \u201cCorzine profited while the people of New Jersey paid.\u201d\nCorzine\u2019s campaign responded back then that Goldman had not sold MIPS to Enron since the early 1990s, that they lost the Enron business to another firm in 1994 and that Enron\u2019s problems ate to the 1990s \u2013 well after any involvement with Goldman.\nChristie said the collapse of Enron, which was able to disguise debt through MIPS, cost New Jersey\u2019s pension fund $61 million, but that Goldman Sachs made $69 million in fees from Enron, a client.\n\u201cJon Corzine does not have a chief executive\u2019s mentality. He has a trader\u2019s mentality,\u201d said Christie.\nWhen asked why he was bringing up something from over a decade ago, Christie said he didn\u2019t think it had been properly vetted.\nCorzine\u2019s biography on the Web site for the governor\u2019s office notes that he co-authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was meant to crack down on corporate accounting fraud that led to the Enron scandal. One reporter noted that former Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-Md) praised Corzine for his involvement.\nChristie, however, said that the reform was equivalent to \u201cclosing the barn door that the horse has already ran out of.\u201d\nBut if Christie wanted to put the Brown loan behind him, most reporters on the call, who were miffed by Christie\u2019s avoidance of questions on the campaign trail after his mea culpa for not reporting the loan on his taxes and several disclosure forms earlier in the week, did not let him. Most questions were still about the loan.\n\u201cThere is nothing inappropriate about doing that and candidly I think this kind of continued drum beat on this in terms of the propriety of it is incredibly overdone. There is nothing wrong with a superior giving a subordinate a loan,\u201d he said.\nChristie said that although he did not make himself available to the press every day last week, he did over the weekend, attending parades in Iselin and Jersey City.\nAlthough Christie gave Brown a promotion to the offices No. 2 spot shortly before he resigned from the post, he said that she did not receive a raise \u2013 that, as a 14 year staffer, she had already reached the top salary, which was $100 less than he made as U.S. Attorney. Brown\u2019s bonuses, Christie said, were the same as every other staffer.\n\u201cShe did not get raises that coincided with her promotions because she was at the top of her pay scale,\u201d he said.\n}}
{{WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Washington\u2019s attempts to curb some high executive pay may represent profound government intervention in the decisions of private companies.\nBut given America\u2019s mood \u2013 with voters outraged at some huge Wall Street bonuses in the midst of recession \u2013 Thursday\u2019s actions by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury may have been inevitable. The Fed and Treasury will try to curtail compensation at firms where the US has leverage.\n\u201cAbsolutely this is a response to political pressure,\u201d says J.W. Verret, a corporate-compensation expert and assistant professor at the George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Va.\nOn Thursday, the Treasury Department announced that it is ordering the seven big companies that have yet to pay back government bailout cash to cut the total compensation for top executives in half.\nSome individuals may see their pay package reduced by up to 90 percent. Lush perks like corporate jets and free country-club memberships may be out.\nThe pay cuts take effect next month. According to Treasury pay czar Kenneth Feinberg, the government did not want to make executives return compensation already received.\nThe firms in question are AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, General Motors, GMAC Financial Services, Chrysler, and Chrysler Financial. They will be under the compensation caps until they pay back all the money that the government lent them under bailout programs.\n\u201cIt does offend our values\u201d when executives reap big pay after being rescued by the government, President Obama said.\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve announced a sweeping plan to try to ensure that thousands of US banks, including many that never accepted a bailout, don\u2019t encourage employees to take the sort of reckless gambles that helped contribute to the financial crisis.\nThe Fed program does not involve hard pay caps. Rather, regulators will review compensation programs to try to make sure they reward long-term performance instead of short-term goals.\n\u201cCompensation practices at some banking organizations have led to misaligned incentives and excessive risk taking, contributing to bank losses and financial instability,\u201d said Fed chairman Ben Bernanke.\nThese efforts may be unprecedented. Not since industry and government worked hand in hand during World War II has Uncle Sam had such say in day-to-day firm operations.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been anything like this,\u201d says Professor Verret of George Mason.\nHe\u2019s also not sure it will ensure stability of the financial system. Capping pay does not attack the problem of moral hazard, for instance, in which those who run big firms think that the government won\u2019t let them fail because they are too crucial to the economy as a whole.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a misguided attempt to link executive compensation with the financial crisis,\u201d he says.\nIn addition to capping pay at firms that still owe the government money, the Treasury Department is pushing some corporate-governance reforms onto these firms, including a forced separation of the positions of chief executive and chairman of the board.\nThese actions represent major change, says Espen Eckbo, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.\n\u201cI was surprised at how far they went\u201d in ordering corporate-governance reform among the bailout firms, says Mr. Eckbo.\n}}
{{Today, Occupy Wall Street protestors will be joined by members of several major unions: New York State United Teachers, Service Employees International Union, and the Transport Workers Union. They\u2019ll stage a march at 4:30 p.m. today, and organizers estimate it will be the biggest crowd of protestors to date, perhaps drawing between 3,000\u20135,000 people. On other days, when the crowd has been big and mobile (the marches to Union Square and across the Brooklyn Bridge), there\u2019s been violence and arrests; whether that will happen today remains to be seen. So far, the arrests have actually been useful to the protestors in getting publicity \u2014 the strong-arm tactics of the NYPD (who\u2019ve been using a practice called \u201ctrap and detain\u201d during the marches) \u2014 provided the movement with a clear villain.\nBut the unions\u2019 solidarity represents another way for the protests to grow rapidly, and to potentially get a large (and organized) swath of people involved nationally, and for reasons more on-message than anger about police brutality. In addition to the groups marching today, the AFL\u2013CIO is considering a unionwide endorsement; the Service Employees\u2019 union is throwing a separate rally in support of Occupy Wall Street on October 12. Other unions could follow. \u201cMostly what we think is necessary is logistical support \u2014 sometimes technology, sometimes money, sometimes people,\u201d SEIU\u2019s president told Mother Jones.\nAlready, the unions have been involved in a supporting role. Transport Workers Union Local 100 went to court to ask for an injunction against being asked to drive arrested protestors in city buses. Plus, says Mother Jones:\nSEIU 1199, in New York, recently delivered water and clothes to Occupy Wall Street protesters, as well as enough pizza to feed 200 people, spokeswoman Leah Gonzalez wrote in an email. The Amalgamated Transit Union is putting together a group of lawyers to offer legal help to Occupy Wall Street protesters if they need it, according to ATU president Larry Hanley. And ATU members are also joining the small but growing Occupy DC protests demanding an end to the flow of corporate cash in American politics.\nIt might be an odd-couple marriage \u2014 it\u2019s unclear how much, say, an Anonymous activist and a city bus driver might find to talk about over a beer \u2014 but it\u2019s one that both parties seem eager for. Unions have watched the tea party tap into a vein of populist rage that has been notably absent on the left, and Occupy Wall Street gives them something to coalesce around. The protestors, meanwhile, stand a much better chance of actually appealing to more of the so-called 99 percent with a broader coalition \u2014 not to mention counteracting the lingering perception that they\u2019re a bunch of hippies.\nEarlier: Labor Unions and Leftist Groups Prepare to Join Occupy Wall Street As Protesters Settle In\nOccupy Wall Street, Powered by Big Labor [Mother Jones]\n}}
{{Two years after a group of activists first sat down in Zuccotti Park to start Occupy Wall Street, one branch of the movement that formed as an angry reaction to unfair financial institutions plans to debut its very own Occupy-branded debit card. The New York Times reports on a project called the Occupy Money Cooperative, which has apparently been in the planning stages for some time, and whose goal is to offer financial products to marginalized people who might otherwise not be able to get them. Its first such product would be a cheap, pre-paid, Occupy-branded debit card, offered as an alternative to the often predatory pre-paid debit cards endorsed by the likes of Justin Bieber and the Kardashians.\nWhile many of those pre-paid cards charge exorbitant monthly fees and transaction fees, and generally nickel-and-dime customers to death, the Occupy card plans a minimal fee structure: $1.95 for withdrawals, $.99 to check the balance, $.99 a month. The group started raising funds on Sept. 17, Occupy\u2019s two-year anniversary, and says it needs about $900,000 before it could start offering the cards.\nBut to make the card work in any realistic way, Occupy Money says it has to partner with a company that basically stands for the opposite of Occupy Wall Street: Visa. A cooperative member, Carne Ross, \u201csaid his group had no choice but to do business with that company or a similar one in order to produce a debit card that could be widely accepted.\u201d Well, no choice aside from founding a financial firm that would rival Visa \u2026 and thereby become the street they once occupied.\n}}

There\u2019s a way to do that so it looks halfway decent, so you won\u2019t look like a total dork.\u201d Things didn\u2019t go quite that smoothly, however. \u201cFor continuity, I had to wear a wig, a longhair wig, throughout the movie,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cSo I go to put my hippie wig on and I look like Veronica Lake.\u201d Despite his shaggy appearance, the role earned him a Golden Globe nomination as most promising male newcomer.\nFilling the Nest\n\u201cCasting was crucial,\u201d Douglas said about his Oscar-winning adaptation of Ken Kesey\u2019s novel \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d Douglas, who produced the film, worked closely with director Milos Forman to fill the fictional Oregon mental institution with the perfect rogues\u2019 gallery of patients and staff. Several stars were approached to play the lead, including Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando, both who turned the part down. According to Douglas, Forman lobbied hard to cast Burt Reynolds in the role because he had what the director described as \u201ccheap charisma.\u201d Casting Nurse Ratched proved equally difficult. \u201cWith all due respect to the ladies out there,\u201d Douglas said, \u201cthe woman\u2019s movement at that particular time said that a woman could not play the bad guy.\u201d Jane Fonda and Angela Lansbury passed on the role before Louise Fletcher was eventually cast.\nSilent Meltdown\nDouglas learned a valuable lesson about sound (or the lack thereof) while producing his next hit, \u201cThe China Syndrome.\u201d The film depicts a series of accidents at a fictional nuclear power plant, culminating in a tense near-meltdown sequence. Yet in the editing room, something just didn\u2019t feel right to Douglas. \u201cWe were doing our final mix, putting things together, and I was really impressed with our sound editors in terms of all these unique sounds they found for the control room,\u201d Douglas said. The problem came with the addition of music. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the final mix and we had music by a very good guy, and this weird thing happened,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cAll of a sudden we add the music and it became melodramatic. It lost its vitality.\u201d The risky solution was to remove the entire score. Without the music, \u201cit became taut,\u201d Douglas said.\nTragic Jewel\n\u201cThat was the lowest point in my producing career,\u201d Douglas said, referring to \u201cThe Jewel of the Nile,\u201d the trouble-plagued followup to his blockbuster hit \u201cRomancing the Stone.\u201d The film\u2019s difficult production was marked with repeated tragedy, including a plane crash in Morocco that killed six production team members, as well as the death of 39-year old screenwriter Diane Thomas, who wrote \u201cRomancing the Stone\u201d and consulted on the sequel. To thank Thomas for her contributions to the film, Douglas asked her what type of car she liked. \u201cShe said a Porsche, and so I got her a Porsche,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThe last time I saw her was when she took me out to the parking lot to show me the Porsche. And then she got killed in a car accident in it two weeks later.\u201d\nStone\u2019s Gambit\nDouglas earned an Oscar for Best Actor in Oliver Stone\u2019s 1987 financial drama \u201cWall Street,\u201d in large part thanks to Stone\u2019s psychological method of direction. Two weeks into shooting, Stone came to Douglas\u2019s trailer with a serious problem. \u201cHe said, \u2018Michael are you doing drugs? Because you look like you\u2019ve never acted before in your life.\u2019\u201d Douglas, though concerned, had no idea what Stone was talking about. \u201cI never look at dailies,\u201d Douglas said, \u201cSo I assumed I\u2019d better go take a look. And he said \u2018yeah, you\u2019d better.\u2019\u201d Not surprisingly, what he saw \u201clooked pretty good.\u201d The confrontation was a ruse on Stone\u2019s part. \u201cOliver wanted just a little bit more anger,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cHe was willing to forgo our relationship to get that performance, and I went to town and worked my ass off after that conversation.\u201d According to Douglas, Stone\u2019s \u201cVietnam mentality\u201d is what made all the difference. \u201cHe wants you in the trench with him.\u201d\nCourting Controversy\nThe gritty 1993 thriller \u201cFalling Down\u201d gave Douglas one of his most memorable roles. \u201cIt hit on the zeitgeist,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a picture that\u2019s constantly brought up as one that people genuinely like.\u201d That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t without controversy, however. The film\u2019s edgy violence and dark subject matter drew complaints from some ethnic groups. \u201cI remember for instance, there was a Korean grocer\u2019s scene where I go in and go ballistic,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cSoon after the picture was released, I got a call from Warner Brothers, saying, \u2018Mike can you come down here? We\u2019d like you to meet the head of the Korean grocers association.\u2019\u201d The group objected to the sequence, which they felt portrayed Koreans in a negative light. Douglas did his best to address their concerns. \u201cI tried to explain that there\u2019s a reason why the writer took the scene and made it what it is,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cAnd as a result of that meeting the Korean grocers association put those smile buttons on everyone\u2019s shirts.\u201d\n}}

Riley\u2019s Eric Wold upgraded the industry. AMC Entertainment shares are +3.2% in early trading, and Cinemark is +2.4%, after Wold changed his recommendation for both to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d He also raised price targets for Regal, Carmike, and 3D technology company RealD. Although the summer pop corn movie season has only just begun, Wold says that the early results were good enough for him to change his forecast for Q2 and Q3 to flat box office revenues vs the strong sales from the period last year, as opposed to a low-single digit decline. He\u2019s especially impressed with premium ticket sales for 3D and IMAX venues, which collectively accounted for 51% of the opening weekend sales for Godzilla. Last year\u2019s Gravity \u201cintroduced more movie-goers to the benefits of seeing a movie in 3D,\u201d he says. In addition, studios are picking better films to offer in 3D while theaters schedule them to become \u201cmore of the default choice as opposed to an upgrade decision.\u201d Once investors move past their concerns about the summer 2014 box office, he says, they\u2019ll focus on 2015 could set a record with sequels for hits including the Avengers, the Hunger Games, Mission: Impossible, Fast And Furious, and James Bond.\nStill, some other analysts remain skeptical about summer 2014. MKM Partners\u2019 Eric Handler says box office sales so far in Q2 are down 3.1% and he expects them to end up down 4.5%. Although the next two weekends should be strong, \u201cvery difficult comparisons loom in the later half of June (when Man Of Steel, Monsters University and World War Z opened to $117M, $82M and $66M, respectively)\u201d last year, he says.\n}}
{{Wall Street Journal elitism, by the numbers This year, the newspaper has published 51 articles about caviar -- and 5 about employee ownership\nSocial pain, anger at ecological degradation and the inability of traditional politics to address deep economic failings has fueled an extraordinary amount of practical on-the-ground institutional experimentation and innovation by activists, economists and socially minded business leaders in communities around the country.\nA vast democratized \"new economy\" is slowly emerging throughout the United States. The general public, however, knows almost nothing about it because the American press simply does not cover the developing institutions and strategies.\nAdvertisement:\nFor instance, a sample assessment of coverage between January and November of 2012 by the most widely circulated newspaper in the United States, the Wall Street Journal, found ten times more references to caviar than to employee-owned firms, a growing sector of the economy that involves more than $800 billion in assets and 10 million employee-owners\u2014around three million more individuals than are members of unions in the private sector.\nClick to enlarge.\nWorker ownership\u2014the most common form of which involves ESOPs, or Employee Stock Ownership Plans\u2014was mentioned in a mere five articles. By contrast, over 60 articles referred to equestrian activities like horse racing, and golf clubs appeared in 132 pieces over the same period.\nAlthough 2012 was designated by the United Nations as the International Year of the Cooperative\u2014an institution that now has more than one billion members worldwide\u2014the Journal\u2019s coverage was similarly thin. More than 120 million Americans are members of co-operatives and cooperative credit unions, 30 million more people than are owners of mutual funds. The Journal, however, devoted some 700 articles to mutual funds between January and October and only 183 to cooperatives. Of these the majority were concerned with high-end New York real estate, with headlines like \u201cPricey Co-ops Find Buyers\u201d\nThe vast number of cooperative businesses on Main Streets across the country were discussed in just 70 articles and a mere 14 gave co-op businesses more than passing mention. Together, the articles only narrowly outnumbered the 13 Journal pieces that mentioned the Dom Perignon brand of champagne over the same time frame, and were eclipsed by the 40 Journal entries that refer to the French delicacy foie gras.\nAdvertisement:\nClick to enlarge.\nAnother democratized economic institution is the not-for-profit Community Development Corporation (CDC), roughly 4,500 of which operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Such neighborhood corporations create tens of thousands of units of affordable housing and millions of square feet of commercial and industrial space a year. The Journal ran no articles mentioning CDCs in 2012 and only 43 over the past 28 years\u2014less than two a year. Meanwhile, the word ch\u00e2teau appeared in 30 times as many articles, and luxury apartments received 300 times as much coverage over the same period.\nClick to enlarge.\nNot surprisingly, the growing \u201cnew economy movement\u201d championing democratization of the economy has itself received even less coverage, despite growing citizen involvement on many levels. Over the past year, major national, state and other conferences focusing on worker-owned companies, cooperatives, public banking, nonprofit and public land trusts, and neighborhood corporations were oversubscribed, reflecting the growing interest in these forms. The Journal, however, gave scant coverage to the movement.\nThousands of other creative projects\u2014from green businesses to new forms of combined community-worker efforts\u2014are also underway across the country but receive little coverage. A number are self-consciously understood as attempts to develop working prototypes in state and local \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d that may be applied at regional and national scale when the right political moment occurs. In Cleveland, Ohio, for instance, a complex of sophisticated worker-owned firms has been developing in desperately poor, predominantly black neighborhoods. The model is partially structured along lines of the Mondrag\u00f3n Corporation, a vibrant network of worker-owned cooperatives in northern Spain with more than 80,000 members and billions of dollars in annual revenue.\nAdvertisement:\nSince 2010 legislation to set up public banks along the lines of the long-established Bank of North Dakota has been proposed in twenty states. Several cities\u2014including Los Angeles and Kansas City\u2014have passed \u201cresponsible banking\u201d ordinances that require banks to reveal their impact on the community and/or require city officials to do business only with banks that are responsive to community needs. But municipally led responsible banking initiatives appear to have received no attention in the Journal, whereas the newspaper published seven articles this year discussing President Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\nClick to enlarge.\nThe limited nature of the coverage can also be seen in particular cases. Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI) is a highly successful consumer co-op with $1.8 billion in sales for 2011, allowing it to share $165 million of its profits with its 4.7 million active members and 11,000 employees. Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based cooperative dairy, generated more than $700 million in revenue for nearly 1,700 farmer-owners. From January through October 2012, the Journal referred (briefly) to REI in just three articles; Organic Valley rated just one mention. In combination, REI and Organic Valley appear in the Journal only as often as the Cavalier King Charles spaniel, a breed of dog that turned up in four entries in theJournal\u2019s pages this year.\nAdvertisement:\nFurther perspective on the coverage is offered in the way in which \u201chot topics\u201d are presented, and others of greater economic significance played down. Co-ops in the U.S. generate over $500 billion in annual revenues. The global market for smartphones is estimated by Bloomberg Industries at $219 billion\u2014less than half as large. Furthermore, there are 20 million more co-op members than smartphone users in the United States. The Journal, however, published over 1,000 print articles that included the terms \u201csmartphone\u201d or \u201csmartphones\u201d from January through October this year\u2014more than five articles for each piece mentioning co-ops (many of which, as noted, were about upscale Manhattan apartments.)\nThe print coverage of the Journal was analyzed by the Democracy Collaborative of the University of Maryland through the online database ProQuest. Although the assessment focused on the Journal, the nation\u2019s preeminent source of news for economic and business affairs, a preliminary review suggests that other national media outlets devote a similarly miniscule proportion of space to the exploding \u201cnew economy\u201d sector. This highlights the need for greater media exposure regarding important developments toward a more democratic, sustainable and community-based economy.\n}}

These are the stocks that make the most compelling investing opportunities and are definitely worth keeping a close eye on.\nSource: Shutterstock\nUsing TipRanks powerful stock screener, I set out to pinpoint five stocks that command the unanimous support of the Street. You can customize the screener settings to match your investment strategy. In this case, I selected filters for mega/large-cap stocks with a \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus from analysts and best-performing analysts. These are the top analysts with the highest success rate and average return.\nFrom the results, you can immediately see a pie chart showing the spread of analyst ratings on that stock over the past three months. This makes it easy to spot stocks with only \u201cbuy\u201d ratings.\nNow let\u2019s delve into these five stocks which have 100% Street support.\n\u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO)\nSemiconductor superstar Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) is leading the pack with an incredible 24 back-to-back \u201cbuy\u201d ratings in the past three months. The average analyst price target of $277 doesn\u2019t disappoint either given that the stock is currently trading at just under $250.\nFive-star Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach is very bullish on the semiconductor\u2019s outlook for the rest of the year. He says the Street is underestimating AVGO and ramped up his price target from $280 to $290 last month. The new price target suggests upside potential of 16.4% in AVGO over the next 12 months.\nBroadcom is a top pick for the rest of the year, according to Hettenbach. He sees \u201cmultiple catalysts\u201d on AVGO\u2019s horizon. These include Broadcom\u2019s $5.9 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRCD), which is currently being investigated by a U.S. government inter-agency committee.\nAs an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) supplier, Broadcom will also benefit from the upcoming and much-hyped iPhone 8. Analysts believe that Broadcom could see a 40% content gain in the iPhone 8 and might supply close to $15 of content per phone.\nClick to Enlarge\n\u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks: Delphi Automotive (DLPH)\nU.K.-based Delphi Automotive PLC (NYSE:DLPH) is a leading global supplier of vehicle technology. With seven straight \u201cbuy\u201d ratings in the previous three months, and predicted upside of close to 13%, this is one top stock to keep your eye on.\nDelphi has just reported very strong earnings results for the second quarter. Notably, quarterly profit spiked by 43% on the back of Delphi\u2019s increasing involvement in the driverless car race. And good news for investors, Delphi also raised its full-year guidance to $16.85 to $17.05 billion, up from previous guidance of $16.50 to $16.90 billion.\nCEO Kevin Clark said: \u201cDelphi delivered another strong quarter driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies. Based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our sales and earnings outlook for the year.\u201d Analysts are confident that Delphi\u2019s \u201csmart car\u201d strategy will ensure continued outperformance.\nFor example, on Aug. 3, Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache said he is impressed by how quickly Delphi is attracting new business wins. He raised his price target from $99 to $107 (15% upside).\nClick to Enlarge\n\u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks: Alibaba (BABA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has received 16 back-to-back \u201cbuy\u201d ratings from analysts in the past three months. On average, analysts predict the stock has just over 6% upside potential over the next year, but some analysts are much more bullish than the average.\nTake, for example, five-star JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth who is ranked #30 out of 4,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. He has the highest BABA price target at $190, which works out at close to 24% upside from the current share price. Why so optimistic? Anmuth likes the fact that BABA\u2019s core commerce is expanding from just \u201ctraffic monetization\u201d to the more valuable area of \u201cdata monetization.\u201d He says:\n\u201cSuch expansion not only allows Alibaba to tap into non-transaction-based corporate budget (e.g. market research, brand awareness, customer service), but also supports our investment thesis based on sustainable revenue/earnings growth. We adopt a sum-of-the-parts approach to value Alibaba, which yields a total valuation of $484 billion and a June 2018 price target of $190.\u201d\nClick to Enlarge\n\u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks: Align Tech (ALGN)\nSource: Shutterstock\nGlobal medical device company Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is soaring. Year-to-date shares are up from just $92 to the current share price of $169. Align is the manufacturer of 3D digital scanners and the well-known Invisalign transparent teeth straighteners.\nThe success of the company is reflected in its eight straight \u201cbuy\u201d ratings in the past three months. On average, these analysts have a $180 price target on ALGN, which suggests 6.5% upside potential from the current share price.\nTop Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Valiquette recently upgraded his ALGN rating from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy.\u201d He also upped his price target to $193 from $175 previously. Valiquette sees significant growth potential for Invisalign and says the fast-growing stock is cheap compared to its peers.\nMeanwhile four-star Roth Capital analyst Chris Lewis chimes in: \u201cWe view ALGN as one of the premier growth stories in Med Tech and continue to recommend the name as a core long-term holding.\u201d\nClick to Enlarge\n\u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks: Raytheon (RTN)\nSource: Shutterstock\nMajor U.S. defense contractor Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) is now worth over $50 billion. And the stock certainly has the thumbs up from the Street. Seven analysts have published \u201cbuy\u201d ratings on RTN in the past three months, with an average price target of $190. Even with prices moving higher, the price target is still 9.4% above the current share price.\nOnly a few days ago, five-star Argus analyst John Eade raised his price target by an impressive $20, from $175 to $195. He made the move after the company reported better-than-expected earnings results for the quarter and raised its guidance for full-year 2017.\nThe stock has benefited from the Donald Trump administration, which Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy says, \u201chas opened several doors for us.\u201d In particular, Trump has signed a $350 billion contract with Saudi Arabia that could include Raytheon\u2019s Patriot missile system.\nWhich stocks are the top 25 analysts recommending right now?

{{Stocks slumped hard on Thursday reversing early session gains after President Trump surprised the world by announcing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum of 25% and 10%, respectively. Following tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, Trump\u2019s trade posture is becoming increasingly hawkish. Trading partners aren\u2019t happy, with Chinese officials warning that they were \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the issue while European officials are threatening to retaliate.\nIn the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7%, the S&P 500 lost 1.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.3% and the Russell 2000 lost 0.3%. Treasury bonds strengthened, pushing yields down as the 10-year settled at 2.81%. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened along with gold and crude oil.\nBreadth was negative, but not overwhelmingly so, with decliners outpacing advancers by a ratio of 1.5-to-1. There were 170 new lows on the NYSE vs. 16 new highs.\nAdding to the pressure was more hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve, with New York Fed President Bill Dudley opening the door a little wider to four quarter-point rate hikes this year, while chairman Jerome Powell warned he didn\u2019t want to \u201cget behind the curve on inflation.\u201d\nAll of this is self reinforcing: The Trump tariffs will boost import prices, pushing inflation higher and forcing the Fed to tighten rates more aggressively.\nMetal stocks outperformed, obviously, with United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X ) up 5.8% and Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ: CENX ) up 7.5%. Automakers fell, as pricer metals will raise their production expense, with Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) down 3%.

{{JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest financial services firm, has paid $28 billion to settle cases brought by federal agencies in the past 10 years, most of them related to the 2008 financial crisis.\nYet the massive fines extracted from banks like JPMorgan for their role in the Wall Street meltdown have done little to deter other types of misconduct in the decade since, and one reason is lenient treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to our analysis of SEC enforcement records with a Georgetown University law professor.\nMoreover, the analysis shows that the SEC has come down much harder on smaller financial institutions for violations that generally pale in comparison to those of the big firms.\nOver the past 10 years JPMorgan Chase has been named in more than a dozen other cases brought by federal regulators unrelated to the financial crisis, including allegations of rigging bids in the municipal bond market, manipulating rates on foreign currency exchanges and charging excessive fees on credit card accounts.\nIn seven of those cases, all of which the SEC settled with fines totaling $2.26 billion, the charges were serious enough to trigger added, supposedly mandatory, penalties, including automatic disqualification from certain trading privileges on Wall Street and closer monitoring by the commission. But in every instance the SEC waived those penalties, enabling JPMorgan to continue business as usual.\nSimilarly, Bank of America, the nation\u2019s second-largest financial institution, paid fines to settle seven cases with the SEC since 2008, but each time received waivers allowing it to maintain unfettered access to financial markets. The SEC did deny a waiver in 2014 after the bank agreed to a record-breaking penalty of $16.6 billion for defrauding investors in the years leading up to the financial crisis.\nBut even in that massive fraud case, the SEC only revoked Bank of America\u2019s status as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which simply meant it had to get agency preapproval before selling securities \u2014 a paperwork requirement that applies to all other investment firms and that can delay transactions by a few days at most. In the same case, the SEC gave the bank a waiver from a more punitive, \u201cbad actor\u201d provision that would have limited its access to private capital markets for five years, though it did require monitoring of the bank\u2019s activities in those markets.\nThe SEC\u2019s practice of waiving penalties for major banks and investment firms, which received the bulk of the nearly 200 waivers issued in the past 10 years, contrasts with the agency\u2019s stricter enforcement record against smaller players in the financial markets.\nSince 2008, the SEC reached settlements in 565 cases in which the companies were either put out of business or disqualified from trading privileges. Nearly all of those cases involved smaller firms, our analysis with Georgetown University law professor Urska Velikonja found.\nCritics say the practice of routinely granting waivers to major firms dramatically undermines SEC enforcement.\n\u201cWashington has an arsenal to combat misconduct,\u201d said Bart Naylor, financial policy advocate for Public Citizen\u2019s Congress Watch. The requirement that serious offenders be automatically disqualified from trading privileges wasn\u2019t used effectively under the Obama administration, he said, \u201cand as far as I can tell the Trump administration isn\u2019t using it either.\u201d\nThe SEC declined requests for interviews about its enforcement record, as did trade groups representing the biggest financial institutions, including the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.\nSpokesmen for JPMorgan and Bank of America also did not respond to requests for comment.\nBut some financial industry experts defended the waivers as a necessary balancing act that protects the interests of investors.\nJ.W. Verret, an associate professor at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School and a former Republican staffer on the House Financial Services Committee, believes waivers are important for big firms, especially if faced with disqualification from certain types of participation in financial markets.\n\u201cWhy should the entire company and its investors be punished when a few individuals engage in misconduct?\u201d Verret asked. He said the waivers are appropriate \u201cwhen a small group engaged in the behavior and where the company had controls in place to try to prevent bad behavior.\u201d\nDavid Huntington, a former counsel to two SEC chairmen appointed by President George W. Bush, co-authored a 2015 journal article on the issue and concluded that the waivers are a \u201cnecessity.\u201d If the penalties were rigidly enforced, it could mean financial harm for major corporations, said Huntington, now with the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\u201cThe commission is not in the business of trying to kill businesses and put people out of work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is the sort of balancing that goes on here.\u201d\nBut Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who has written extensively on banking regulation and served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, argues that financial penalties alone don\u2019t provide a deterrent for future misbehavior.\n\u201cThey do it, they get in trouble, they get a consent decree, the shareholders pay the fine and then they do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cost of doing business that\u2019s passed on to the shareholders. The managers don\u2019t pay for their bad decisions, and then the company may go on to do it again.\n\u201cManagement isn\u2019t held accountable,\u201d Painter said. \u201cI suggest they should be.\u201d\nMeanwhile, small financial players involved in far less grievous infractions get little mercy from the SEC.\nA 36-year-old senior manager for Microsoft settled a case in 2016 with a penalty of $379,653 after he was accused of insider trading that netted him about $184,000. The SEC banned him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company for five years, handicapping his career.\nAnother settlement in 2017 involved a 48-year-old investment adviser in Connecticut who was accused of violating SEC reporting requirements and misleading clients about the value of investment funds. He was ordered to pay a fine of $150,000, hire an independent compliance officer and was banned from serving as a compliance officer at any firm for three years.\nThe co-director of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, former Wall Street lawyer Stephanie Avakian, described the agency\u2019s enforcement strategy in the Trump era in a speech last fall before the Securities Enforcement Forum, an annual gathering of financial industry attorneys, executives and regulators.\n\u201cWhile new leadership certainly brings about all sorts of change, one thing that will not change is the mission of the Enforcement Division \u2014 to protect investors,\u201d Avakian said. \u201cBut how we protect investors \u2014 specifically, what we identify as our priorities and how we allocate resources to meet those priorities \u2014 is subject to change.\u201d\nMore emphasis will be placed on the \u201cretail\u201d investment sector, which often means small-time perpetrators of Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud, she said, adding that financial advisers who charge hidden fees or steer clients to more expensive products will also be targeted.\nAvakian stressed that a focus on smaller players did not mean it would be hands off of the larger ones.\n\u201cThe premise that there is trade-off between \u2018Wall Street\u2019 and \u2018Main Street\u2019 enforcement is a false one,\u201d she said. \u201cOutside of the retail area, we have continued to address misconduct by financial and other institutions of all sizes.\u201d\nStill, several independent analysts said the commission is clearly reluctant to come down hard on major Wall Street conglomerates that manage hundreds of billions of dollars in investments worldwide.\nOf course it could be argued that with so much money at stake, stricter enforcement is essential, said Thomas Lee Hazen, a University of North Carolina law professor who has written extensively on securities regulation. Especially for the large investment banks, he said, \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to be held accountable, who is?\u201d\nBut the loss of trading privileges enjoyed by competitors could severely harm a big bank\u2019s bottom line, argued Robert Plaze, a former SEC deputy director now with the Washington law firm Proskauer Rose. One of those is the ability to make shelf registrations, where securities can be offered immediately with pricing set later based on market conditions \u2014 a streamlined process that can\u2019t be used if a bank loses its status as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer.\u201d\n\u201cThe ability to use shelf registration is imperative\u201d for big firms, Plaze said.\nDeep dive for data\nBringing the big picture of SEC enforcement into focus is not an easy task, partly because the agency publicly discloses only waivers that are granted, not those denied. But Velikonja, a law professor specializing in securities, figured out a way to piece it together.\nShe examined all 1,620 settlements filed with the SEC over the past decade \u2014 from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2017 \u2014 and determined that 762 of those cases, or nearly half, would have triggered automatic disqualifications from either \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d status or from participation in private capital markets \u2014 the bad actor provision put into effect by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law overhauling financial regulation.\nOf those, the SEC granted 197 waivers \u2014 meaning it passed on enforcing the automatic penalties in 26 percent of the cases.\nMost of the companies receiving those waivers are comfortably ensconced among the Fortune 500: the four biggest U.S. banks \u2014 JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup \u2014 along with Barclays, Charles Schwab, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others.\nThe bulk of the 565 settlements that did not result in waivers involved individuals or companies that aren\u2019t among the Wall Street elite \u2014 Bradway Financial, Matrix Capital Markets and Strategic Capital Management, just to name a few.\nWaivers explained\nSince 2005 the SEC has allowed institutions that qualify as so-called \u201cwell-known seasoned issuers,\u201d or WKSIs, to avoid time-consuming paperwork when offering securities for sale on the market. In more recent years, as private funds became a dominant source of capital formation the agency added an additional shortcut, allowing established firms to offer financial instruments to qualified investors without prior approval from the SEC.\nHowever, SEC rules require that if a firm commits fraud or other serious financial misconduct, those privileges be automatically revoked for up to five years. In order to get a waiver from that penalty, a firm must show that a disqualification from trading privileges is \u201cnot necessary under the circumstances.\u201d A bank might argue, for example, that if only a handful of employees were involved in misconduct, the entire institution should not be penalized.\nAfter the financial crisis, Congress included the bad actor provision in the Dodd-Frank law requiring the SEC to strengthen enforcement of the automatic penalties for violators of financial laws. The rules were updated in 2013 to require disqualification from the private capital privileges for any individual or firm with \u201ca relevant criminal conviction, regulatory or court order or other disqualifying event.\u201d\nBut Verret, the George Mason law professor, said applying the penalties without discretion across the board would be a mistake.\n\u201cSecurities enforcement uses concepts designed for individuals that are very difficult to apply to large multinational conglomerates,\u201d he said.\nThe fact that big firms get most of the waivers is simply a reflection of their business standards, he said. \u201cThe larger players have much more robust compliance systems in place.\u201d\nThose efforts don\u2019t always prevent misconduct, though.\nIn November 2009, for example \u2014 a year after the financial meltdown \u2014 a case came before the SEC involving JPMorgan executives who had paid millions in bribes to obtain a contract for managing municipal bonds to finance sewer construction in Jefferson County, Ala., the state\u2019s largest county. The bank officers then convinced the county to buy toxic swap deals that pushed the debt further into the future at substantially higher costs. The county\u2019s debt more than quadrupled to $14.7 billion over 40 years and sewer rates for residents rose by 7.89 percent for four years and by 3.49 percent in subsequent years; the county declared bankruptcy in 2011 and emerged two years later.\nJPMorgan paid a $25 million fine to settle the case, plus $50 million to the county and another $648 million in forfeited payments, according to SEC documents. And on the same day the settlement was announced, the chief of the SEC\u2019s Corporation Finance Division wrote to JPMorgan\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Avakian (now the SEC\u2019s co-director of enforcement), to say the bank would be given a waiver from automatic disqualification as a WKSI.\nThe same thing happened two years later, when JPMorgan settled charges of bid-rigging to obtain bond business in 31 states. The bank agreed to reimburse $51.2 million to affected municipalities, plus pay $177 million to settle \u201cparallel charges brought by other federal and state authorities,\u201d according to the SEC. The agency also granted JPMorgan two waivers: one allowing it to maintain its WKSI status and one enabling it to continue operating in private markets.\nAgain in 2015, when JPMorgan pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it colluded with four other financial institutions to manipulate prices in foreign currency exchanges, the bank paid penalties totaling $550 million and the SEC granted a waiver from disqualification as a WKSI.\nConsumer advocates argue the repeated violations demonstrate the SEC\u2019s ineffectiveness.\n\u201cThe misconduct on Wall Street will only be exacerbated by granting these waivers,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Naylor. Disqualifying bad actors \u201cis important for investors and consumers at large to be protected, but it\u2019s also important to deter recidivist behavior,\u201d he said.\nLarge financial penalties in settlements are simply passed along to shareholders, Naylor argues. \u201cMost glaring is that individuals are not paying any price, they\u2019re not being held to account.\u201d\nTroubled history\nA political debate about waivers began not long after President Barack Obama tapped Mary Jo White, a former U.S. attorney and Wall Street lawyer, to head the SEC in 2013. White launched an enforcement strategy modeled after New York City\u2019s \u201cbroken windows\u201d crime-fighting program, where even seemingly minor offenses were targeted to prevent larger ones.\nWhite said she wanted the SEC to be \u201can agency that makes you feel like we are everywhere.\u201d\nIn reality the Obama administration was aggressive in pursuing more cases, and was especially proud of obtaining big-dollar settlements in civil actions against the worst offenders in the financial crisis. Fourteen banks each paid more than $1 billion in fines and fees in federal cases over the past 10 years, mostly for actions related to the 2008 economic disaster. Five of them were forced to pay more than $10 billion apiece, led by Bank of America with $56 billion in penalties and JPMorgan with $28 billion, according to a 2016 report by Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks accountability in the financial sector.\nBut Obama\u2019s regulators also were criticized for not pursuing individual actors in the crisis \u2014 no Wall Street executives went to prison \u2014 even as top managers in the big firms continued to receive substantial pay raises.\nIn 2013 the SEC issued the tough new bad actor rules, providing that those committing fraud or other serious violations be automatically banned from certain financial markets for up to five years, unless the disqualification was waived by the regulators.\nThe following year SEC Commissioner Kara Stein \u2014 a new Obama appointee and a former aide to Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed \u2014 began objecting to a number of waiver requests, including one sought by BNP Paribus on the same day the French bank pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it violated U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran, agreed to pay $8.9 billion in fines and was hit with a five-year probation by the U.S. District Court. The bank, which provides investment services in the U.S., received the waiver in a 4-1 vote, with Stein the sole dissenter, according to Reuters. At the time, she declined to explain her vote.\nThen in November 2014, after Bank of America reached a $16.65 billion settlement with the Justice Department for its role in the financial crisis, Stein and Commissioner Luis Aguilar, also a Democratic appointee, held up the deal by objecting to the bank\u2019s request for two waivers, one allowing it to keep its well-known seasoned issuer status and one exempting it from a ban on operating in the private capital markets as required by the bad actor rule, according to the Reuters report.\nThe two dissenters created a 2-2 tie on the commission as White had to recuse herself because of previous legal representation for Bank of America\u2019s former CEO, Kenneth Lewis. The stalemate was broken when the bank agreed to have an SEC-approved monitor of its financial activities, but Bank of America was only granted one waiver, allowing it continued access to the private markets as long as an appointee approved by the SEC monitored its activities. The WKSI waiver was denied, so the bank lost its ability to sell securities without prior approval of each transaction by the SEC.\nA month after the controversy, Stein outlined her position in a speech to the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cThe commission can waive the disqualifications, but only if there is good cause,\u201d she said. \u201cThat standard must be applied with the utmost care.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to ignore what may be one of our most effective methods of improving compliance with the securities laws.\u201d\nAnother fight broke out in June 2015, after five banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup, pleaded guilty to federal charges of manipulating foreign currency exchanges. Each were granted WKSI waivers.\nLiberal Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts weighed in with fury. In a scathing 13-page letter to White, Warren described her tenure so far at the SEC as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d for a number of reasons, including failing to curb the use of waivers.\nWarren noted Stein had dissented on the waivers for the five banks because of their \u201crecidivism\u201d in violating financial laws. \u201cThese waivers apparently reflected the Commission\u2019s view that these banks deserved to continue to enjoy special privileges under the securities laws despite the deep breaches of trust and evident mismanagement displayed in these cases,\u201d Warren wrote.\nSome teeth needed\nOne of the lessons of the financial crisis is big banks need monitoring, said Hazen, the North Carolina law professor. \u201cInvestment bankers like any profession are going to have bad apples, and we\u2019ve learned that the cost of bad apples can be huge,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTraditionally the smaller firms tended to have done much worse things than the blue chip firms,\u201d Hazen said. \u201cThat changed around the turn of the century when it became apparent that they were doing a lot of the same shenanigans the smaller firms were doing. Once that became apparent, since 2000, it was no longer appropriate to say, \u2018Well they are blue chip . . . so we know they have their ducks in a row.\u2019 \u201d\nThe SEC could avoid the appearance of going soft on big firms if it followed a recommendation made by Commissioner Aguilar several years ago to grant waivers with conditions, such as independent monitoring of their activities for a period of time, Hazen said.\n\u201cRather than completely disabling a firm because of the bad actor status, you could say \u2018OK, you\u2019ve been a bad actor, you stand to be disqualified,\u2019 then depending on what the violations were, these remedial steps must be taken,\u201d he said.\nFewer waivers of disqualification as a well-known seasoned issuer might also have some deterrent effect, since the status is valuable to financial firms. \u201cBeing a WKSI is clearly an advantage, because it is a streamlined process,\u201d Hazen said. \u201cI think probably among investors loss of WKSI status could easily have a negative impact on the perception of the company.\u201d\nDisqualification as a WKSI would have a cost but would not damage a firm as much as some other disqualifications, said Huntington. \u201cIt means you\u2019re back in the old-fashioned system where you have to file a registration statement that is reviewable by the SEC\u201d before you can offer securities on the market, the New York lawyer said.\nThe paperwork costs could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it wouldn\u2019t put a big bank out of business, Huntington said.\nGeorgetown\u2019s Velikonja agrees. \u201cIf you\u2019re disqualified under WKSI, so what?\u201d Companies can still raise as much capital as they want, and pretty quickly, she said.\nDemocrats in Congress, including Warren, continue to urge more disclosure of enforcement actions by the SEC, though their prospects are not bright with the Republican majority more interested in rolling back financial regulations than strengthening them.\nRep. Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, introduced legislation (HR 3519) last year to add more transparency to the waiver process. The bill would provide the public with notice and an opportunity to comment on waiver requests and require the SEC to keep a database of all requests.\nBut at an April 26 hearing of the Financial Services Committee entitled \u201cOversight of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance,\u201d which makes recommendations on waivers of disqualification, the word \u201cwaiver\u201d was not even mentioned.\nIn the Senate, Minnesota law professor Painter worked with Reed, the second-ranking Democrat on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, on legislation introduced in October (S 1912) that would require companies to disclose exactly how penalties in settlements are paid.\n\u201cIt says companies should disclose when they get hit with a fine what the plan is, what percentage of the fine is to be paid by shareholders and what percentage is to be taken out of executive comp,\u201d said Painter, who is running for the Senate in Minnesota as a Democrat.\nCongress can\u2019t mandate that penalties be paid by executives, but it can demand more transparency, which can help serve as a deterrent to future misbehavior, Painter said.\nThe Trump record\nNear the end of the Obama administration in 2016, one of the deans of the hedge fund industry, Leon Cooperman, was facing a five-year ban and a fine of $8 million after being charged by the SEC with insider trading that allegedly netted him more than $4 million in ill-gotten gains.\nBut four months into Trump\u2019s presidency, the commission under Jay Clayton, the new head of the SEC, gave Cooperman a waiver of the automatic disqualification when he agreed to settle the case for a $4.9 million fine. The SEC is monitoring Cooperman\u2019s $5 billion-plus firm, Omega Advisors, which is operating without the restrictions that would have probably put the firm out of business.\nThis was a clear sign of the direction the SEC was headed in the new administration.\nSince President Donald Trump took office and appointed new, business-friendly administrators in agencies that enforce financial laws, \u201cthe SEC has filed more fraud actions against small-time players and fewer actions of any kind against large financial firms,\u201d Velikonja said.\nA report Velikonja compiled last November on the SEC\u2019s enforcement record in fiscal 2017 shows a dramatic drop in cases against Wall Street firms since Trump\u2019s appointment of Clayton, a former Sullivan & Cromwell partner. From October 2016 through March 2017 penalties levied against big firms totaled $2.4 billion, but the amount fell to $1.25 billion from April to September, the report said.\n\u201cIn the second half of 2017, the SEC has continued to pursue relatively small establishments for various violations but brought very few enforcement actions against larger entities, often referred to as Wall Street firms,\u201d Velikonja said in a summary of her report.\nA separate study issued in November by Cornerstone Research and the New York University Pollack Center for Law and Business produced similar findings: The SEC filed 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and subsidiaries in fiscal 2017, a 33 percent drop from fiscal 2016. But 45 of those actions came in the first half of the fiscal year and only 17 were filed in the second half, the study found.\nMeanwhile, penalties paid by public firms dropped from $1 billion in the first half to $196 million in the second. \u201cThe timing of this drop coincides with leadership changes at the SEC,\u201d the report said.\nThere also has been a steady decline in the percentage of SEC enforcement actions for violations that trigger automatic disqualifications under the WKSI and bad actor provisions.\nIn each of the six fiscal years from 2007 through 2012, more than half of all charged violations triggered automatic disqualifications, Velikonja\u2019s analysis found. Since fiscal 2013, the percentage of cases that triggered disqualifications dropped to an average of 42.8 percent each year. In fiscal 2016, only 31 percent of cases triggered disqualifications, and of those, more than a quarter of the firms charged were granted waivers, Velikonja\u2019s data showed.\nPlaze, the former SEC official now with Proskauer Rose, said the granting of waivers doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the agency is being soft on violators because the threat of disqualification from Wall Street privileges can be a powerful tool for a prosecutor. \u201cThe existence of this death sentence makes it much easier to get a settlement or the SEC can extract more in penalties,\u201d he said.\nHe also argues that SEC enforcement does have consequences for major firms.\n\u201cPeople do get fired,\u201d Plaze said. \u201cIf you\u2019re working at a big bank and you\u2019re responsible for this, you get fired and that has an effect on other employees down the line.\u201d\nVelikonja is more skeptical.\n\u201cChanges in enforcement against entities appear driven in significant part by the different priorities of Chair Clayton and his co-directors of enforcement,\u201d she wrote in her analysis of SEC enforcement in fiscal 2017. \u201cAs such, they are likely to persist until the next scandal, crisis or liquidity crunch forces a change in direction.\u201d\nThis report originally appeared in CQ Magazine.

{{It\u2019s in almost everybody\u2019s interest to try and gin up excitement for next week\u2019s major TV network upfront presentations: The celebrities are lined up, and the shrimp and booze ordered, in an effort to entice ad buyers to conditionally bet billions of dollars on shows that haven\u2019t been written yet, and ratings points that can\u2019t be accurately measured. Wall Street analysts say that CBS will be the big winner in light of its strong ratings. For example, Credit Suisse\u2019 Spencer Wang predicts this morning that CBS will record commitments of $2.8B (+4%), followed by ABC at $2.4B (+2%), Fox at $2.0B (+2%), NBC at $1.7B (no change), and CW at $477M (-1%). But for the most part, analysts are preparing to yawn. \u201cAs it currently stands,\u201d RBC Capital Markets\u2019 David Bank writes this morning, \u201cbroadcast year 2012/13 is setting up to be a \u2018boring\u2019 year for network TV advertising, with few surprises.\u201d He reflects the consensus view that advertisers are less likely to be stampeded into making deals than they were last year. The economy looks wobbly \u2014 nobody knows how the European debt crisis will play out \u2014 and overall TV ratings continue to slide. Demand from auto companies is robust \u201cbut likely will decelerate,\u201d Bank says. Meanwhile pharmaceutical companies have been standoffish \u201cand likely will continue to remain so for the foreseeable future\u201d with fewer new products teed up and some major patents due to expire. Also, this year AOL, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, and Yahoo staged upfront presentations in an ambitious effort to lure dollars that ordinarily go to traditional TV over to Internet video.\nThe bottom line: Wang says this morning that advertisers\u2019 upfront spending for ABC, CBS, CW, Fox, and NBC will rise 2% to $9.3B with unit CPM prices +7%. And cable will be up 4% to $9.7B, with CPMs +6%. Bank is less specific but says advertisers will spend just 1.3% more on the broadcast networks than they did last year, and 6% more on cable as unit CPM prices rise about 6% for each.

{{NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Perceived safe havens like utilities and consumer staples, often an afterthought in Wall Street\u2019s cascade of year-ahead investment recommendations each December, are emerging as top picks as stocks limp into 2019.\nGrowth-oriented sectors like tech or communications services have typically dominated year-end roundups of investment ideas. But an uncertain economic outlook and concerns the bull market\u2019s roar is morphing into a bear\u2019s growl have more Wall Street banks telling investors to play it safe.\nA Reuters analysis of 2019 outlooks from 10 major financial institutions found eight, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays, with \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on at least one defensive sector for 2019. That marks a big change from last year, when just two of those banks favored any defensive sectors.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, has moved its rating on utilities to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cunderweight.\u201d\n\u201cUtilities offering 6 to 8 percent total return with a lower level of risk might actually be a good place to be in an environment where volatility is rearing its head,\u201d Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, said during a recent outlook call.\nThe lack of analyst love for defensive sectors over the years is understandable.\nAppreciated more for their rich dividend yields than share price gains, the utilities and consumer staples sectors have turned in relatively yawn-worthy performances during the long bull run since the March 2009 market bottom.\nUtilities and staples are up 135 percent and 160 percent, respectively, versus the S&P 500\u2019s 268 percent gain. The tech sector has jumped 441 percent and consumer discretionary has soared 513 percent.\nBut defensive sectors have held up reasonably well for the past three months while the market has crashed around them.\nNasdaq is now in a bear market, having recently slid more than 20 percent from its record high in late August, and the S&P 500 earlier this week was just a stone\u2019s throw from bear territory.\nIn recommending defensive sectors, including the health sector in some instances, many strategists cited decelerating U.S. and global economic growth and the potential for higher market volatility.\nAnd geopolitical issues such as U.S.-China trade tensions and Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union could continue to weigh on U.S. equities in 2019, investors said.\nDefensive sectors may also benefit from an expected slowdown in the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases in 2019.\nBecause of their higher dividend yields, defensive stocks are seen as bond proxies and do poorly when interest rates and bond yields are on the rise, as they were through much of this year.\nBut the Fed is now seen throttling back on rate hikes, and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have retreated to around 2.75 percent, down by roughly half a percentage point from an early November high.\nRobert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas, recently added a utilities position to his stock holdings, the majority of which are in growth sectors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the income component, and it is actually among the few sectors that still has upside momentum,\u201d he said.\nCyclical and growth sectors are not entirely out of the mix. For instance, RBC Capital Markets has \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on consumer staples and healthcare but also on financials and energy.\nSome investors argue it is too early to jump into defensive sectors with economic and earnings growth expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace. Safe havens are also looking pricey relative to growth stocks.\nForward price-to-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 consumer staples and utilities sectors are now higher than for the technology sector, according to Refinitiv data. Utilities are the priciest they have been relative to tech stocks in 2-1/2 years.\nStill, even some of the more optimistic strategists say a sector allocation shift is warranted. Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. investment strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York, recently upgraded his rating on healthcare to \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\u201cThe economy is going to move forward, and I think the market is going to move forward, but they\u2019re not going to be led by things that are as cyclical,\u201d Golub said.\nWall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

{{NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as top technology names hit record highs and industrials rebounded from losses driven by trade worries the day before.\nHelping the move in tech, CA Inc jumped 18.7 percent and was the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500 after chipmaker Broadcom announced a surprise $18.9-billion deal to buy the business software company. Broadcom slumped 13.7 percent.\nFacebook, Microsoft and Amazon hit all-time highs and, along with Apple and Alphabet, drove gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\nThe technology index rose 1.8 percent, the day\u2019s best-performing sector, and the group is now leading year-to-date gains among sectors. The S&P industrials index rose 1.1 percent. Health care also gained about 1.1 percent.\nHelping the tech sector is the view that those companies may be more immune to problems in the trade dispute, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.\nBut also, she said, \u201cThe consensus is that negotiations will resume and there will be some sort of agreement between the U.S. and China. It could be naive, but that seems to be an emerging consensus within the market.\u201d\nThe United States late Tuesday threatened to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China said on Thursday the two countries have not been in touch about restarting talks and while it does not want a trade war, it would fight if necessary.\nBoeing and Caterpillar, among the hardest hit by the trade dispute, rose more than 1 percent each on Thursday, boosting the Dow.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 224.44 points, or 0.91 percent, to 24,924.89, the S&P 500 gained 24.27 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,798.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.31 points, or 1.39 percent, to 7,823.92.\nThe stock market value of Microsoft, which jumped 2.2 percent to $104.19, also rose above $800 billion for the first time, joining Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in that $800 billion club and putting it in line as a contender to be the first U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market cap.\nEarnings will take center stage Friday, when some big Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase, report results. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nDelta Air Lines rose 1.8 percent, and lifted other airline stocks, after the carrier\u2019s quarterly profit topped estimates on higher average fares.\nIn a sign that labor market conditions remained robust in early July, weekly jobless claims hit a two-month low last week, the Labor Department said.\nThe consumer price index barely rose in June, but the underlying trend continued to point to a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases.\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 11, 2018.

{{Apple offered a better-than-expected revenue outlook Tuesday and said its fiscal third quarter earnings and revenue soared, assuaging concerns that Silicon Valley might be cooling down after other technology companies recently disappointed investors with their results and outlooks.\nApple reported $2.34 in earnings per share on $53.3 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street estimates of $2.18 in EPS and $52.3 billion in revenue. Apple\u2019s earnings per share grew 40 percent from a year ago while its revenue rose 17 percent over the same period.\nFollowing recent earnings results from Facebook, Twitter and Netflix, each of those companies saw large, swift share-price drops as investors reacted to what they saw and heard.\nBut with Apple on Tuesday, investors cheered the results and lifted the Cupertino iPhone maker\u2019s shares about 3.8 percent in after-hours trading to $197.47 by around 4:43 p.m. PDT.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to report Apple\u2019s best June quarter ever, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth,\u201d said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. \u201cOur Q3 results were driven by continued strong sales of iPhone, Services and Wearables, and we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline.\u201d\nApple provided optimistic guidance for the July-through-September final quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, projecting revenue between $60 billion and $62 billion.\nWall Street had projected $59.5 billion for revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, according to GBH Insights\u2019 head of technology research Dan Ives.\n\u201cThe \u2018star of the show\u2019 was better-than-expected September guidance, which will be the focus of investors digesting results and a clear feather in the cap for the bulls,\u201d wrote Ives in a memo to investors.\nHowever, the prospect of a China-United States trade war cast a small, dark cloud over Apple\u2019s record June quarter.\nCook touched upon whether the wearable products would be affected by the prospect of a trade war between the two nations. Apple Watch was named as a product that could be hit with a 10 percent tariff coming from China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\nCook said Apple will be \u201csharing our views\u201d with the Trump administration to avoid a tariff war between the two countries.\nApple has worked hard to regrow its presence in China after it saw stagnant growth in the region last year. For its third quarter, Apple reported 19 percent year-over-year revenue growth in the Greater China region, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Only the Americas region saw higher revenue growth this past quarter.\n\u201cWe are optimistic that this will get sorted out,\u201d said Cook. \u201cThere is an inescapable mutuality between the United States and China. Each country can only prosper if the other does. The world needs both the U.S. and China to prosper to do well. We are hoping calm heads will prevail.\u201d\nApple\u2019s iPhone sales in the quarter ranging from April through June came in shy of analysts\u2019 forecasts. It reported 41.3 million sales of its main product, growing 1 percent from last year. Wall Street analysts had expected 42 million iPhones would be sold during the quarter, according to CNN.\nHowever, its iPhone revenue grew 20 percent compared to the same period last year, thanks to the more expensive iPhone X becoming the bestselling model.\nServices and other products like the AirPods wireless earphones and Apple Watch had the highest rate of growth for Apple this quarter. Services posted 31 percent more revenue compared with a year earlier, and other products posted 37 percent more revenue over the same period.\nRevenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphones \u2014 all looped in one category called \u201cwearables\u201d \u2014 were up 60 percent year-over-year, according to Cook.\nIn his opening remarks of a conference call with analysts, Cook focused on the growth of Apple\u2019s services sector, which has seen the largest revenue growth rates for the past several quarters.\nApple Music\u2019s revenue grew 50 percent year-over-year, according to Cook.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with how things are going,\u201d said Cook. \u201cWe feel great about our current services, but obviously we feel great about our pipeline, with our new services as well.\u201d\n}}

{{Growing tensions over the future of the Democratic party erupted at its fourth presidential debate on Sunday, as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed over whether Barack Obama should be succeeded with pragmatism or idealism.\nDemocratic debate: Clinton and Sanders in fierce battle over key positions Read more\nAfter a series of relatively cautious warm-up debates dominated by the former secretary of state, the candidates sparred over radical policy issues much closer to the agenda of Sanders supporters, leaving Clinton on the defensive over healthcare and Wall Street.\n\u201cEven when the Democrats were in charge of Congress we could not get the votes to do that,\u201d warned Clinton, after Sanders upstaged his rival shortly before the debate, by releasing detailed proposals of a plan to get employers to pay for Medicare for all Americans.\nA notably more aggressive Sanders accused her talking \u201cnonsense\u201d by claiming his plans would roll back the health insurance reforms of Obama.\n\u201cWe are not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act \u2013 I helped write it \u2013 but we are going to move on top of that to a Medicare-for-all system,\u201d said the Vermont senator.\n\u201cTell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee healthcare to all of their people, 50% more than the French, more than the Canadians,\u201d he added.\nEstimates by Sanders\u2019 experts claimed that getting rid of private insurance would more than compensate for higher taxes.\nSanders also went on the offensive over Wall Street reform, coming close to accusing Clinton of being \u201ccorrupted\u201d by $600,000 in annual speaking fees he said she received from Goldman Sachs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t take money from big banks, I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Sanders, to boos from the audience.\nHe was supported in his attack on Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street by an otherwise subdued Martin O\u2019Malley, who interrupted her claim to be the candidate that the bankers fear most with \u201coh come on\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s not true\u201d.\nThe one policy area where Clinton pitched herself as the radical alternative \u2013 and where Sanders was on the defensive \u2013 was gun reform. The issue was especially charged given that the debate was held just a block away from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, where nine Bible students were gunned down last June.\nClinton sought to push home her recent attacks on the Vermont senator, accusing him of voting with the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby on numerous occasions.\nShe pointedly raised the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d \u2013 which allowed the Emanuel AME shooter to buy a gun when his federal background check was not completed in three days \u2013 which Sanders voted for in 1993. (Clinton\u2019s husband, Bill Clinton, signed it into law, though she did not mention that).\nFor a candidate whose insurgency-style campaign has benefitted from pushing to the left of his rivals, Sanders found himself uncharacteristically accused of conservatism on guns. He tried to hit back by accusing Clinton of being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d.\n\u201cI have a D-minus record from the NRA,\u201d he said.\nOn Saturday night, just 24 hours before the debate, Sanders backed out of his resistance to legislation currently before Congress that would end immunity for firearms manufacturers from lawsuits from victims of gun violence. On stage, he tried to defend his 2005 vote in favor of such immunity by saying it was made out of concern for \u201csmall mom-and-pop gunshops\u201d.\nClinton\u2019s position of defending Obama\u2019s record on healthcare and Wall Street reform was also reversed on foreign policy, where the former secretary of state struck a slightly more hawkish tone over how to tackle the Islamic State. Sanders was left defending the president\u2019s more cautious approach.\nBill Clinton was also brought into the debate, courtesy the NBC News moderators. First they asked Hillary Clinton whether Bill would be leant upon for advice on \u201ckitchen table economics\u201d, were she to win the presidency. \u201cIt will start at the kitchen table, and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there,\u201d she replied.\nBernie Sanders releases healthcare plan hours before Democratic debate Read more\nShe added that she would ask for his \u201cideas and advice\u201d on economic policy, and use the former president as an \u201cemissary\u201d to travel the country looking for best practice to draw upon.\nThen Bill Clinton was invoked again, this time in a question to Sanders in which his previous criticism of the former president\u2019s sexual indiscretions was raised. In an echo of the way in which Republican presidential candidates have turned their ire on debate moderators for puerile questions, Sanders lashed out at Lester Holt and Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nHe said: \u201cThat question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street without being told how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton. I\u2019ve avoided that, trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.\u201d\nBut he did say of the former president: \u201cYes, his behavior was deplorable.\u201d\nDespite such diversions, the overall tenor of the debate was dominated by discussions of Sanders\u2019 policy proposals \u2013 a development that may worry Clinton advisers already made nervous by his momentum in recent polling, just two weeks before voters go to the polls in Iowa.\nIn the spin room after the debate, senior Clinton aides tested out their new attack line on Sanders \u2013 that he is making up policy \u201con the fly\u201d. The phrase was used with reporters by her campaign chairman, John Podesta, and echoed by the Clinton\u2019s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri.\n\u201cThe more scrutiny Sanders gets, people see flaws are exposed. Details matter: you can\u2019t make it up as you go along,\u201d Palmieri said.\nSanders\u2019 campaign manager Jeff Weaver rejected the idea that the surprise release of the senator\u2019s healthcare was an example of \u201cpolicy on the fly\u201d.\n\u201cHe said he was going to release his plan for healthcare-for-all before the Iowa caucus. We\u2019re having a big debate here tonight, it was a six-page release, plenty of time for experts on the Clinton campaign to handle it.\u201d\n}}

It is also streamlining its editing process, building a newsroom focused on mobile content and promoting diversity.\nThe total newsroom headcount will remain \u201croughly stable,\u201d it added.\nThe reorganization is part of the paper\u2019s WSJ 2020 initiative announced in October by Dow Jones & Co, the News Corp (NWSA.O) subsidiary that also owns The Wall Street Journal. The Journal, which News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch bought in 2007, offered all news employees a buyout as part of the plan.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s memo, Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker emphasized the need for more diversity in the newsroom.\n\u201cIf we are to thrive in the competitive environment newspapers face, we must ensure that we are hiring and promoting the best people,\u201d the memo stated.\nIn February, Rebecca Blumenstein resigned as deputy editor in chief to join the New York Times as deputy managing editor. Reporters and editors at the Journal signed a letter to Baker and Murray in March voicing concerns about the lack of gender and racial diversity among the staff, according to the letter reviewed by Reuters.\nIn November, the Journal folded the Greater New York section into another section of the print newspaper and merged other sections like Business & Tech and Money & Investing.\nNews Corp reported a 5.1 percent increase in third-quarter advertising revenue, partially offset by weak print advertising.\n}}
{{Back when Dennis Woodside joined Dropbox as its chief operating officer more than four years ago, the company was trying to justify the $10 billion valuation it had hit in its rapid rise as a Web 2.0 darling. Now, Dropbox is a public company with a nearly $14 billion valuation, and it once again showed Wall Street that it\u2019s able to beat expectations with a now more robust enterprise business alongside its consumer roots.\nDropbox\u2019s second quarter results came in ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations on both the earnings and revenue front. The company also announced that Dennis Woodside will be leaving the company. Woodside joined at a time when Dropbox was starting to figure out its enterprise business, which it was able to grow and transform into a strong case for Wall Street that it could finally be a successful publicly traded company. The IPO was indeed successful, with the company\u2019s shares soaring more than 40 percent in its debut, so it makes sense that Woodside has essentially accomplished his job by getting it into a business ready for Wall Street.\n\u201cI think as a team we accomplished a ton over the last four and a half years,\u201d Woodside said in an interview. \u201cWhen I joined they were a couple hundred million in revenue and a little under 500 people. [CEO] Drew [Houston] and Arash [Ferdowsi] have built a great business, since then we\u2019ve scaled globally. Close to half our revenue is outside the U.S., we have well over 300,000 teams for our Dropbox business product, which was nascent there. These are accomplishments of the team, and I\u2019m pretty proud.\u201d\nThe stock initially exploded in extended trading by rising more than 7 percent, though even prior to the market close and the company reporting its earnings, the stock had risen as much as 10 percent. But following that spike, Dropbox shares are now down around 5 percent. Dropbox is one of a number of SaaS companies that have gone public in recent months, including DocuSign, that have seen considerable success. While Dropbox has managed to make its case with a strong enterprise business, the company was born with consumer roots and has tried to carry over that simplicity with the enterprise products it rolls out, like its collaboration tool Dropbox Paper.\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of the numbers:\nQ2 Revenue: Up 27 percent year-over-year to $339.2 million, compared to estimates of $331 million in revenue.\nUp 27 percent year-over-year to $339.2 million, compared to estimates of $331 million in revenue. Q2 GAAP Gross Margin: 73.6 percent, as compared to 65.4 percent in the same period last year.\n73.6 percent, as compared to 65.4 percent in the same period last year. Q2 adjusted earnings: 11 cents per share compared, compared to estimates of 7 cents per share.\n11 cents per share compared, compared to estimates of 7 cents per share. Paid users: 11.9 million paying users, up from 9.9 million in the same quarter last year.\n11.9 million paying users, up from 9.9 million in the same quarter last year. ARPU: $116.66, compared to $111.19 same quarter last year.\nSo, not only is Dropbox able to show that it can continue to grow that revenue, the actual value of its users is also going up. That\u2019s important, because Dropbox has to show that it can continue to acquire higher-value customers \u2014 meaning it\u2019s gradually moving up the Fortune 100 chain and getting larger and more established companies on board that can offer it bigger and bigger contracts. It also gives it the room to make larger strategic moves, like migrating onto its own architecture late last year, which, in the long run could turn out to drastically improve the margins on its business.\n\u201cWe did talk earlier in the quarter about our investment over the last couple years in SMR technology, an innovative storage technology that allows us to optimize cost and performance,\u201d Woodside said. \u201cWe continue to innovate ways that allow us to drive better performance, and that drives better economics.\u201d\nThe company is still looking to make significant moves in the form of new hires, including recently announcing that it has a new VP of product and VP of product marketing, Adam Nash and Naman Khan, respectively. Dropbox\u2019s new team under CEO Drew Houston are tasked with continuing the company\u2019s path to cracking into larger enterprises, which can give it a much more predictable and robust business alongside the average consumers that pay to host their files online and access them from pretty much anywhere.\nIn addition, there are a couple executive changes as Woodside transitions out. Yamini Rangan, currently VP of Business Strategy & Operations, will become Chief Customer Officer reporting to Houston, and comms VP Lin-Hua Wu will also report to Houston.\nDropbox had its first quarterly earnings check-in and slid past the expectations that Wall Street had, though its GAAP gross margin slipped a little bit and may have offered a slight negative signal for the company. But since then, Dropbox\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t had any major missteps, giving it more credibility on the public markets \u2014 and more resources to attract and retain talent with compensation packages linked to that stock.\n\u201cOur retention has been quite strong,\u201d Woodside said. \u201cWe see strong retention characteristics across the customer set we have, whether it\u2019s large or small. Obviously larger companies have more opportunity to expand over time, so our expansion metrics are quite strong in customers of over several hundred employees. But even among small businesses, Dropbox is the kind of product that has gravity. Once you start using it and start sharing it, it becomes a place where your business is small or large is managing all its content, it tends to be a sticky experience.\u201d\n}}
{{I do not have any particular expertise in the inner workings of the Wall Street Journal newsroom, but this chart speaks for itself. It shows the number of stories the Journal published that were over 2,500 words from 2002 to 2011. Dean Starkman of Columbia Journalism Review created the chart and referenced it again today. (He used to work at the publication.)\nThe Journal is not alone in this trend at the big papers, as CJR has also shown, but its numbers are the most startling.\nFirst, the caveats. Of course, story length is not the only indicator of quality journalism. Second, some of the stories that got shorter might have gotten better in the process. Third, the newsroom at the Journal is obviously filled with strong writers and editors.\nOr as the WSJ responded when Starkman first published the chart:\nThe number of words in an article has never been the barometer by which the quality of a publication or its value to readers should be measured. Every article is reported with unique facts and anecdotes that are needed to best tell the story. We consider those factors, while respecting our readers' busy lives, when determining the length of an article. Our very strong circulation numbers suggest that readers think we're doing a good job.\nAll that said, the editors in 2002 were not idiots. If they thought there were 200 stories worth running at that length, it stands to reason that many of the 2011 stories were not better shorter. At least some longer, deeper, and more complex stories are either being shortened or left out entirely.\n}}
{{0\nNew clips from two highly anticipated awards contenders that (in one way or another) revolve around the American Dream have been released. A new clip from director Martin Scorsese\u2019s dark comedy The Wolf of Wall Street chronicles the first time that Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s hard-partying, drug-addicted stockbroker Jordan Belfort meets Margot Robbie\u2019s Naomi, who eventually became Belfort\u2019s second wife. The film opens on Christmas Day.\nA new clip from director David O. Russell\u2019s comedic drama American Hustle also focuses on a burgeoning relationship. It comes from a scene early in the film when the con artist duo of Christian Bale and Amy Adams first begin their courtship, and it nicely conveys the tone of the film. You can read Matt\u2019s review of the film right here. American Hustle is now playing in limited release and opens nationwide tomorrow, December 20th. Hit the jump to watch both clips.\nVia Yahoo! Movies.\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis for The Wolf of Wall Street:\nRevered filmmaker Martin Scorsese directs the story of New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). From the American dream to corporate greed, Belfort goes from penny stocks and righteousness to IPOs and a life of corruption in the late 80s. Excess success and affluence in his early twenties as founder of the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont warranted Belfort the title \u2013 \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d Money. Power. Women. Drugs. Temptations were for the taking and the threat of authority was irrelevant. For Jordan and his wolf pack, modesty was quickly deemed overrated and more was never enough.\nVia Sony Pictures.\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis for American Hustle:\nA fictional film set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation, American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that\u2019s as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving\u2019s unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Like David O. Russell\u2019s previous films, American Hustle defies genre, hinging on raw emotion, and life and death stakes.\n}}
{{So I was watching The Daily Show last night, and on came a clip spoofing the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. That\u2019s no surprise.\nThe twist came when host Jon Stewart noted that the movement had vowed to take over the park, \u201cif only to erect a monument to what was perhaps the occupiers\u2019 biggest challenge.\u201d\nThat fictional monument looked like this:\nThe bit got a good laugh, playing on the perceived messiness of the \u201cfacilities\u201d at the park, where protesters have demonstrated against the state of the economy, corporate greed, unemployment and other social ills.\n\u201cThey truly were,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cthe least toileted generation.\u201d\nPlenty of people have mocked the Occupy movement, but I\u2019ll be the fuddy duddy who asks: Did The Daily Show go too far by using the famous image of the U.S. flag-raising on Mount Suribachi?\nEvery few years, the iconic World War II image of five Marines and a Navy corpsman erecting the flag on Iwo Jima is altered for another purpose. Typically, doing so is blasted by veterans groups and many Marines, whose own Marine Corps War Memorial near the Pentagon replicates it.\nIn 2008, for example, Time magazine came under fire after it doctored the image to replace the U.S. flag with a tree for an issue about global warming.\nLast year, a British Airways employees union sparked outrage by altering the photograph to promote their cause during a labor strike.\nAnd earlier this year, a cultural group in New Jersey apologized after veterans complained about them altering the Iwo image to promote a parade honoring Indian heritage. The Indian flag was super-imposed over the American flag in that image.\nThose are just a few examples. The Daily Show wasn\u2019t promoting anything specific with their version of the image, but it certainly had an edge to it. It\u2019s a freakin\u2019 toilet swapped in for the American flag, after all.\n}}

{{Wall Street\u2019s backlash against 3D movies is growing serious. Just weeks after movie executives and investors wondered how well 3D films would do this summer, they\u2019ve begun to ask much tougher questions including: When will movie theater chains begin to cancel orders for 3D projection equipment? And could continued weakening in ticket sales force AMC Entertainment to shelve its plan to go public and raise as much as $450 million?\nDefenders of the technology are urging everyone to wait and see whether there\u2019s an uptick in 3D ticket sales for Paramount\u2019s Transformers: Dark Of The Moon, which opens July 1, and Warner Bros\u2019 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part II, which opens July 15. The films should \u201chelp provide for a more positive outlook\u201d for 3D in general and particularly for 3D technology company RealD, says Merriman Capital analyst Eric Wold.\nBut investors didn\u2019t appear to agree on Friday. RealD\u2019s stock price fell 13.2% to $20.90 the day after executives responded to the Street\u2019s concerns with talking points that simply urged people not to read too much into disappointing 3D sales for just a few films. RealD shares now have lost 41.3% of their value since May 19. \u201cWhile management dismisses a change in consumer enthusiasm toward 3D, the public is speaking and 3D is simply being overused with ticket premiums far too high,\u201d says BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield \u2014 who has a \u201csell\u201d rating on RealD.\nExhibitors also are losing patience.

{{When Injustice Becomes Law, resistance Becomes Duty. -- Thomas Jefferson.\n#Whilewewatch is not a film you walk out of saying you \"like\" or \"dislike.\" This is a film you feel. If you're not moved by the disturbing images on the screen in front of you, you're simply not alive -- or you're in the 1%. Spielberg routinely spends hundreds of millions of dollars, and several years of shooting special effects-laden extravaganzas, all in an attempt to try and tell the kind of story that will hopefully evoke the range of emotions this film stirs simply by pointing a lens.\nAnger. Shame. Disgust. Fear. Pride. Hope. Even laughter. Watching the film as it unfolds, and watching scenes of everyday people, from all walks of life, united in a common cause -- the demand for Change -- is quite an inspirational and moving experience, to say the least. It makes you want to run to Capitol Hill, grab every single one of them by their over-starched white collars and say, \"You're done. Now get lost.\"\nThe Declaration of Independence states: Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive..., it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.\nOffshore corporate tax loopholes, bank bailouts that became bonuses, Congress's legalized insider trading act, mortgage fraud, Citizens United, etc., etc. These are just a few of the poisonous elements our spectacularly flawed leaders have allowed to seep into the fabric of our democracy. And they must be abolished.\nSurprisingly enough, it's actually quite simple. You want to fix health care? Take away the luxurious health care plans our congressmen and women currently enjoy, and everyone in the nation will be fully covered within two weeks. You want to stop complacency? Put term limits on our representatives. No one in this country works for two years and retires with full salary and benefits. If it wasn't so horrific it would be laughable.\nOut of the multitude of disturbing thoughts #Whilewewatch produces, perhaps none is more unsettling than this:\nThe day after 9-11, when New Yorkers literally crawled from beneath the rubble and once again took to the streets of our wounded city, it seemed like everyone was your brother. Across the nation, the feeling was the same. Wherever you went, the sense of \"We're all in this together,\" was overwhelming. The entire country came together as one, both democrat and republican, to support our president, and everyone had everyone else's back.\nOWS is a direct result of the antithesis of that; it's what happens when we don't have each other's backs. Yet, at its core, all it's really saying is, \"Treat us fairly. Do what is right. Protect our rights and our children's futures.\" Seems like simple, common sense. It also sounds a lot like the rhetoric every campaigning politician spews forth, then, almost always, abandons. The harsh answer to Rodney King's poignant question, \"Can't we all get along?\" is, \"Yes, we can. But, unfortunately, it takes a catastrophe of global proportions to make that happen.\"\nThe one person who comes off the worst in the film, even worse than Rudy Giuliani, is Mayor Bloomberg. I liked and supported the mayor during his two prior terms running the city. I even supported his bid for a third. But, watching the arrogant billionaire sitting in a quiet town hall meeting and telling the press, \"If they really want to change things, they should stop standing around and go get jobs,\" left me speechless. The fact that the mayor of New York couldn't see the change as it was happening all around him, and the fact that he took thousands of people 'just standing around' to mean they were stagnant and lazy, caused me to question the mayor's character and motives.\nThe NYPD doesn't come off too good, either. Portraying the men and women in blue as the \"King's Soldiers\" was tough to watch, as my grandfather was a cop for forty years. Nonetheless, the shoe seemed to fit. When my grandfather retired in the late 70s, the department's idea of a grand send-off was a five-thousand dollar/yr. pension that died when he did, forcing my grandmother to live off whatever remaining savings she had for the last years of her life. In the past twenty years, improvements have been made to the police pension fund, and the way the dept. now treats its own upon their departure is much better than it was back then, yet I couldn't help but feel that, at any minute during the film, one of the bullying cops was going to exclaim, \"I'm just following orders.\" It was only a few years ago that the starting salary of a New York City cop was a mere eighteen-thousand dollars. I believe it's now way up there near twenty-five thousand, so if they're not part of the 99%, who is? And yet, there they were, just following orders.\nOne of the main topics of discussion at the film's conclusion was the mainstream media's mantra that the mission of OWS was \"vague\" and \"unclear.\" Nothing could be further from the truth. Alan Capper, president of the Foreign Press, read aloud several quotes from foreign media sources, i.e., London, and even -- believe it or not -- China, in which, it was clearly obvious the entire world's foreign media understood what the U.S. media has mostly chosen to ignore or feign ignorance about; that the mission of OWS is to promote and inspire real, democratic change in every facet of our political system.\nThe movement's mission was summed up best by Jesse LaGreca of The Daily Kos, who stated, \"There are many issues at stake; job creation, higher taxes for millionaires, bringing those responsible for the economic fraud perpetrated against the American people to justice, etc. This is not something you can get across in a ten second sound byte. This is a process of change that will take years. And it just started four months ago.\"\nA process of change, indeed. If nothing else, what OWS, and its national and global spin-offs, has succeeded in doing, is, it took a series of widely held, but somewhat scattered, ideals and beliefs and turned them into a tangible, living force you can actually touch and feel and be a part of simply by turning on your computer. Director Kevin Breslin should be commended for putting together a cohesive collection of the chaos. But, as he, himself, states: \"I just showed up and pointed a camera. They did all the work.\"\nSome of the film's lighter moments include: A man claiming he created his press pass \"at Kinko's\"; The line of protesters, whose job it was to film the police, referring to themselves as \"The 'Coparazzi;'\" A man with a paper mache Fox News TV camera stating, \"Fox News is fake news, so why not use a fake camera?\" And, several dozen occupiers wearing plastic, goatee facial masks, tipping their hat to the film V for Vendetta.\nThe heaviest moments come, of course, in the numerous scenes of New York's finest dragging, macing, and arresting the protesters for simply staying when they were told to leave. One person commented, \"We came in peace. The police showed up to riot.\"\nThe interesting long-term effect will be to see if OWS can turn into Occupy Washington and harness its power into choosing a candidate for the 2016 election the 99% can really believe in. If that happens, OWS will have proved an overwhelming success.\n}}
{{Globalization gives Wall Street a boost What do Google, IBM, Caterpillar and Intel all have in common? Besides making boatloads of money last quarter?\nWhat do Google, IBM, Intel, and Caterpillar all have in common?\nThe majority of their revenues come from overseas, and all four companies beat analyst expectations and announced solid earnings numbers this week for the first quarter of 2008.\n75 percent of Intel's sales are to customers outside the United States -- 50 percent to Asia, alone. Two-thirds of IBM's revenue comes from countries such as Brazil, Russia, and China. International sales of such big-ticket items as bulldozers and excavators accounted for 58 percent of Caterpillar's first quarter revenue. And Google, as noted here yesterday, depended on overseas ad-clicks for 51 percent of its revenue.\nAdvertisement:\nWall Street has been heartened by these numbers all week -- the health of these bluer-than-blue-chip companies is soothing fears that U.S. economic woes will propel the stock market into full-on bear-despair mode. The U.S. may be entering a recession, but the rest of the world is still growing at upwards of 3 percent a year.\nThe optimistic way to look at this is that the U.S. is no longer the only locomotive pulling the world economy. Other nations are shouldering the load and providing the demand necessary to keep the global economy chugging along. A more pessimistic take is to wonder whether we're just getting a breather while the U.S. slowdown works its way through the global pipeline. A lot of those chips Intel sells to Asia are installed in computers sold to Americans. The excavators Caterpillar sells to Colombia are employed mining ore that is then exported to China to be incorporated in products that are sold to... Americans. So it's still too early to say whether the global economy will withstand an extended American slump.\nA larger question would be how the success of these companies, and the ensuing giddiness in the stock market, connects to the livelihoods of average Americans. Globalization, this morning. is bolstering the bottom line for everyone who has money socked away in stocks -- whether via 401K, mutual fund, pension fund or other investment vehicle -- and that's an awful lot of people. But even while California-headquartered Intel and Google are going gangbusters, unemployment in California jumped from 5.7 percent to 6.2 percent, in just one month. IBM's hiring in Brazil and Russia, but not necessarily in Silicon Valley.\nTaken in sum, we would no doubt rather have companies like Intel and IBM still making a profit than otherwise. But it's also easy to understand how citizens of Ohio could be looking at a 250-point rise in the Dow (an hour before markets closed on Friday,) based largely on American multinational overseas sales, and wondering, what's in it for me?\n}}
{{The stock market is the most effective wealth-creation tool the world has ever known. But finding the best stocks is easier said than done.\nTo that end, one way to generate market-beating returns is to look where others aren't. So we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a stock that they believe Wall Street is overlooking today. Read on to learn why they chose iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), Healthcare Services Group (NASDAQ:HCSG), and Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG).\nShunning near-term profits for long-term growth\nSteve Symington (iRobot): Increased competition in the robotic vacuum space has Wall Street giving iRobot the cold shoulder. Shares of iRobot are trading 40% below their 52-week high as of this writing, including a more than 30% single-day plunge last month after the company offered mixed financial guidance for the coming year relative to expectations.\nMore specifically, iRobot told investors to expect revenue in fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.08 billion, good for growth of 19% to 22% and above estimates for $1.02 billion. But it also predicted its earnings would arrive in the range of $2.10 to $2.35 per share, below Wall Street's estimates for $2.70 per share.\nAt the time, iRobot chairman and CEO Colin Angle explained that, \"with the market accelerating in its growth and competitive pressure coming into the markets, we made a choice to double down on ensuring we had adequate dry powder to drive that top-line growth.\"\nAngle also believes that the consumer robotics industry is in the early stages of growth and the next three years will determine the \"true winners\" in the industry over the next decade. The vast majority of that near-term growth will come from iRobot's core Roomba robotic vacuum line, supplemented by its floor-mopping Braava bots. Later on, it should benefit from new market verticals, such as robotic lawn mowing.\nThat's not to say iRobot has fared badly in the face of intensifying competition so far. During an investor presentation earlier this month, iRobot revealed that Roomba still commanded a whopping 62% of the global robotic vacuum cleaner (RVC) market in terms of dollars sold last year, down modestly from 64% in 2016 despite the entry of dozens of new competitors.\nMake no mistake: iRobot's market share will almost certainly continue to drift lower in the coming years. But it still should command the lion's share, given its first-mover advantage, and the overall growth of RVCs and new bots down the road should mean exceptional growth for years to come.\nIn short, I don't think investors should fear iRobot's decision to consciously forsake near-term profits in favor of longer-term growth. And I think its recent pullback offers a perfect opportunity to buy the stock.\nThis company proves that boring is beautiful\nBrian Feroldi (Healthcare Services Group): While large consumer-facing companies tend to grab all the headlines, there are scores of great businesses out there that quietly deliver exceptional results for their shareholders. Take Healthcare Services Group as a prime example. This company provides housekeeping and nutritional services to healthcare facilities across the U.S. While its business is as boring as it comes, investors who have held onto this company for the long term have walloped the S&P 500.\nHow has the company pulled this off? The answer is that Healthcare Services Group has a knack for consistently bringing new customers into the fold while simultaneously selling more services to existing ones. That's a simple, but powerful, combination.\nIn recent years, the company's growth has been driven by the company's dining and nutrition services business. This division grew by 60% last quarter and helped the company post overall revenue growth of 26%.\nLooking ahead, I think that the company's profits are poised for double-digit growth from here on the back of margin improvements, a lowered tax rate, and continued growth in the nutritional services business. That's an attractive proposition for a company that's trading at 23 times forward earnings and comes with a 1.8% dividend yield that consumes less than two-thirds of profits.\nA gross overreaction\nMaxx Chatsko (Scotts Miracle-Gro): Consumer gardening leader Scotts Miracle-Gro just can't seem to catch a break from Mr. Market this year. After the company announced a slower-than-expected start to its fiscal 2018 and revised growth estimates downward, Wall Street didn't waste any time sending the stock sharply lower. Shares have dropped even further since then and have lost over 20% of their value since the beginning of the year.\nOn one hand, lowered guidance should be a red flag to investors. On the other hand, a healthy dose of nuance is needed.\nScotts Miracle-Gro revised its full-year fiscal 2018 revenue-growth expectations to a range of 2% to 4%, down from the previous range of 4% to 6% after its high-growth hydroponics subsidiary encountered headwinds that lingered a few months longer than anticipated. But management didn't touch its earnings per share (EPS) guidance. Furthermore, the headwinds appear to be short-term concerns (see \"months\").\nNone of that matters much to Wall Street, which has continued to overlook Scotts Miracle-Gro stock. Part of that is the fault of analysts, who focused a bit too much on labeling the company as a \"marijuana stock.\" Since slower growth from the hydroponics subsidiary disrupts that narrative, it's easier to blame the company for its own broken spreadsheet models. Makes sense.\nLong-term investors don't have to be straddled with the same insecurities. Scotts Miracle-Gro shares now trade at just 16 times forward earnings -- below the 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio -- and boast a 2.5% dividend yield. Plus, with so much focus on the hydroponics unit, I wouldn't be surprised if the core consumer-products segment reminds investors that the business is far from a one-trick pony. After all, the segment has grown operating income nearly 20% from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2017, with relatively stable revenue, thanks to doubling down on the strongest brands and strategic investments.\nLong story short, Wall Street may be overlooking Scotts Miracle-Gro stock, but you don't have to.\nThe bottom line\nWe can't absolutely guarantee that these three stocks will achieve outsized returns for investors going forward. But when we consider the steady, under-the-radar business employed by Healthcare Services Group, as well as the underlying reasons for the negative reactions to recent guidance from both iRobot and Scotts Miracle-Gro, we think the chances are high that they'll each crush the market going forward. And investors who are willing to buy now stand to be handsomely rewarded if we're right.\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nInspired by a recent Wall Street Journal piece titled \"Nine Rules Women Must Follow to Get Ahead,\" by Julie Steinberg, we compiled a list of eight other articles that journalists should stop writing because they are sexist, cliched, problematic, undermining to women, or simply bad. The piece that ensued, \"Nine Articles 'for Women' That Journalists Should Stop Writing,\" (Steinberg's article being the first of nine) seemed to resonate, with going-on 40 comments at the time of this post and 509 tweets.\nWednesday, Allison Lichter wrote a new \"rules in the workplace\" piece on The Journal's work issues blog, The Juggle, a response to the original \"Nine Rules\" piece, which clearly resonated as well: \"It\u2019s currently in the top 5 most-read articles on wsj.com, and, as you can imagine, provoked a range of responses,\" writes Lichter. (Responses include criticisms of it as a rehash of things known, disappointment about its overt sexism, and the point we made, that these weren't really rules for women specifically at all). Lichter continues in this new post by asking, \"Are there different rules for men and women at work?\"\nOf course, that's a rhetorical question, and if it's a defense of a piece heavily reliant on stereotypes and old-fashioned thinking about women \"playing ball\" in a man's world, it's not much of a defense at all. Really, women should do the work no one else wants to do, and pick up golf, and wear power-suits? Let's discuss, how are the \"rules\" different for men!? But maybe it's less of a defense than a tempering, or even just an attempt to keep the conversation going over this unexpected minefield (the original piece seemed so much a rote \"career rules\" piece that we wouldn't even guess it had been trolling). Lichter writes that men themselves had a problem with the piece, saying the rules applied to them just as much as they did to women. Another commenter wrote that women who wanted careers should marry men willing to be house-husbands\u2014er, OK.\n}}
{{Since it's release on Christmas Day, director Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street has been stirring up controversy for its profanity (it broke the record for most \"F-bombs\" in a movie with 506), and the Academy member who thinks the filmmaker should be \"ashamed of himself\" for making this R-rated drama. The story is adapted from Jordan Belfort's memoir, which charts his successful stockbroking firm Stratton Oakmont, where he made millions of dollars by defrauding his clients. The director himself sat down with Gold Derby for a video interview, where he offers his thoughts on the controversy, his relationship with the Academy, what he was trying to say with his use of profanity and obscenity and his favorite scene. Check out the video below, then read on for some of his quotes from the interview.\nWhen asked about his reaction to the controversy surrounding The Wolf of Wall Street, the director admits that it can be frustrating, although he is glad people are actually talking about the movie, one way or another.\n\"I go back to 1973 with Mean Streets, and then a few years later with Taxi Driver, and then Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino, and pictures like that, The Last Temptation of Christ. I have had experience with this sort of thing. I find that it's disappointing at times, it's frustrating, but on the other hand, the film seems to be about something that people can talk about. Some people may disagree, some may not, but this is an open dialogue, and it's exciting. That's exciting, whether you think something is well-made or not, this is a big issue, in terms of what it says about the country, what it says about our culture, what it says about human nature, and this is something that not only ourselves, but our children should be made aware of. I don't think that children should see the film, let me make that clear, but they should be made aware of the values in our society and our culture. It's interesting because people are really talking about that, I think. Yes, the film is a lightning rod, so to speak. Whether our intentions were to cause a sensation, I don't know about that. I was trying to show it profanely with a touch of obscenity in the same way that these people feel about other people, the contempt that they feel, in terms of money, in terms of the money culture. It's profane and obscene also, so I think why not just do it? Why not just show it and maybe provoke it to the point where you take the audience into that mindset and actually, at times, find it funny? This is the sharp edge of the picture, in a way. Yes, it is funny, but I've always said that it's not funny.\"\nHe was also asked about his response from Academy voters, who generally favor more inspiring movies, although he managed to win over the voters in 2006 with his gritty crime thriller The Departed. Here's what he had to say about his complex relationship with the Academy.\nRelated: The Wolf of Wall Street Red Band Martin Scorsese Featurette | EXCLUSIVE\n\"It's tricky because my relationship with the Academy has always been... The Departed was something that maybe came out of timing, I'm not sure. I'm not saying the film doesn't deserve it, I'm just saying that, by that point in time, maybe the way that film was made and what that film said and how we said it, maybe they got used to that from Casino and Goodfellas and Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. I think I had gone 36 years without an acknowledgment on that level, from the Acadmey. I think the first time I was nominated for Best Director was Raging Bull, bypassing Taxi Driver and Mean Streets. When Raging Bull was up there as one of the best pictures of year, I was excited, because it was a very tough movie. It's not for everybody, and I was excited it was on that level. When it didn't win the Oscar, and I didn't win the DGA award or any of that, what was I going to do? I was quite content to be able to make the movies.\"\nThe director also discussed the scene he is most proud of, where Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) on his yacht. What do you think about all this controversy surrounding The Wolf of Wall Street? Do you think it should be one of the Academy's picks for Best Picture? Let us know your thoughts below.\n}}

The Cougars are 11-15 against Pac-12 teams since 2000 including 2-2 against UCLA. Last season the Bruins rallied to pull out a win in the final minutes against BYU in the Rose Bowl.\nBYU at Michigan State\nSaturday, Oct. 8\n}}
{{All The Ways To Play Best Ball Fantasy Football\nDeciding to do a best ball league is just the first step these days since multiple sites now offer similarly-formatted games. Choosing the league and site that is best for you is important. As part of our on-going coverage of Best Ball fantasy football, I have put together a guide to a few of the different formats.\nThe FFPC Best Ball Fantasy Football Leagues\nThe FFPC, or \u201cFantasy Football Players Championship,\u201d offers best ball leagues that range from $35 to $1,250 in entry fee. The site uses basic point per reception (PPR) scoring that includes four points for a passing touchdown (TD) but also features a twist. Notably, thy tight ends (TEs) slightly more heavily, as the position is rewarded 1.5-points per reception. Furthermore, the FPPC includes kickers and defenses in their best ball leagues, which is not the industry standard like it is in true seasonal leagues.\nThe FFPC removes one fantasy point per interception and awards one fantasy point per 20 passing yards. On defense, six points are awarded for every TD, two points are awarded for every takeaway and one point is awarded for a sack (which are all standard). However, 12 points are awarded for a shutout and five points are awarded for a safety. Fantasy owners are required to draft twenty-eight (28) total roster spots with the starting lineup including one quarterback (QB), two running backs (RB), two wide receivers (WR), one tight end (TE), two FLEX, one kicker (K) and one defense (DEF).\nAccess premium NFL coverage 365 days a year with the RotoExperts. Season Long Draft Kits. Fantasy Football Projections. Best Ball Coverage. Dynasty Rankings. NFL Draft Coverage. Expert Chat. Betting and much more. Save 10% when you use the promo AMICO at checkout. Learn More HERE.\nBoth live drafts (with a 90 second time limit per pick) and slow drafts (eight-hour time limit per pick) are offered so people can choose their preference. Depending on the entry fee, FFPC leagues will pay out the top 2-3 finishers in the league, but they also offer double up satellites where those who finish in the top half win credits to two leagues at the same buy-in as the original league fee. Essentially, if fantasy owners join a $35 double up and finish in the top half, they can win two $35 league tickets if they finish in the top half. The exact payouts can be found here. In general, the FPPC is catered to those with slightly higher bankrolls and those who prefer leagues nearly identical to the classic format of fantasy football.\nMFL Best Ball Fantasy Football Leagues: Football10's\n\u201cMy Fantasy League,\u201d or MFL, is the original popular site for best ball leagues and they have chosen not to include kickers in their format. They use a standard point-per-reception (PPR) scoring format where passing TDs are worth four fantasy points but interceptions are weighted doubly as negative as they are in the FFPC (negative two fantasy points). MFL does not put a premium on receptions for TEs and defenses can only earn between 10 and -3 points depending on how many points they allow.\nOtherwise, their scoring format is similar to the FPPC on defenses, although safeties are only worth two points (as opposed to five in the FFPC). Roster size is slightly smaller, as fantasy owners will only draft 20 players, with the required roster spots including one QB, two RB, three WR, one TE, one FLEX and one DEF (and 11 bench spots). All leagues are slow drafts with an eight-hour time limit per pick and the ability to pre-select players for an upcoming draft pick. Entry fees begin at $10 on MFL and max out at $100 so these leagues are more affordable for those on a strict budget. Like the FFPC, MFL offers both top-heavy formats and 50/50 leagues, and their prize pools are as follows:\nMFL was the original site for best ball fantasy football, offers a variety of payout structures and avoids kickers, which the FFPC does not.\nDRAFT Best Ball Fantasy Football Leagues\nDRAFT\u2019s scoring is based on a basic half-point PPR scoring format and roster size is the smallest of the three sites with only 18 players total. Unlike the other sites, DRAFT offers daily fantasy games, so it was nice of them to keep the scoring consistent between those and their best ball games. DRAFT decided to completely avoid both kickers and defenses and focus on rosters where fantasy owners must start one QB, two RB, three WR, one TE and one FLEX. As is the industry standard, DRAFT offers slow drafts, but, unlike the other sites, DRAFT offers an extension between the hours of 2AM and 5AM. The example that explains the exact additional time awarded can be found here. On the other hand, fast drafts are also offered as well, and take just over an hour on average. Best balls on DRAFT range from $1 to $100 which means DRAFT offers the cheapest games of the three. Their drafts are the quickest, they offer the cheapest games and their offensive scoring format is significantly different from the others if looking for site differentiators.\n}}
{{Sometimes it takes awhile to realize how lucky you are. When I played high school football, my father never missed a single game in four years. My four brothers also played high school football, and of all their games, he missed just one. Years later, he can tell you exactly which son\u2019s game he missed, when it occurred and who the other team was.\nIt took me years to understand that this was more than just a show of dedication and support by my father. Seeing us play in these games really meant a ton to him, far beyond wins or losses or playing time.\nSo when I received the e-mail below from After Action special correspondent Maj. Roy Nickerson, it struck a nerve. You see, Maj. Nickerson is currently serving in Afghanistan with his unit in the 101st Airborne. Turns out his 15-year-old son, Alex, a punter and kicker for Adair County High School in Kentucky,was playing in his first varsity game last week. Roy Nickerson, obviously, was not able to see his son\u2019s big moment.\nIt\u2019s a harsh reality similar to what hundreds, if not thousands of deployed troops go through on a regular basis. While they\u2019re out fighting the bad guys, they have to miss their daughter\u2019s first day of kindergarten, their son\u2019s first little league hit, their brother\u2019s college graduation, or in Roy\u2019s case, his son\u2019s first varsity football game. It\u2019s one of the many sacrifices deployed troops make for the rest of us \u2014 missing the moments in their family\u2019s lives that we sometimes to take for granted.\nBut thanks to internet, the major had the next-best thing to actually being in Kentucky to see his son play: He was able to listen to a streamed broadcast of the game live online. Here\u2019s Maj. Nickerson\u2019s account, which perfectly tells the story of a proud father using technology to make the best of a tough situation:\n\u201cWe berate technology when it stops working and subsequently our relatively convenient lives become a little harder. Tonight, though, technology by way of the internet allowed me to experience a little of my son\u2019s high school football game. I woke early to listen to the Friday night matchup via streaming audio pumped out by the local radio station where he lives.\nThe broadcast was first-rate. The commentators were fantastic, obviously veterans of the local high school sports scene. They kept the analysis lively with personal stories and colorful anecdotes about the boys on the field and talked here and there about past heroes. The interspersed commercials advertising small-town restaurants, small-engine repair shops, and local banks reminded me of my youth growing up in Kentucky.\nI closed my eyes and I was transported to a high school football field on a hot, muggy Friday night in Central Kentucky. I chewed my nails and imagined the folksy pageantry of the first game of the season versus a neighboring county rival. Through my headphones, I could faintly hear the rhythmic chants of the cheerleaders and the occasional yell of an angry father or a screeching complaint of a mother. I might as well have been sitting right next to them. I noted the boys my son is friends with, some of whom I\u2019ve met, others I know only through their funny Facebook status updates and the pictures they post. Man, they get bigger every year!\nMost of all, though, I thought about my son\u2014 a sophomore starting his first varsity football game. I wondered how nervous and excited he must have been despite his perpetually calm outward demeanor. I wondered if he realized I was there in the stands as proud as any of the other parents watching. Thank God for high school football. Thank Him even more for the internet to hear a game all the way in Afghanistan.\u201d\nFor the record, Alex and his team won the opener 20-19.\n}}
{{If the Navy\u2019s still seeking help in its motto department, it need look no further than its academy\u2019s future football conference.\nThe American Athletic Conference has officially debuted its new logo \u2014 that\u2019s it on the right \u2014 along with a new website, which isn\u2019t shy about touting the league\u2019s impending success. Per the site:\nThe league is about to \u201cwrite a new chapter in the history of college athletics.\u201d\nIt \u201cexcels on every college athletic stage in every major sport.\u201d\nIt\u2019s \u201cThe American,\u201d for short, not the \u201cAAC.\u201d That\u2019s too close to the ACC, league officials say.\nLogos with the word \u201cAmerican\u201d will be available for schools to use on their fields, commissioner Mike Aresco told our good friends at USA Today, noting that Navy might not be excited to emblazon its gridiron with a gigantic \u201cA\u201d that looks a little like the Army logo.\nThe website also promises a stable membership, which could help bury lingering rumors of expansion. Further details will come July 1, when the conference officially launches. Navy begins as a football-only member in 2015 and would be the league\u2019s 12th team, if that whole stability thing works out.\nA 12-team league would be allowed to stage a championship game, which would be played the weekend before the traditional Army-Navy game, in all likelihood. In theory, Navy could win the 2015 AAC American title before facing Army for the Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy, then play in a postseason bowl game.\nThat might be getting a little ahead of things, but to be a good fit with this new league\u2019s image, the Mids could do with a bit of bragging about future achievements.\n}}
{{In the wake of new accusations of abuse surrounding Michael Jackson, a statue of the singer has been taken down.\nTen years after Michael Jackson\u2019s death, his name is circulating the media again for all the wrong reasons. Several men have come forward to say that Jackson sexually abused them over a span of several years. Their accounts can be viewed in a lengthy new documentary entitled, Leaving Neverland. The first part of the four hour documentary aired in the U.K. this past Wednesday and has since drawn vast public attention. In wake of the new controversy surrounding Jackson, Britain\u2019s National Football Museum has removed his statue from their property, according to CNN.\nThe statue has been a fixture at the Manchester, England, museum since 2014. The piece of art was originally revealed to the public in 2011 at Craven\u2019s Cottage stadium. It belonged to Mohamed Al Fayed, who had been close with Jackson. Upon removing the statue, Britain\u2019s National Football Museum replaced it with a less controversial figure. A statue of former Fulham player George Cohen now stands in its place.\nLeaving Neverland: Michael Jackson's music is being pulled from radio stations around the world https://t.co/PFW3y84GZh pic.twitter.com/iLCtwicby5 \u2014 Newsweek (@Newsweek) March 9, 2019\nThe museum issued a public statement regarding their decision to remove Jackson\u2019s statue.\n\u201cThe National Football Museum has made a number of changes to its exhibitions and the objects on display over the last few months. As part of our ongoing plans to better represent the stories we want to tell, we have made a decision to remove the Michael Jackson statue from display.\u201d\nThe majority of the Jackson family has refuted any and all claims made against the singer by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, both of whom claim to be former victims of sexual abuse at Jackson\u2019s hands when they were kids. The family even went as far as to call these accusations and others of this nature equal to a \u201cpublic lynching.\u201d The family also intends to sue HBO, the network that helped produce Leaving Neverland.\nMany diehard fans and supporters of the former \u201cKing of Pop\u201d were shocked by this documentary, which exposes the alleged egregious actions of a man many have idolized. Many have chosen to boycott the singer\u2019s music to show support for those who claim to be victims.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Jackson\u2019s name was embroiled in a public controversy. There was an incident in 1993 that many may have dismissed. During that time, a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson of molesting him over a time span of five months. He claimed that the singer provided him with gifts, bathed with him, and fondled him. For the duration of his life, Jackson declared his innocence.\n}}
{{Navy fans against the football team\u2019s 2015 move to the Big East conference almost had their wish.\nJoe Bailey, the conference\u2019s former interim commissioner, told the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit late last week that the league \u2014 which will have expanded its football presence to California, Idaho, Tennessee and Texas by the time Navy joins \u2014 \u201chas commissioned a study to consider alternative names.\u201d\nBailey didn\u2019t give a timetable, but with a study already underway, it seemed a safe bet that by 2015, Navy would not be joining the Big East, but some other newly minted organization with a name designed to reflect its coast-to-coast competitive balance. Like, oh, for example, \u201cConference USA.\u201d\nBut before online comment boards could explode with branding suggestions \u2014 some helpful, most not \u2014 the Big East\u2019s new, non-interim, commissioner spoiled all the fun: Before settling in to watch new Big East member Temple get defeated by Atlantic Coast Conference also-ran Maryland, Mike Aresco told The Associated Press that the name was staying put.\nOn the plus side, name-debate fans should have a chance to vent when the league splits into two divisions for football. Early suggestion: anything but \u201cLeaders\u201d and \u201cLegends.\u201d\nHow those divisions shake out could depend on further league expansion; Navy will be the 13th football-playing Big East member, which would result in uneven divisions and scheduling problems. Aresco seems to be leaning West as he seeks a new 14th school, fueling speculation about BYU \u2026 and Air Force. ESPN Big East blogger Andrea Adelson mentioned rumors regarding both schools in a recent blog post, saying little had changed to move Air Force out of its pro-Mountain West Conference stance.\nMaybe a catchy name might sway the Falcons? If you have a suggestion, leave it in the comments below.\n}}
{{Three decades ago, a group of insufferable yuppies gathered for the funeral of a friend who looked a great deal like Kevin Costner. This was the plot of The Big Chill, a movie that larded itself in sentimental nostalgia and Procol Harum songs and Bo Schembechler references.\nI don\u2019t think The Big Chill holds up particularly well as a film about the death of baby-boomer idealism, but I\u2019m also not sure that\u2019s its primary subtext at this point. Because I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that The Big Chill is now an unwitting metaphor for the downfall of the Michigan football program.\nBear with me, because I swear there\u2019s logic here: The characters in The Big Chill met at Michigan (director Lawrence Kasdan also went to Michigan), and so the university shows up as a secondary character throughout the film, including, most uncomfortably, on the T-shirt Kevin Kline wears to cover the crucial bits of his skimpy jogging shorts. At one point, as these talky ex-radicals hang around a house and dissect their varied miseries, they actually sit and watch a Michigan football game (this mostly involves Jeff Goldblum making wisecracks about the Wolverines\u2019 gaudy helmets and Schembechler\u2019s occupational stress). And then they step outside into the yard and play their own sloppy game of touch football to the rhythms of The Spencer Davis Group.\nSo what does all this self-indulgent angst have to do with the modern version of Michigan football? Well, if you haven\u2019t been paying attention, Michigan lost yet another game last week, 26-10, at home, to the University of Utah. The Wolverines are 2-2 this season, with their most consequential victory coming over the University of Miami (that is, the University of Miami that\u2019s situated in Ohio rather than Florida). Remove a flukish 11-2 record in 2011, the Wolverines are 32-35 since coach Lloyd Carr\u2019s retirement following the 2007 season.\nThey fired one coach, native West Virginian Rich Rodriguez, after determining his wide-open offensive schemes and lack of polish were not the proper fit for the university\u2019s lofty self-image (never mind that the man who built the Michigan ethos, Fielding Yost, ran a wide-open scheme himself). They then brought in another coach, Brady Hoke, who more readily confirmed to fan expectations, who had been an assistant coach at Michigan under Carr, and who would prefer to pound the ball on the ground.\nHoke is big and beefy and altogether reminiscent, at least in terms of imagery and philosophy, of Bo Schembechler. (It was Schembechler who established the modern platonic ideal of Michigan in the 1960s and 1970s, when the fictional bohemians of The Big Chill were occupying administration buildings.) But in his fourth year, Hoke\u2019s team is flailing and making inexcusable mistakes; in the offseason, Hoke brought in former Alabama offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier to overhaul things, but at least so far, nothing has changed. In early September, the Wolverines lost 31-0 to longtime rival Notre Dame. The Wolverines\u2019 current quarterback, Devin Gardner, is a talented and charismatic young man who appears so utterly discombobulated that he may wind up ceding his starting job altogether.\nAnd so this is now the most problematic era in the history of a program that prides itself on a headstrong morality, on the hoary symbolism of the \u201cMichigan Man,\u201d on the notion that Michigan stands above the muddy fray of college football while still managing to compete at the highest level.\nThe whole enterprise may have reached its nadir this week, when word leaked of a promotion: Buy two Coca-Cola products, read the sign in the Michigan student union and get a pair of Michigan tickets. A fury arose, because: A) Michigan tickets are, on the whole, prohibitively expensive, and should at least theoretically be worth more than 32 ounces of high-fructose corn syrup, and because B) There is a great deal of fan animosity toward athletic director Dave Brandon, a Barnumesque former CEO of Domino\u2019s Pizza who seems determined to either modernize Michigan football games or turn them into ADD sideshows, depending upon your point of view.\nAfter the Coke promotion went public, the Michigan administration disavowed it, chalking it up to a misunderstanding, but it still gets at the inherent problem with Michigan football in 2014: They no longer seem to have any idea what they are, other than a vision from the distant past. It\u2019s not just a Michigan problem, of course; on a larger level, the majority of the Big Ten Conference appears to be in steady decline. But Michigan is the behemoth, and for years, Michigan was the magnet for both high-level success and condescending idealism, and as much as I would like to engage in Schadenfreude at their continued decline, at some point, you start to miss them. At some point, you start to think about what college football might look like without all that snooty self-indulgence, and it gets a little depressing.\n\u201cWhere did Alex\u2019s hope go?\u201d says one of the characters in The Big Chill, in reference to their late Costner-ish friend, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if, at least in reference to the football program in question, that hope might not be coming back any time soon. I\u2019m starting to wonder if the nostalgia is all we have left.\nMichael Weinreb is the author of Season of Saturdays: A History of College Football in 14 Games.

{{COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Four unofficial visits on a cold night in 2012 for Urban Meyer's sixth game as Ohio State football's head coach.\nOne recruiting director charged with helping high school kids and future teammates get to know each other better.\nOne sideline photo.\nFour players.\nFour future first-round NFL Draft picks.\nOne unbelievable story of the greatest recruiting photo in Ohio State history, featuring Ohio State director of player personnel Mark Pantoni, linebacker Darron Lee, defensive end Joey Bosa, running back Ezekiel Elliott and cornerback Eli Apple.\nWatch the video at the top of this post to hear all five of the Buckeyes in the photo detail their memories of that moment and what it meant less than four years later.\nKnow that Pantoni was in Chicago during the NFL Draft, as a guest of Bosa's family, to see a finish to that photo.\n\"He deserved to be here, too,\" Urban Meyer said.\nIt's a photo that encapsulates all that a staffer like Pantoni can hope for, turning high school hopefuls into college football greats and NFL Draft elite.\n\"I'm just a small part of this equation,\" Pantoni said, reserving the praise for the players and coaches. \"If you want to paint the rosy picture, that's what we all envision. For it all to come true, it's pretty incredible.\"\nAll four players were already committed before that visit and they knew each other from all-star events and camps and previous visits.

{{In just the last month alone: A high-school football player in Massachusetts was reportedly suspended for one game after kneeling during the national anthem and quickly reinstated after a swift social-media response; a 14-year-old Native American girl in California who has refused to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance since elementary school out of respect for her culture lost points off her class grade for participation; a 15-year-old in suburban Chicago was allegedly pulled out of his seat when he also chose to remain seated for the Pledge in Spanish class; and in Collier County School District in southern Florida, a high-school principal said that students would \u201cbe sent home\u201d if they didn\u2019t stand for the national anthem.\nCharles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum Institute in Washington, D.C., said there has been an uptick in teachers and administrators seeking guidance for what\u2019s permissible regarding the Pledge and Anthem, which he partly attributes to the Kaepernick controversy. Haynes said that he carefully explains the law\u2014\u201cstudents have the right to opt out \u2026 [no one] can make them stand or punish them or make them feel ostracized\u201d\u2014but that sometimes it\u2019s a tough sell. \u201cThere's this feeling [from educators] that \u2018We just can't let them get away with that; it's disrespectful to America.\u2019\u201d\nAccording to Haynes, there are 45 state statutes requiring patriotic exercises in schools\u2014the Pledge of Allegiance, the national anthem, or both. Iowa, Hawaii, Nebraska, Vermont, and Wyoming are the only states without a law dictating the practice. While the vast majority of states require recitation of the pledge at some time during the day, in a small number of cases the specifics vary, such as California where it\u2019s only mandatory in elementary school, and Ohio and North Dakota, where statutes say it\u2019s optional.\nFurther muddying the picture is a World War II-era U.S. Supreme Court decision, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, that found it unconstitutional under the First Amendment to force students to salute the flag and participate in patriotic rituals. The lawsuit involved two elementary-school girls in West Virginia who, as Jehovah's Witnesses, were forbidden to pledge allegiance to the American flag because of religious beliefs. The 1943 ruling paved the way for students to opt out of reciting the pledge by establishing that government could not coerce people to salute or pledge to patriotic symbols, as it was a violation of their constitutionally protected free-speech rights.\nSome 70 years later, it\u2019s almost universally understood by school officials that they have to allow students to excuse themselves from these exercises, Haynes said. Still, the tension remains between knowing the law and obeying it. \u201cThere\u2019s always been an undercurrent about this,\u201d he said, noting that the resentment and pushback to the Barnette decision has lasted for decades; many school officials, Haynes added, \u201cremain angry about it and think it's an insult to the flag and to the country when \u2026 students dissent.\u201d\nThe national symbolism of the pledge and anthem runs deep, and not all agree that students should be part of this wave of protests. The conservative New York Times commentator David Brooks discouraged high-school football players from kneeling for the anthem in a recent column\u2014branding it \u201cextremely counterproductive\u201d and likening the act of standing and singing to a \u201cfoundational creed\u201d with a unifying influence. This expectation, however, can lead to a false unity, said Haynes, the First Amendment scholar, who cautioned that standing for the anthem or saluting the flag as sacred acts, in and of themselves, are little more than idolatry. \u201cThe irony [of stipulating that students stand] is that \u2026 the Pledge [and] the national anthem are symbols for the right to dissent, the right to exercise your conscience.\u201d\n}}

{{(Click here, if you are unable to view this photo gallery your mobile device.)\nSANTA CLARA \u2014 By rights, they should have been at their own game, the one they earned. The Paradise High football team finished 8-2 and was barreling toward the section playoffs before the Camp Fire torched everything they owned \u2014 their town, their homes, their season.\nSo the 49ers offered them an escape route. The team arranged for a bus to pick up the heartbroken players in Chico and drive them to the Bay Area, where so much wayward smoke preceded them. The Bobcats got their football game, all right, standing on the sideline during the national anthem of a Monday Night Football showdown between the 49ers and Giants.\nThis was no ordinary trip. The eerily quiet five-hour bus ride made that clear.\n\u201cWe all slept. They\u2019re exhausted,\u201d Paradise High coach Rick Prinz said upon arrival at Levi\u2019s Stadium. \u201cThey\u2019re all displaced. All of their homes have burned down. They lost everything.\u201d\nFlames swallowed Paradise whole as part of the widespread damage that reached 90,000 acres and destroyed more than 6,400 structures. The death toll reached 42 on Monday, making it the deadliest fire in modern California history.\nFor the football players, one of the toughest losses was a forfeit. The Bobcats had no choice but to surrender their Division II Northern Section first-round home playoff game to sixth-seeded Red Bluff High (2-8). Trying to show heart, Red Bluff officials offered to forfeit instead so that No. 3-seeded Paradise could sail through to its rightful spot in the Northern Section semifinals.\nBut there was no point.\n\u201cOne of my players put it best,\u201d Prinz said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I really want to play the game, but I lost everything I own and I need to find out where I\u2019m going to live.\u201d\u2018\nParadise quarterback Colby Cline said that 90 percent of the players lost their houses, including himself. The senior was getting ready for school Thursday morning when his parents told him to hold off. The fire was spreading, they said, and the family might have to evacuate. Cline had a predictable response to mom and dad worrying so much. He is, after all, a teenager.\n\u201cI kind of thought they were being ridiculous,\u201d Cline said.\nBut the team captain knows how to scramble, too, and soon he was helping orchestrate his family\u2019s frantic exit. \u201cWithin an hour,\u201d Cline said, \u201cthe whole town was on fire and we were in a rush to get out.\u201d\nCline and his family are now staying in a hotel in Folsom. Trevor Rickson, a linebacker, fled with his mom and sister and are now staying with his aunt in Chico. Prinz, the coach, said his house withstood the blaze, but even that news was bittersweet. Prinz explained, holding back tears, that every other house in his neighborhood burned to the ground.\n\u201cIt makes you feel a little bit guilty and grateful at the same time,\u201d he said.\nIn search of a way to cheer up the team, Tim Taylor, the Butte County superintendent, reached out Sunday to his old friend Jesse Lovejoy, the director of EDU Academy and the 49ers museum. Taylor asked Lovejoy for help getting the Bobcats to the game; the 49ers responded with tickets, transportation, sideline passes and a meeting with General Manager John Lynch.\nPrinz sent a group message to his players asking who might be up for a road trip. Almost everybody said yes. And when the 35 players, 16 cheerleaders and eight coaches boarded the bus Monday morning around 11 a.m., it was the first time they\u2019d seen each other since their lives were upended. Before they pulled out of the lot, someone from the community rolled up in a pickup truck and handed out sweatshirts. They were afraid the players might only have T-shirts to wear at a time when supplies are short.\n\u201cWe just rely on each other to keep each other up,\u201d Cline said. \u201cWe just love each other because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done all year. We\u2019re a great group of brothers.\u201d\n#49ers GM John Lynch welcomes the Paradise High football team, which had to forfeit its playoff dreams because of fire devastation pic.twitter.com/ESFDDh3Kcu \u2014 Daniel Brown (@mercbrownie) November 13, 2018\nRickson said: \u201cWe all just sat with each other and talked to see how we\u2019ve all been. \u2026 A lot of people were talking about how they got out or where they\u2019ve been staying. A lot of their houses have burned down. It\u2019s really hard.\u201d\nAfter the 200-mile journey, the Bobcats arrived in Santa Clara about two hours before kickoff and found a friendly face before taking the field. Lynch greeted the team for a brief pep talk, handling the moment with a deft blend of respect and humor.\n\u201cHopefully, being here tonight can make things a little better, all right?\u201d Lynch said to the assembled squad. \u201cWe need the team. You guys help us out.\u201d\nThen Lynch paused and pointed to some rebel gear in the crowd.\n\u201cFirst of all, you need to take off that Raiders hat,\u201d he said, laughing, before continuing. \u201cYou guys help us out and stand with our guys during the national anthem. Our guys are fired up for it. Stand with our team right out there. And, most of all have a good time tonight, all right?\u201d\nThe players waited in the tunnel in the meantime, at first shyly watching players like Giants quarterback Eli Manning trot by on their way the field. But soon they loosened up, high-fiving players and shouting encouragement as if it were homecoming night. By the time the anthem played, players lined up dutifully on the edge of the sideline. 49ers players such as left tackle Joe Staley, defensive lineman DeForest Buckner and quarterback Nick Mullens draped supportive arms around the kids as the Star Spangled Banner played.\nSeveral players planned on signing their game-worn jerseys from Monday night\u2019s game as part of a charity auction for fire relief efforts.

{{When Oregon hosted Virginia in a college football game Sept. 10, it was in the most Nike of settings.\nBoth teams wore Nike-designed unifiorms prominently displaying the signature swoosh. Nike's headquarters was less than two hours away.\nBut Under Armour, which relishes tweaking its much larger rival, used a back door to give the national television audience more than a few peeks of its logo in another example of how the Baltimore-based company finds creative ways to get exposure for its brand.\nDuring each of the game's 22 penalties, a referee in black-and-white stripes directly faced the camera to announce the infraction and on the front of his uniform, next to an American flag patch, was Under Armour's logo. The interlocking \"UA\" also appeared on the game officials' backs and caps.\nNicknamed \"zebras\" because of their uniform stripes, college football officials \u2014 referees, umpires, linesmen and judges \u2014 aren't nearly as riveting to fans as quarterbacks or receivers. But airtime is airtime, and networks almost always give the referee a microphone and a starring role, albeit a fleeting one, whenever a flag is thrown.\nUnder Armour is becoming a big player in college football, providing uniforms and gear for intercollegiate programs at 42 Division I universities. They'll gain two more in 2017, adding Cal and UCLA. Here's a look the schools that have partnered with Under Armour. (Sean Welsh) (Sean Welsh)\nUnder Armour has been zebra hunting in recent years, negotiating deals to outfit game-day officials working the Big Ten, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference and all the other seven conferences within the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football's top tier with 128 teams.\nAnalysts say it's a typical Under Armour move \u2014 opportunistically carving out less-traveled territory to compete with Nike, which is far more entrenched in the sport.\nBecause of digital video recorders and other devices, sports fans increasingly can skip through commercials. But referees \u2014 and the logos on their uniforms \u2014 command prime spots during games.\nLocal basketball players react to the new Under Armour Steph Curry shoes.

Every Division I FBS football official is outfitted in Under Armour.\"\nUnder Armour also sells officials' apparel, footwear and gear to youth and school leagues.\nNeither Under Armour nor Nike outfits game-day officials in the wildly popular National Football League. Those officials' pants, shirts and jackets are manufactured by Ripon Athletic of Berlin, Wis. The company's deal with the NFL doesn't allow it to display its logo on the uniforms.\nNike holds a contract to provide on-the-field apparel for NFL players. Under Armour has a much smaller role with the NFL: outfitting players participating in the league's annual scouting combine. Under Armour also gets mileage as an official outfitter of gloves and footwear, and players such as quarterbacks Cam Newton and Tom Brady and receiver Randall Cobb wear their products.\nOne analyst likens Under Armour's deals with college football officials to the strategy employed in professional football and other sports by Gatorade, the sports drink.\n\"Outfitting the officials is a complement to the UA player gear which, in the end, provides more exposure for the brand,\" said Auburn Bell, an adjunct professor of marketing at Loyola University Maryland. \"Essentially, it's going deeper against a very specific audience. An analogy would be Gatorade.\"\nGatorade is not only the official sports drink of a number of leagues, it also provides coolers and cups for sidelines and dugouts \u2014 akin to product placement in movies.\nBefore Under Armour came along, college football officials were outfitted by a variety of brands, including Adidas. Under Armour was seeking to expand its football imprint.\n\"Providing college football officials with game day apparel and footwear helps to increase the exposure for our brand on the field of play,\" said Nick Carparelli, Under Armour's senior director for collegiate sports marketing. \"We are a brand that was born on the field and is authenticated by being a part of the game in every way possible.\"\nUnder Armour founder Kevin Plank is a former University of Maryland football player who helped build his business by giving samples of his sweat-wicking, compression T-shirts to players.\nMaryland's conference, the Big Ten, said the decision to switch its officials from Adidas to Under Armour several years ago was made by the Collegiate Officiating Consortium, which oversees officiating for several conferences, including the Big Ten.\n\"We made the switch to Under Armour for the following business reasons: product quality, availability, pricing and our relationship with UA representatives and their executive team,\" said Bill Carollo, the organization's coordinator of officials.\nThe consortium's officials are independent contractors. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nIn 2014, Under Armour overtook Adidas in combined apparel and footwear sales to become the second-biggest sports brand in the United States behind Nike. In college football, Nike holds outfitting rights for top teams such as Alabama, Michigan, Oregon and Florida State. Under Armour's schools include Notre Dame, Auburn, Wisconsin and Maryland, and it recently signed UCLA.\n}}

The third part will be published later this week. Read Part 1 here. Read Part 3 here. Allen has become the preeminent high school football program in America, winning 101 of its last 103 games and rising to No. 1 in the national rankings. A star-studded list of transfers, including 2018 Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray, have helped transform the only high school in town into a five-time state champion. The largest school in the state has won 30 straight games, including last year's Class 6A Division I state championship. Not missing a beat, Allen is 14-0 this season, having outscored its opposition 706-225. A win in Saturday's state semifinal against Duncanville -- Allen's seventh straight appearance in the final four -- would give Allen another state-title chance. But there is a cost to that success, as talented athletes move away or become buried on the depth chart when they lose their spots to high-profile recruits moving into the state's largest high school. An epidemic\nLouis DeLuca/Staff Photographer Former Allen quarterback Kyler Murray led Allen to three straight state championships after he transferred from Lewisville.\nUniversity Interscholastic League rules prohibit students from transferring for athletic purposes, but with those regulations less restrictive than 40 years ago, coaches have called athletic transfers an epidemic that has become the biggest issue in high school sports. They clamor that social media, camps and skill-specific coaches are making it easier for athletes to be recruited and become \"free agents\" who end up at superpower programs. Allen, with a student body of 6,664, is one of the schools at the forefront of the controversy, but it certainly isn't alone. Fourteen schools have an area top-100 recruit in the Class of 2019 who transferred during high school. Allen led that list with four. Undefeated Duncanville, Allen's opponent Saturday at AT&T Stadium, has risen to No. 11 in the USA Today national rankings with help from Under Armour All-American Marquez Beason and his cousin, Zeriah Beason. Both are four-star recruits who transferred from Bishop Dunne before this season. The Dallas Morning News found that 74 football players -- including 30 from out of state -- transferred to Allen during the last five years, according to documents obtained from the school through open records requests. Last year's 16-0 Allen state championship team was led by four transfers who were top-100 recruits in the state. As a result, playing time can sometimes be hard to come by at a school with nearly 500 football players.\n===Read more===\nAllen ISD's model of one colossus high school has been scrutinized and criticized by outsiders both from an academic and athletic standpoint. But what's the real story? Read a three-part project from The Dallas Morning News.\nFierce competition Despite having nearly 100 coaches from seventh to 12th grades, Allen doesn't have the bandwidth to allow everyone to keep playing. Nearly all of the district's UIL sports are \"cut\" sports, meaning that once players hit high school, rosters are trimmed after a tryout period. Competition just to make teams -- much less play -- is fierce, and not just in football. The varsity volleyball roster for the 2018 season had 19 spots, including four freshmen. The junior varsity had 14 players, with four freshmen. Excluding the freshmen, that's 25 players from roughly 2,500 girls on the senior high school campus. Almost a third of Allen students participated in athletics last school year, according to Allen ISD. Those numbers were buoyed by football, one of the few sports that doesn't cut players. Counting JV and freshman players, Allen had 467 students playing football last year at the high school level. To keep so many players, there are 25 football coaches at the high school level, including 13 varsity coaches. Frisco ISD -- which has deliberately attempted to keep its 10 high schools between 1,800 and 2,000 students -- had a 44.1 percent participation rate in athletics last year, according to information from the UIL. \"There's no doubt that opportunities are limited, especially in the 'cut' sports,\" said Steve Williams, Allen's athletic director. \"And that's obviously the downside there. But if you can't find something to do over there at the high school -- you probably aren't looking. They offer so many opportunities for kids.\" Moving in, moving on Allen gained 34 move-ins for football for the 2017-18 school year, according to documents obtained through open records requests. Plano ISD, which has the state's second-, third- and fourth-largest high schools but hasn't won a football state title since 1994, averaged fewer than five football move-ins per school over the last five school years. \"If you're playing at a high level, like the Allen Eagles do, and you play in front of a crowd of 15,000 to 18,000 at home games ... what kid wouldn't want to play in that environment?\" said Tom Westerberg, who won four state championships and had a record of 147-17 as Allen's coach from 2004 to 2015 before leaving to become the coach and athletic director at Mont Belvieu Barbers Hill, a 5A school about 30 minutes east of Houston. \"Those kids move into Allen. You don't know those guys, nor do you go out and recruit them. Those kids are gravitating toward teams that win a lot. If they think they can play at that level, boy, they show up.\" The benefits of playing at Allen are obvious. Allen has won 94 percent of its games since 2008, going 153-9. Allen has been ranked in the top five nationally seven straight seasons, 18 players from the 2017 team signed with colleges, and the Eagles play in a $59.6 million stadium. \"A lot of people complain about it and say we buy our championships. But we work hard, and we do it for the community,\" said second-team all-state running back Brock Sturges, who ran for 2,167 yards as a senior last season after transferring to Allen from Katy Seven Lakes before his junior year. Last year was the fourth straight season that Allen's top two rushers were move-ins. Two players who transferred in are among the area's top 20 recruits in the Class of 2019: quarterback Grant Tisdale and Oklahoma State defensive line pledge Jayden Jernigan, a transfer from Parish Episcopal. Senior All-American offensive lineman EJ Ndoma-Ogar, another top-20 recruit, said he transferred from Allen to national power IMG Academy in Florida because he wanted more competition to help him improve. The Oklahoma pledge transferred back to Allen before his junior year when he got homesick. \"I think that people want to give their kids the best opportunity to be successful, whether it be education or athletics,\" Allen coach Terry Gambill said. \"When you come to Allen High School, you're going to be successful because of the education you're getting and the way the school system is set up.\" This is the seventh straight season that Allen's starting quarterback is a player who transferred into the system. Murray, who transferred from Lewisville, was followed by Seth Green (from Woodbury East Ridge in Minnesota), Mitchell Jonke (from Lovejoy) and Tisdale. \"When Kyler moved in, the grades beneath him just kind of cleared out,\" said Ian Davis, who as a senior was the backup to Tisdale last season. \"I was the only quarterback in my class at Allen.\" \"Grant Tisdale, he came in playing quarterback. There is a little bit, I don't want to say animosity, but you're competing with the guy. You're like, 'OK, he moved in and wants to take my spot and this is where I'm from, this is mine.' But if he's better than you and he puts the work in, you can't complain.\"\nAnswering the critics No significant Allen move-ins have been ruled ineligible for transferring for athletic purposes. But on social media, critics are quick to proclaim that Allen has an unfair advantage. \"I think we are in a society now that people sometimes talk about things that they don't even have a clue about,\" Gambill said. \"My response to people when they want to say things like that is, I think there are bigger problems and issues in our world and our society than worrying about something like that. \"We live in a great country that gives people a great opportunity to get an education. Where somebody wants to live, that's up to them.\" Former players complain that quality athletes get left behind or overlooked. Just look at Miles Thompson. The Hendrix (Ark.) College quarterback was a preseason NCAA Division III All-American this year. It took leaving Allen, where he would have been stuck behind Murray, for Thompson to get an opportunity to play college football. Davis won a state title as a senior at Allen last year, but his only opportunity to play in college was as a preferred walk-on at Stephen F. Austin. Davis threw 22 passes in his lone year on varsity while backing up Tisdale, an Ole Miss pledge who transferred to Allen from Plano ISD before his freshman year.\nSteve Hamm/Special Contributor Former Allen tight end/H-back Andrew Magee lamented the fact that some of his teammates had to ride the bench at Allen despite being talented enough to play elsewhere.\n\"[Davis] was a freaking stud,\" said Andrew Magee, a senior tight end/H-back at Allen last season. \"He was in the same boat as me, played JV until his senior year. Obviously, he wasn't going to get that starting job over Tisdale. I think if he was in another setting or at a different school, he would have had more opportunities. \"It is tough seeing guys that you know could play at other places that don't get to play at Allen.\" Thompson, a quarterback with zero stars on his recruiting page, left Allen after his freshman year and left Plano East during his junior year. He graduated with a class of 26 students at First Baptist Academy, and after he was first-team all-state for the Dallas private school, he received an offer from Hendrix. \"I don't regret anything,\" Thompson said. At Allen, Thompson would have competed for playing time with Murray, who went 42-0 as a starter in high school. At Plano East, Thompson had to compete with Miklo Smalls, who signed with Rice. \"I wanted a smaller-school atmosphere, and I wanted to help better my chances to play college football,\" Thompson said. \"The competition at Allen and schools like that is fierce. If you want to go play somewhere, you have got to be able to get film on tape and you have to be on the field. You have to do what you have to do.\" Those who lost roster spots to transfers at Allen didn't always stick around. \"You have kids moving in from everywhere in the country, just because they hear about Allen,\" said Jack Fee, who was a senior on the 2017 team. \"Many of my friends I had growing up, they moved out because Allen is football, and they don't think they have a chance, so they will go to Lovejoy or the McKinney schools or the Plano schools. \"I was given the option to move a lot, but I wanted to stay here and try to prove that I deserved playing time. My senior year, I finally got that.\"\nFee is now a running back at NCAA Division III Trinity University, but Davis is attending SFA as strictly a student after turning down a preferred walk-on offer. Davis grew up in Allen and was the only senior quarterback on the varsity last year, but the starting job went to Tisdale, rated the 14th-best dual-threat quarterback in the nation by 247Sports.com.\n\"I feel like I could have had a lot more opportunities after high school if I had been allowed more playing time,\" Davis said. Magee walked on at Big 12 champion Oklahoma after his only scholarship offers were from smaller colleges. \"I was JV as a junior, and that can be really frustrating,\" Magee said. \"It causes some players to maybe want to quit. \"There is a lot of pressure to play at Allen, but in the end it makes us work harder. In the town, the standard is winning state, so if you don't win state, you're kind of letting down the city.\"\nNot just at Allen\nAshley Landis/Staff Photographer Former Lancaster standout Elijah Thomas played at three high schools, helping lead Lancaster to a state title in 2015.\nThe UIL, the state's governing body for public schools, handles about 10,000 high school transfers every year, and coaches worry about a free-agent mentality becoming pervasive. When The Dallas Morning News surveyed area coaches in 2015, 36 percent thought recruiting happens quite a bit. It's easier to become a powerhouse with transfers now than it was from 1933 until 1981, when non-senior transfers automatically had to sit out a year and senior transfers had to wait 30 days to play. For a transfer to be ruled ineligible now, the coach at their previous school, a district executive committee and the UIL's state executive committee would all have to think they transferred for athletic purposes. To suggest that high-profile transfers are unique to Allen -- or strictly tied to football -- is far from the case. Flower Mound Marcus' Marcus Smart (now with the Boston Celtics), Plano West's Tyler Davis and Lancaster's Elijah Thomas were top-50 national recruits who won state championships in basketball after making waves when they transferred. Davis won state as a senior in 2015 after being ineligible for varsity competition as a junior because he was ruled to have transferred for athletic purposes. Thomas was at his third high school when he won state in 2015 and said in a postgame interview that \"coming to Lancaster was the best decision I ever made.\" Working for it Plano was the Allen of its day, winning seven football state titles from 1965 to 1994. But Plano East opened in 1981 and Plano West followed in 1999, and Plano ISD hasn't won a football state championship since its third senior high school opened. \"We don't get much negative feedback on the structure of the school district,\" Plano ISD athletic director Gerald Brence said. \"Sometimes the fans get frustrated, and I do too. But then you have a lot of teams that do real well. [The biggest benefit is] they've got a school close to where they live.\"\nHad he stayed in Plano ISD, Tisdale would have attended Plano West, the state's second-largest high school. Plano West is 4-36 the last four years and has lost 26 in a row. Tisdale was Allen's third-string quarterback as a freshman and the backup as a sophomore. He has accounted for 87 touchdowns in two seasons as the starter. \"When you come to Allen, you're really going to have to work for it. It's run like a small college. Nothing is going to be handed to you,\" Tisdale said. \"I really wanted to play, but it helped me with my preparation of what it takes to be a starting quarterback.\" Opposing coaches know what they are up against. \"Anytime you are a one-high school town, I think you do have an advantage,\" said Plano East coach Joey McCullough, whose team has lost 19 in a row to Allen. \"Those kids are coming up under one system. We have to deal with depth issues. We have to worry a little bit more with injuries. I'm not making excuses, but a lot of people would love to be in a one-school town.\" Staff writer Corbett Smith contributed to this report.

{{Networks say the changes will cause \"zero impact on revenue.\"\nThe number of commercial breaks during NFL games has often bothered viewers \u2014 and not just those sprinting to the bathroom or kitchen. To wit, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell this year wrote a letter to fans addressing the barrage of ad breaks that follow touchdowns and subsequent kickoffs, commiserating, \"I hate that, too.\"\nGood news: Goodell will deliver on his promise to streamline the at-home viewing experience this season. The solution is to decrease the number of breaks to four per quarter, down from the previous 5-6-5-5 pattern, which often forced networks to squeeze more than a half-dozen breaks into a 15-minute playing period. That meant eight or nine minutes away from game action. Sports media expert Marc Ganis, president of the marketing firm Sportscorp, tells THR: \"That's way too much, especially when the games weren't compelling. Fans changed the channel or got up and did something else.\"\nThe league and its broadcast partners \u2014 CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN \u2014 all insist that the move has nothing to do with the NFL's 9 percent drop in ratings in 2016. \"Everybody assumes the changes were because of the dip in ratings last season, but [plans] had been going on for over a year,\" says a league spokesperson. \"Our best practice is to see what can be improved in good times and bad.\"\nThe networks say the changes give them more flexibility and breathing room. In the past, a long 10-minute drive may have forced a break or two to spill into the next quarter, creating a logjam that frustrated fans and advertisers alike. Another benefit of less frequent breaks is more space between rival brands' spots, notes Neil Mulcahy, Fox Sports executive vp ad sales: \"The clients are happy with the changes because they'll provide more separation between competitors.\"\nCBS chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves told CNBC in July that the changes weren't expected to hurt the bottom line. Roughly the same number of ads will be sold; the new breaks will run 2:20 each (up from 1:50).\nGanis agrees, noting that the number of ads will be the same and that ratings will be determined by matchups: \"At the moment, I expect zero impact on revenue.\"\nThis story first appeared in the Aug. 2 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

For an opener, it's a tough one.\"\nWhite said junior Matt Gane will likely start at quarterback for Friday's opener.\nEdison has won its last seven season openers dating to 2005.\n*\nFountain Valley vs. Foothill\n(at Tustin High, 7 p.m.)\nFountain Valley begins its first season under veteran Coach Ray Fenton with a tough opener against Foothill.\n\"That's a tough way to get going, but I think that there's no better way to start the season than against a team of Foothill's caliber,\" Fenton said. \"This game will show us where we stand.\"\nFoothill last year went 10-3 and reached the Southwest Division semifinals where it was edged, 22-16, by Edison. The Knights return several key players from that 10-win team including wide receiver Bobby Okereke, who has committed to Stanford, and inside linebacker Robert Forkey. One key spot the Knights must fill is at quarterback where then-senior Jack Gilchrist threw for 2,442 yards and 22 touchdowns last year.\n\"They are a very good team,\" Fenton said of the Knights who enter the season ranked No. 4. \"They are talented and play hard. They have a standout wide receiver (Okereke) and that inside linebacker (Forkey) is really aggressive.\"\nLike Foothill, Fountain Valley is starting out new at quarterback. Fenton said the rotation includes Scott Schultz, a backup to starter Chris d'Entremont last year, and Travis Hood, a transfer from Buena Park.\nThe Barons scrimmaged two-time defending Southern Division champion Corona del Mar Friday.\n\"The kids are still learning about us, and we are still learning about them,\" Fenton said of the adjustments between his coaching staff and his initial team. \"Overall, though, I think we are ready to go.\"\n*\nMarina vs. El Rancho\n(at El Rancho High, 7 p.m.)\nMarina and Pico Rivera El Rancho square off for the second-straight year in the season opener for both teams.\nThe Vikings won three games last year and dropped a close, 28-23 game to the Dons last year.\nEl Rancho went 5-5 in 2012. The Dons last year were led by senior quarterback Joe Sanchez, who amassed 3,184 total yards, and senior running back Johnny Garcia who had 1,556 total yards. They do return their top receiver, Javier Carrillo (658 yards).\n*\nArrowhead Christian Academy vs. Brethren Christian\n(at Ocean View High, 7 p.m.)\nBrethren Christian opens its season at home against a familiar foe in Redlands Arrowhead Christian Academy.\nThe teams meet in the second week of the 2012 season where BC posted a 43-7 road victory.\nThis year, the Eagles are somewhat of a mystery to BC Coach Pat McInally.\n\"We played them last year, but other than that, we don't know much about them,\" he said. \"We've played them throughout the years. They hit very hard and are a well-coached [John Beck] team.\"\nIn last year's meeting, BC quarterback Jack McInally threw for 295 yards and tied a school record with six touchdown passes. Junior receiver Guy Demazeliere had four TD receptions in that game.\nMcInally gets one more crack at the Eagles Friday.\n\"Right now, our skill positions are doing very well and our passing game is looking good,\" Pat McInally said. \"We have an outstanding player on defense in Will Martin.\n}}
{{Tottenham and Arsenal kick off a bumper weekend of Premier League football this afternoon.\nAfter losing back-to-back Premier League games to Burnley and Chelsea, Spurs would love nothing more than to return to winning ways against their fierce North London rivals Arsenal.\nBut the North London derby is equally as important to Arsenal, who can close the gap on Tottenham to just one point with a win.\nBut while Arsenal have form on their side, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will take comfort in the fact that he's never lost at home to the Gunners.\nPochettino can also call upon talismanic striker Harry Kane, who returned from injury last week.\nDele Alli and ill Eric Dier remain absent through illness and injury, while Jan Vertonghen makes the starting XI after picking up a knock.\nArsenal boss Unai Emery leaves Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mesut Ozil on the bench, favouring a forward line Mkhitaryan, Iwobi and Lacazette instead.\nIf you don't want to miss a second of the action, check out Express Online's guide to live streaming below...\n}}
{{A duel between All-County teammates for the No. 1 spot. A plethora of skill players in the middle. And several potential surprises toward the end.\nThe annual OCVarsity Hot 150 again takes an expansive look at the many talented players in Orange County football and ranks them according to their expected impact during the upcoming season.\nThe selections were based on input from coaches and players, analysis of video highlights from last season, college interest, statistics and observations.\nPHOTOS: A fun look at the Hot 150\nMater Dei teammates JT Daniels and Amon-Ra St. Brown were considered for the No. 1 spot, with the junior quarterback edging his senior wide receiver.\nSt. Brown agreed with the selection, noting Daniels\u2019 standing in the class of 2019 as a USC commit. But Monarchs coach Bruce Rollinson suggested another arrangement at the top.\n\u201cBoth of them,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201c1 and 1-A. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to go down that route.\u201d\nFor the OCVarsity Hot 150, there\u2019s only one path toward the 2017 season, so let\u2019s begin:\n1. JT DANIELS\nMater Dei, QB\nMater Dei quarterback JT Daniels. (Photo by Leonard Ortiz, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe Register\u2019s reigning offensive player of the year edged teammate Amon-Ra St. Brown for the No. 1 ranking. Daniels, named Rivals\u2019 No. 1 recruit in the class of 2019, has the advantage as the trigger man for the most potent offense in the county. He set O.C. records last season for passing yards (4,849) and touchdowns (67) and returns nearly his entire offense. Daniels also seems as focused as ever. The reigning Trinity League MVP committed to USC the day before fall camp began and said, \u201cSeason starts tomorrow. Recruiting ends today.\u201d Daniels\u2019 arm fatigue will be watched. He bypassed the Battle at the Beach passing tournament in July to get some extra rest.\n2. AMON-RA ST. BROWN\nMater Dei, WR\nMater Dei wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. (Photo by Sam Gangwer, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe speedy All-County wideout pushed for the top spot on the strength of an impressive summer and junior campaign. He collected 60 receptions last season for 1,229 yards, including a school-record 21 TDs. Scout.com ranks him as the best player in the state for the class of 2018. St. Brown also has a physical concern. He missed the Battle at the Beach passing tournament with a finger injury, but he is aiming to play in the Monarchs\u2019 season opener.\n3. SOLOMON TULIAUPUPU\nMater Dei, LB\nMater Dei inside linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu.(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe highly-recruited transfer from Claremont is a complete player and arrives at Mater Dei at an important time. The senior brings the size (6-2, 220), physical presence, athleticism and leadership to anchor a unit that graduated several players with those qualities after last season. Nicknamed \u201cSolo,\u201d Tuliaupupu had 128 total tackles last season, including 18 for loss. Mater Dei fans will love his aggressive pursuit of ball carriers.\n4. OLAIJAH GRIFFIN\nMission Viejo, CB/WR\nMission Viejo defensive back/wide receiver Olaijah Griffin. (Photo by Sam Gangwer, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe UCLA commit starts the season as arguably the county\u2019s top two-way player. He is the best lockdown-cornerback in the county and also an elite wide receiver. Griffin had 39 receptions for 759 yards and 11 TDs last season. If you don\u2019t believe in his receiving skills, watch him split defensive backs or just run away from others.\n5. AUSTIN OSBORNE\nMission Viejo, WR\nMission Viejo wide receiver Austin Osborne. (Photo by Matt Masin, Orange County Register, SCNG)\nWho needs the spread formation when you have the duo of Osborne and Olaijah Griffin? The Washington commit possesses the route-running skills, 6-foot-3 size and hands to beat double coverage. Osborne averaged a staggering 26.7 yards per reception last season and caught 16 TDs. He is aiming for a third consecutive All-County season.\n6. GRIFFIN O\u2019CONNOR\nEdison, QB\nEdison quarterback Griffin O\u2019Connor.(Photo by Sam Gangwer, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe senior appears well-positioned to deliver another huge season. While veteran Edison coach and passing-game guru Dave White retired after last season, O\u2019Connor teams with new coach Jeff Grady, a former QB under White. The reigning Sunset League MVP also returns plenty of weapons, so he could push toward 4,000 yards passing and 40 TDs. He also rushed for 415 yards last season and 10 TDs.\n7. MATT ROBINSON\nJSerra, QB\nJSerra quarterback Matt Robinson. (Photo by Matt Masin, Orange County Register, SCNG)\nThe Montana commit has the experience, skill set and weapons to produce a monster season. Robinson is a three-year starter in the Trinity League, so don\u2019t expect much to rattle him. The dual-threat passed for just over 2,000 yards last season and rushed for another 459 yards. Robinson\u2019s receiving corps includes speedy Munir McClain, a transfer from Santa Margarita. The Lions also feature transfer running backs Al Fisher and Jamiel Henning. If JSerra finds its chemistry on offense, watch out.\n8. TOMMY BROWN\nMater Dei, LT\nMater Dei offensive lineman Tommy Brown. (Photo by Nick Agro, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe Alabama commit holds down arguably the most important job in O.C. football: protecting the blind-side of quarterback JT Daniels. Brown has the size, toughness and drive to again perform well. And when he does his job, Daniels and his receivers are difficult to handle.\n9. KC CARR III\nTustin, RB\nThe uncommitted senior will be a marked man by defenses this fall, but don\u2019t expect the All-County back to slow down. Ranked No. 114 to start last season, Carr erupted for a county-leading 2,745 yards in the return season for Coach Myron Miller. The ground-oriented Miller remains at Tustin, so expect him and Carr to remain hungry for yardage.\n10. TAE LE\nCorona del Mar, WR/TE\nCorona del Mar receiver Tae Le. (Photo by Kyusung Gong/ Orange County Register, SCNG)\nLe climbed from No. 72 on the Hot 150 last year to be a first-team All-County performer. He teamed with Chase Garbers, who is now at Cal, to grab 78 receptions for 1,294 yards and 22 TDs. The Sea Kings are searching for a new quarterback, but they know what they have in the 6-foot-4, 237-pound Le. Because of his size, versatility and athleticism, he\u2019s a matchup nightmare for defenses.\nPHOTOS: A fun look at the Hot 150\n11. CHRISTIAN LaVALLE\nMission Viejo, LB\nMission Viejo senior linebacker Christian LaValle throws-up the \u201cforks up\u201d of the Arizona State Sun Devils. (Photo by Nick Agro, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe senior gives the Diablos a legit defensive player of the year candidate. The Arizona State commit led Mission Viejo in tackles as a junior with 108.\n12. JULIUS IRVIN\nServite, DB/WR\nServite safety Julius Irvin. (Photo by Sam Gangwer, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe highly-recruited senior anchors an improved secondary, but look for him to also emerge as a deep threat on offense. Irvin, the son of former Rams All-Pro LeRoy Irvin, has USC in his final-five college choices.\n13. MALONE MATAELE\nSanta Margarita, WR/RB/ATH.\nSanta Margarita running back Malone Mataele.The dynamic Utah commit might be the county\u2019s top return man. He had 1,341 all-purpose yards last season and returned two kicks and two punts for scores.\n14. RYAN HILINSKI\nOrange Lutheran, QB\nOrange Lutheran quarterback Ryan Hilinski.\n(TERRY PIERSON,THE PRESS-ENTERPRISE/SCNG)\nHilinski\u2019s future continues to brighten. The junior led the Lancers to the title at the Huntington Beach passing tournament and has plenty of skill players to target, including Servite transfer Kyle Ford. Boston College has offered.\n15. DELON HURT\nServite, WR\nServite\u2019s Delon Hurt.(Photo by Matt Masin, Orange County Register, SCNG)\nThe rising senior dominated at the Battle at the Beach passing tournament and stands as the Friars\u2019 No. 1 target\n16. CJ PARKS\nMater Dei, WR/DB\nMater Dei wide receiver CJ Parks. (Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe UCLA commit is a popular pick for breakout performer to watch. He impressed at the Battle at the Beach 7-on-7 tournament in July and could help the Monarchs on defense.\n17. KYLE FORD\nOrange Lutheran, WR\nKyle Ford, shown playing for Servite in 2016, is now a potential standout for Orange Lutheran. (STEVEN GEORGES, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER)\nFord has emerged as the top junior wideout in the county. As a sophomore, he had 52 receptions for 950 yards, including a huge game against Mater Dei.\n18. ABDUL-MALIK McCLAIN\nJSerra, DE\nJSerra defensive lineman Abdul-Malik McClain. (Photo courtesy of Abdul-Malik McClain via Twitter)\nThe UCLA commit has the speed and size to be a fearsome defender. He should blow past his total of 7.5 sacks in 2016.\n19. ISSAIAH JOHNSON\nLos Alamitos, LB\nIssaiah Johnson, linebacker for Los Alamitos on Friday, July 28, 2017. (Photo by Nick Agro, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe Arizona commit leads a stellar group of linebackers. His resume includes 140 tackles last season and growth in the weight room.\n20. CLYDE MOORE\nCorona del Mar, LB\nCorona del Mar\u2019s Clyde Moore. (Photo by Ed Crisostomo, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nIf you\u2019re looking for a hard hitter, watch the Colorado commit dish out the punishment.\n21. BRU McCOY\nMater Dei, WR/DE\nMater Dei\u2019s Bru McCoy. (Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe junior, with an offer from Ohio State among others, is an emerging star who improved with each game last season. He also is an explosive third-down rush specialist. His six sacks last season earn him bonus points.\n22. ISAAK TOGIA\nPacifica, LB\nPacifica senior linebacker Isaak Togia. (Photo by Nick Agro, Orange County Register/SCNG)\nThe senior\u2019s stock is soaring with recruiters. Offers this summer from Penn State and Notre Dame confirm he plays with a high-octane motor.\n23. NIKKO REMIGIO\nMater Dei, WR\nMater Dei receiver Nikko Rimigio.(Photo by Matt Masin, Orange County Register, SCNG)\nThe Cal commit would be the No. 1 wide receiver for most teams, but he thrives with the Monarchs\u2019 talented bunch. He reeled in 46 receptions for 758 yards last season.\n24. QUINN COMMANS\nWhittier Christian, QB\nWhittier Christian quarterback Quinn Commans. (Photo by Brian Whitehead, Staff)\nThe senior is a must-check player on Friday nights after an eye-popping 2016. In 10 games, he threw for almost 3,800 yards and 43 TDs, including nine against Bell. For the season, he was intercepted only twice in 367 attempts.\n25. BEN JEFFERSON\nPacifica, QB\nPacifica quarterback Ben Jefferson. (Photo by Kyusung Gong/Orange County Register)\nThe speedy senior might be the best pure dual-threat quarterback in the county. If the Mariners make a playoff run, watch his total yards pile up. Jefferson could approach 4,000 yards.\nPHOTOS: A fun look at the Hot 150\nHOT 150: PLAYERS 26-50\n26. JOEY YELLEN\nMission Viejo, QB\nThe St. John Bosco transfer takes the reins of an offense that features wideouts Olaijah Griffin and Austin Osborne, tackle Jarrett Patterson and coordinator Rob Johnson. The junior won a golden ticket.\n27. CHIGOZIE ANUSIEM\nSonora, CB/WR\nCounty fans will be eager to see highlights on both sides of the ball from the Cal commit.\n28. SPENCER LYTLE\nServite, OLB/TE\nThe 6-foot-4, 215-pound junior is a fast-rising defender who has been offered by UCLA among others. He plays with a mean streak.\n29. ZACH RITNER\nCapistrano Valley, DE\nThe senior led a talented defense in sacks last season with 18. He could crack 20 in 2017, so don\u2019t forget his name during postseason awards.\n30. JARRETT PATTERSON\nMission Viejo, OT\nThe Arizona State commit is another tackle who provides vital protection for a high-powered offense.\n31. DAVID ATENCIO\nEdison, WR\nThe athletic senior tops the list of Edison receivers set to prosper with the return of QB Griffin O\u2019Connor. He\u2019ll join the 1,000-yard club this fall, and then he\u2019ll excite the school\u2019s basketball fans during the winter.\n32. CHAD MAGYAR\nSanta Margarita, RB\nThe Eagles found their groove late last season as Magyar rolled up yards in consecutive victories against Orange Lutheran, Servite and Serra of Gardena. They\u2019ll ride the senior, who is also an excellent receiver, again.\n33. AUSTIN WHITSETT\nSan Clemente, RB\nThe highest-ranked Triton surged late in 2016 to help San Clemente capture its historic CIF and state titles. Look for him to pick up where he left off.\n34. CHRIS MURRAY\nMater Dei, OG\nInterior linemen don\u2019t get much attention, but this senior is worth a look. He\u2019s one of the county\u2019s most improved players and holds offers from Stanford and Notre Dame among others.\n35. MUNIR McCLAIN\nJSerra WR\nThe Santa Margarita transfer gives QB Matt Robinson a serious deep threat. The junior could eventually follow his brother to UCLA.\n36. RICKY LANE\nYorba Linda, WR/DB\nThe junior reads the game well. His instincts led to five interceptions in \u201916 while his smooth routes and sure hands netted 64 receptions. He\u2019s a smooth operator.\n36. PESELAO GAUTA\nGarden Grove, OL/DL\nThe Argonauts\u2019 massive lineman (6-6, 330) throws opponents around like dolls. They should try to avoid him.\n38. CHRIS MITCHELL\nMission Viejo, CB\nOffenses would be smart to avoid Olaijah Griffin\u2019s side of the Diablos defense, but they won\u2019t find much relief against Mitchell. He\u2019s outstanding and holds a Notre Dame offer.\n39. TRENT McDUFFIE\nServite, CB\nThe 5-foot-11 junior is rising after setting a school record in the long jump. He landed an offer from USC and impressed during the summer.\n40. BRANDON WON\nSunny Hills, MLB\nWon\u2019s numbers are top-40 worthy: 6-foot-2, 215 pounds, 4.82 weighted GPA, 101 total tackles and four forced fumbles in 2016. The Harvard commit packs a punch.\n41. TYLER CASADOS\nLa Habra, OG\nThe La Mirada transfer returns to his freshman-year roots as a road-grading offensive lineman. La Habra\u2019s line will be stellar.\n42. SEAN RHYAN\nSan Juan Hills, OG/DT\nThe two-way lineman deserves attention. Most of the teams in the Pac-12 have offered, and he\u2019s a big reason why the Stallions could surprise.\n43. CADEN FITCH\nSanta Margarita, LB\nThe senior linebacker surfaced last season as a sure-tackler with excellent pursuit. He led the Eagles with 119 tackles.\n44. MASE FUNA\nMater Dei, OLB\nThe transfer from Santa Margarita is being mentioned as a key player for the Mater Dei defense.\n45. AJ ALLEN\nBuena Park, WR/FS\nThe senior is one of the few well-known players who stayed with the Coyotes after their coaching change. He\u2019s the No. 1 target at receiver and a key defender at free safety.\n46. RYAN CRAGUN\nSt. Margaret\u2019s WR\nThe Penn commit is a highlight-waiting-to-happen as a receiver or kick returner. He had 70 receptions for 1,137 yards as a junior in 2016.\n47. DARION GREEN-WARREN\nMater Dei, DB\nThe newcomer has emerged as one of the county\u2019s top sophomores. He counts Utah as one of his offers.\n48. JACOBAH FUAMATU\nLa Habra, OLB/RB\nFuamatu is another top sophomore. Expect Coach Frank Mazzotta to unleash him on offense and defense.\n49. COOPER JONES\nEl Toro, QB\nThe senior is coming off a strong summer and has talented teammates at receiver, including Austin Derrico. The Chargers love to sling the ball.\n50. JOSIAH NORWOOD\nSanta Margarita, QB\nThe transfer from Troy faces competition for playing time but his dual-threat abilities are intriguing. The Eagles are deep at running back and tight end, so imagine the play fakes.\nPHOTOS: A fun look at the Hot 150\nHOT 150: PLAYERS 51-75\n51. JT MURPHY\nCorona del Mar, RB\nThe senior flashed his potential in the playoffs last season, gaining 240 yards during a windy and cold Division 4 final. With the quarterback spot in question, feeding Murphy carries becomes part of CdM\u2019s answer.\n52. JAKE PARKS\nJSerra, OL\nThe senior anchors a unit that will get after opponents under new coach Pat Harlow, a former offensive lineman at USC.\n53. TITUS TOLER\nServite, DB\nThe junior is among the rising O.C. players offered by UCLA and a big reason why the Friars\u2019 secondary will be tough.\n54. CHASE PETERSEN\nTesoro, QB\nCoach Matt Poston has seen a ton of improvement in the 6-foot-3, 220-pound dual-threat senior. Now it\u2019s the county\u2019s turn.\n55. LUKE WILSON\nYorba Linda, QB\nThe senior has a championship ring, which puts him in a special class for county QBs in 20017. Wilson also possesses excellent touch and accuracy on his deep passes.\n56. PATRICK McMORRIS\nGodinez, ATH.\nThe 6-foot, 165-pound junior is one of the county\u2019s most versatile players and is the reigning Orange Coast League MVP. Malik McMorris\u2019 brother can play running back, receiver, safety and cornerback for the defending Orange Coast champion.\n57. BRENDAN COSTELLO\nSan Clemente, QB\nThe junior, a transfer from Mission Viejo and Santa Margarita, has competition for playing time, but his dual-threat skills and experience make him a serious option.\n58. AUSTIN DERRICO\nEl Toro, WR\nThe 6-foot-3 senior returns as the No. 1 target for Cooper Jones, which is bad news for defenses. The Sea View League offensive MVP had 69 receptions for 1,162 yards and 13 TDs last season.\n59. TYLER JONES\nAliso Niguel, WR\nThe 6-foot-2 senior racked up 70 catches for 1,074 yards and 14 TDs last season, and is also a dangerous return man.\n60. ZACH FOGEL\nLa Habra, QB\nThe dual-threat senior, who recently committed to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, was clutch last season in the playoffs, helping the Highlanders reach the CIF-SS Division 2 semifinals. He\u2019s athletic and carries a 4.91 GPA.\n61. SAMUELA TUIHALAMAKA\nMater Dei, DT\nThe senior transfer from M.L. King of Riverside is a preseason All-County pick who should clog running lanes. Keep an eye on him.\n62. JOHN HUMPHREYS\nCorona del Mar, WR\nHumphreys showed major potential late last season as a freshman and hasn\u2019t slowed. He\u2019s a two-way starter and might be the team\u2019s best \u201cpure football player\u201d, according to Coach Dan O\u2019Shea.\n63. JAMARI FERRELL\nMission Viejo, RB\nThe Diablos have a ton of weapons on offense, but if they want to help new QB Joey Yellen settle in, just turn the Ferrell loose. The junior showed his potential last season when he got a season-high 20 carries against San Clemente. He gained a season-high 145 yards.\n64. KEANU NORMAN\nLos Alamitos, RB\nNorman\u2019s star should continue to rise after a promising sophomore year, but he needs to clear a meniscus injury first. He\u2019s also an outstanding kick returner.\n65. NATHAN MANNING\nCapistrano Valley, QB\nThe junior goes from being an All-CIF wide receiver to replacing the graduated Kevin Brown. The dual-threat is on the fast track physically and mentally.\n66. CHRIS KANE\nSan Clemente, TE\nKane will help grow the Tritons\u2019 tradition of blue-chip tight ends. Look for the senior to soar past his 2016 total of 28 receptions.\n67. JOHN McCARTAN\nSanta Margarita, TE\nThe Fresno State commit delivers serious damage as a blocker and forms an impressive duo with Jake Peters.\n68. JAKE PETERS\nSanta Margarita, TE\nThe senior is back from knee surgery and already hauled in an offer from Arizona.\n69. KEKANIOKOA GONZALEZ\nMater Dei, C\nThe senior carries on the county\u2019s legacy of elite centers. Scout.com ranks Gonzalez as the best in Orange County.\n70. ALEX MISKELA\nLos Alamitos, LB\nThe St. John Bosco transfer is another reason why the Griffins look so intimidating. The 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior has been offered by BYU.\n71. JACK GENOVA\nMater Dei, LB\nThe linebacker has come back strong from a knee injury in \u201916, prompting Coach Bruce Rollinson to call him the surprise of preseason camp.\n72. JACK MUENCH\nMission Viejo, DE\nThe senior should again be a disruptive force coming off the edge. Air Force and Army are among his offers.\n73. RIAN FIELDS\nIrvine, DE/OLB/WR\nThe senior is a sleeper off a squad that went 2-7-1 in \u201916. He\u2019s 6-foot-5 and has the athletic ability to make plays on offense, defense and special teams. Howard has offered.\n74. COLSTON CHACON\nCorona del Mar, OT\nThe 6-foot-4, 275-pound tackle protected Chase Garbers\u2019 blindside last season. The Sea Kings are counting on him again. Columbia among others has offered.\n75. ALEX POURDANESH\nCorona del Mar, ATH.\nThe transfer from University brings big-play capabilities and versatility to the Sea Kings.\nHOT 150: PLAYERS 76-100\n76. DOMINIQUE THOMPSON\nCypress, WR\nThe athletic senior was slowed a bit last season by injuries, but he still showed potential. He continued to impress during the summer. \u201cWe threw against Edison in summer and he was great,\u201d Centurions coach Rick Feldman said.\n77. PAUL PIFERI\nVilla Park, QB\nThe first-year starting junior has big shoes to fill as the replacement for Nick Sipe, who is now at Purdue. The 6-foot-4, 195-pounds Piferi has a few Ivy League offers.\n78. TJ McMAHON\nServite, QB\nThe senior has competition for playing time, but he impressed at the Battle at the Beach tournament in July, helping the Friars reach the quarterfinals.\n79. JOSH TARANGO\nCanyon, DL/RB/TE\nThe senior (6-2, 270) developed into a defensive force last season and was athletic enough to get a few carries on offense. He is Canyon\u2019s version of Malik McMorris (Mater Dei/Cal).\n80. ANDREW FAOLIU\nMater Dei, DE\nThe senior will be more than ready for his move from offense to defense. He practices daily against Tommy Brown.\n81. NATHAN LOGOLEO\nMater Dei, DE\nThe senior is the Monarchs\u2019 defensive sparkplug and leading returning tackler from \u201916.\n82. CAMERON GARDNER\nOrange Lutheran, WR\nThe Mater Dei transfer brings major speed to the Lancers, and could emerge as the No. 2 option after Kyle Ford.\n83. JEREMIAH FLANAGAN\nHuntington Beach, WR/CB/ATH.\nThe 6-foot-4, 185-pound junior impressed during the summer with his size, speed and athleticism. UNLV and San Diego State have already noticed. He is the type of playmaker the Oilers need. Teammate Arick McLawyer is a similar athlete.\n84. AL FISHER\nJSerra, RB\nThe senior transfer from Paramount returns to his freshman stomping ground as a breakaway threat. He\u2019s the brother of former JSerra star RB Edward Vander.\n85. JAMIEL HENNING\nJSerra, RB\nThe Lions have not one but two standout transfer running backs. Henning, from Buena Park, might be more elusive than Fisher but both are playmakers.\n86. SHAKOBE HARPER\nMater Dei, RB\nThe Monarchs are a pass-first offense with JT Daniels, but the ultra-quick junior (5-7, 180) will chew up the yards with his opportunities.\n87. SKYLER TAYLOR\nLa Habra, RB\nThe senior transfer from Troy is coming off a 768-yard season and now will run behind one of the best lines in the county. Watch out.\n88. SHANE BOWE\nTesoro, OT\nThe well-rounded senior excels at pass protection and pulling on run plays.\n89. LUKE LaCILENTO\nServite, OG\nThe senior guard/center anchors the Friars\u2019 offensive line at 6-foot-3, 315 pounds. San Diego has offered.\n90. LUKE HOGGARD\nEdison, LB\nThe junior returns as the Chargers\u2019 second-leading tackler from \u201916. He collected 119 tackles for the CIF champs.\n91. JACK BOLDUC\nJSerra, OL/DL\nThe 6-foot-5, 235-pound senior has been offered by Montana and Montana Statte\n92. LATU KOLOPEAUA\nOrange Lutheran, OT\nIf the Lancers get good line play, they might be the third-best team in the Trinity and the county. Kolopeaua (6-2, 245) is their top returning offensive lineman.\n93. SHAWN NIELSEN\nJSerra, DL\nThe junior (6-2, 245) emerged in \u201916 as one of the Lions\u2019 rising sophomores. He collected five sacks last season.\n94. DYLAN NICHOLSON\nFullerton, RB/WR\nThe speedy senior posted 1,077 all-purpose yards as a junior, so expect even more production this season. Howard has offered.\n95. ALEX ASHCRAFT\nCypress, QB\nThe 5-foot-9 senior makes up what he lacks in height with smarts and mobility. Last season, he passed for 2,165 yards, including 300-yard games against Tustin and Valencia.\n96. JASON WILKINSON\nOrange, QB\nThe 6-foot-4, 195-pound senior didn\u2019t play quarterback last season but generated a buzz with a strong summer. He also has speedy Syrus Collins and Jordan Schmidt at receiver.\n97. TRAVIS LAU\nSan Juan Hills, WR\nThe Linfield Christian transfer nabbed 32 receptions last season but could make a bigger impact at safety. Eastern Washington has offered.\n98. JACK CARMICHAEL\nEdison, RB\nThe bruising 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior gives the Chargers the ground attack to balance Griffin O\u2019Connor. He rushed for 188 yards and three TDs in the CIF finals last season en route to a 1,000-yard season.\n99. KEITH JONES\nSan Clemente, WR\nThe senior gives the Tritons some of that Brandon Reaves spark. He grabbed 55 receptions in \u201916.\n100. MATT MOSLENKO\nPacifica, WR\nThe senior is the top target for QB Ben Jefferson after collecting 45 receptions for 758 yards and 11 TDs last season.\nHOT 150: PLAYERS 101-125\n101. Thomas Wade, San Clemente, DT/OT\nThe improving 6-foot-6, 265-pound senior has been offered by Montana State.\n102. Matt Faupusa Los Alamitos, OL/DL\nThe 6-foot-3, 305-pound senior is a sleeper recruit from the Jesse Sapulo training group. The Griffins see him as the key to their success in the Sunset.\n103. Anthony Shipton, Villa Park, DT\nThe 6-foot-4, 285-pound senior is a force in the middle. He racked up 87 tackles last season.\n104. Malik Banks, Villa Park, LT\nThe powerful drive-blocking tackle has been offered by San Diego and UC Davis among others.\n105. Parker Thomas, Edison, DL\nThe senior could become one of the next pass-rusher standouts at Edison. He recorded 6.5 sacks last season and now teams with newcomer Hunter Griggs.\n106. Nathan Perez, Valencia, DE/RB\nThe senior was an explosive player on defense last season, but new coach Jason Gray will give him a heavier role on offense in \u201917.\n107. Jonoven Smith, Fullerton, S/WR\nThe senior proved to be a ball-hawk last season by collecting five interceptions and breaking up six passes. He and Dylan Nicholson are a strong under-the-radar duo.\n108. Tarik Luckett, JSerra, WR\nThe 6-foot-2 Luckett is another junior receiver to watch with the Lions.\n109. Nick Friedman, Trabuco Hills, OLB\nThe all-South Coast selection plays with a high-speed motor and could push toward 100 tackles.\n110. Talik Sekona, Orange Lutheran, LB\nThe middle linebacker was the Lancers\u2019 second-leading tackler, behind Brandon McKinney, last season. Look for him to be first in tackles this fall.\n111. Sai Mikaio, Tustin, OG/NG\nWhen you see all those yards from KC Carr, remember this 6-foot, 290-pound senior. He gets after opponents.\n112. Jaydyn Webb, Yorba Linda, RB\nThe motivated senior returned from a knee injury to rush for just over 1,300 yards and 20 TDs in \u201916. He dedicated his season to injured teammate Luke Dawson.\n113. Jojo Forest, Orange Lutheran, CB\nThe rising junior flashed his cover skills and tackling ability as a sophomore in the Trinity League.\n114. Isaiah Alcocer, La Habra, CB\nThe senior might be an O.C. sleeper, but the Highlanders know how good he was last season: four INTs, 13 pass breakups.\n115. Akili Arnold, Mission Viejo, DB\nThe junior gained valuable experience last season, and that will help the Diablos\u2019 secondary in \u201917.\n116. Dominic Wingfield, Servite, WR\nThe senior showed last season against De La Salle that he\u2019s a name to remember: 11 catches for 122 yards.\n117. Jojo Hawkins, Orange Lutheran, Jr.\nThe ultra-quick transfer from Buena Park didn\u2019t post big numbers last season but the junior will excel with QB Ryan Hilinski and the Lancers\u2019 cast of athletes.\n118. Michael Martinez, Mater Dei, TE\nThe 6-foot-6, 235-pound junior showed he\u2019s an athletic target with a spectacular, one-handed grab on the decisive 2-point conversion in the final of the Battle at the Beach tournament against St. John Bosco. Oregon has offered.\n119. TJ Medina, JSerra, LB\nThe senior returns as the Lions\u2019 top tackler from 2016. Also keep an eye on Hot 150-considered Calvin Mouisset at linebacker.\n120. Hunter Ancich, Villa Park, ATH.\nThe son of Spartans coach Dusan Ancich is uniquely versatile. He excels at wide receiver, defensive back and punter.\n121. Blaine Riederich, Marina, LB/RB\nThe senior helped lead the Vikings\u2019 resurgence in \u201916 by contributing on offense and defense.\n122. Logan Loya, Orange Lutheran, WR\nLoya\u2019s versatility makes him ultra valuable to the Lancers. He plays wide receiver and kicks. San Jose State has offered the sophomore.\n123. Michael Nadeau, La Quinta, QB\nAt 6-foot-5, 220 pounds, the junior is generating buzz with his powerful runs and soft touch on passes.\n124. Brandon Coleman, Garden Grove, FS/WR\nThe senior (6-1, 170) is a big hitter and playmaker on defense. He\u2019ll also pound opponents on offense.\n125. Alex Jung, Sunny Hills, RB\nThe senior piled up highlights against just about every foe last season en route to almost 1,500 yards.\nHOT 150: PLAYERS 126-150\n126. Reece Hite, Mission Viejo, DE\nThe 6-foot-5, 235-pound junior might be an O.C. recruiting sleeper, but the Diablos know he comes off the edge fast.\n127. Cross Faletoi, Rancho Alamitos, QB\nThe left-handed junior is an emerging dual-threat quarterback who also hauled in 52 receptions last season. Also remember the name of a new player for the Vaqueros: LJ Kennedy, a speedy transfer who briefly played last season for Edison of Stockton.\n128. Noah Melbon, Westminster, QB\nThe Lions expect big things from the dual-threat senior, who has four solid receivers and a trio of running backs in his arsenal.\n129. Cade McGee, Whittier Christian, WR\nQB Quinn Commans has a deep receiving corp around him, but the 6-foot-1 senior stands out based on \u201916 production: 63 receptions for 1,166 yards, 20 TDs.\n130. McCade Barrett, Edison, WR\nLook for the athletic senior to emerge as the Chargers\u2019 No. 2 wide receiver, behind rising David Atencio.\n131. Alonzo Pineda, Kennedy, RB\nLook for the hard-running senior to crack the 1,000-yard barrier for the second consecutive season.\n132. Jordan Schmidt, Orange, CB/WR/ATH.\nThe senior with 4.5 speed is a playmaker on offense, defense and special teams. He nabbed seven interceptions last season and returned six kicks (four punts) for TDs.\n133. Malcom Wesley, Santa Ana Valley, RB\nThe athletic senior flashed his potential at receiver the past two season, but now he becomes the Falcons\u2019 featured back. \u201cHe\u2019s a beast,\u201d Valley coach Larry Mohr said.\n134. Donald McKinney, Tustin, WR\nRemember former Tustin wideout George Wilson? McKinney (6-4, 185) is the brother of the former All-County player who is now at Utah. \u201cHe\u2019s special,\u201d Tillers coach Myron Miller said of McKinney.\n135. Hunter Griggs, Edison, DE/DB\nThe transfer from Pinnacle of Ariz., is a player to remember when the Sunset League rolls around. He\u2019s 6-foot-2, 215 pounds and can run.\n136. Nathan Arrington, Katella, QB\nThe 5-foot-10, 235-pound senior won\u2019t have James Faitasia as a target this season, but the Orange League offensive POY is armed with experience. He passed for almost 1,500 yards last season.\n137. Augustine Jo, Kennedy, DE/OG\nUndersized at 5-foot-9, 180 pounds, Jo posted nine sacks last season and now adds offensive guard to his duties. \u201cHe\u2019s so tough,\u201d Kennedy coach Sean Clark said.\n138. Richard Yukihiro, Los Alamitos, NG/OL\nAnother under-sized defender, the 5-foot-11, 250-pound Yukihiro is a handful for opposing centers.\n139. Caine Savage, Western, WR/DB\nRemember the names of this rising sophomore and his twin brother, Cassius. Caine swept the 200 and 400 meters at the Empire League track finals in May, and the Pioneers return junior quarterback Anthony Munoz. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty special kids,\u201d Western coach Dan Davidson said. Senior John Ojelabi is another receiver to watch.\n140. Damian Macias, Santa Ana, QB/DB\nThe reigning Golden West League MVP helped the Saints reach the CIF finals last season with his versatility and leadership.\n141. EJ Gowdy, Buena Park, LB/RB\nThe junior emerged last season with 89 tackles \u2013 fourth on the team \u2014 but the Coyotes have bigger plans for him in 2017.\n142. Doug Jackson, San Juan Hills, QB\nAaron Flowers knows how to coach-up quarterbacks, so expect the 6-foot-3, 175-pound senior to have a strong senior season.\n143. Gavin Klepper, Fullerton, QB\nThe 6-foot-3, 220-pound junior has improved his accuracy and could elevate the Indians in the Freeway League.\n144. Grant Caraway, Los Alamitos, QB\n\u201cFlying way under the radar,\u201d Los Alamitos coach Ray Fenton said of the senior (5-11, 175). \u201cHe\u2019s extremely athletic. The improvement that he\u2019s made on his throws is really impressive.\u201d\n145. Thomas Keeling, University, QB\nThe junior\u2019s apprenticeship began with solid numbers for a sophomore: 1,181 yards, 10 TDs and four INTs. The question is whether the Trojans can protect him.\n146. Allen Pacheco, Santa Ana, RB\nThe Saints love to run the football, and the senior could fill the void left by the graduated Jorge Briseno.\n147. Michael Callahan, Yorba Linda, DE/TE\nCoach Jeff Bailey is high on the rising junior defensive lineman, who attended the Nike The Opening Regional in the spring.\n148. Dylan Brady, Santa Margarita, K\nA senior with range to make a 60-yard field goal has to make the list, right?\n149. Keyon Ware-Hudson, Mater Dei, DL\nThere\u2019s a chance the highly-recruited junior returns from a knee injury to play late in the season. He recorded 10 sacks as a sophomore for Vista Murrieta in \u201916. USC, UCLA and Michigan are among his many offers.\n150. Ethan Rae, Orange Lutheran, TE\nThe Lancers were excited to utilize the 6-foot-5, 240-pound junior \u2013 a transfer from Servite \u2013 but he suffered a knee injury in early August. His availability for the season is unknown but he\u2019s a major talent.\nThe next 6 (listed alphabetically): Noah Aguilar, El Toro, WR; Michael Dyer, Capistrano Valley, WR; A.J.

For me, it is absolutely the best job in English football.\n\"I will do everything I can to help England do well and give our nation the success our fans deserve. Above all, we have to make the people and the whole country proud.\"\nFootball Association chief executive Martin Glenn said: \"His excellent managerial credentials, including his ability to realise the potential of players and teams, develop a strong team ethos and embrace modern methods that enhance performance, made him the outstanding choice.\n\"We could not help but be energised by his personal perspective on England's future.\"\nA statement on the FA's website said Allardyce's primary target is qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but he \"is also charged with helping technical director Dan Ashworth integrate and strengthen the FA's elite performance and coaching programme across the England senior and development teams at St George's Park\".\nAllardyce's first competitive match will be in Slovakia on 4 September as England begin their qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup.\nHe leaves Sunderland after nine months, and the Black Cats are now looking for their ninth manager in eight years.\nA statement from the club read: \"The focus of everyone at Sunderland AFC is on moving forward quickly and decisively, with the appointment of the club's new manager to be confirmed at the earliest opportunity.\"\nAllardyce, a former Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham boss, becomes the 14th permanent England manager.\nHe has never won a major trophy but did win promotion to the Premier League with Bolton and West Ham.\nA popular choice\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Sam Allardyce right person for England - Jose Mourinho\nAllardyce has been endorsed by his fellow managers, including Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho, former England manager Sven Goran-Eriksson and ex-Spurs boss Harry Redknapp.\nMourinho said Allardyce was \"more than ready\" to lead the national side, while Redknapp said he would bring \"a Premier League style and pace\" to the national side.\nFormer FA director David Davies told BBC Radio 5 live: \"This is a challenge for English football. This is the person the League Managers' Association probably would have wanted. Now will the clubs actually go out of their way to help the national team because they've got the person they wanted - one of their own?\"\nThe process\nAllardyce was first interviewed for the England job following Eriksson's departure after the 2006 World Cup, but Steve McClaren was appointed. He has been vocal about his disappointment in not being selected then.\nThis time he was the early favourite, chosen by a three-man FA panel of Glenn, Ashworth and vice-chairman David Gill ahead of Steve Bruce, who resigned as Hull City manager on Friday.\nBournemouth's Eddie Howe and USA manager Jurgen Klinsmann were reported as potential candidates, but it is not known how many other interviews were conducted.\nWhy has he got the job?\nThe FA panel said it wanted a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who could build a clear team identity.\nGlenn told BBC sports editor Dan Roan the new manager would need to \"build resilience\" in players so they are able to deal with criticism on social media and the pressures of an \"intensely passionate\" English media.\nNeil McDonald, who has worked alongside Allardyce at three Premier League clubs, said: \"He gives the players everything they need to perform to the highest level and lets them express themselves as much as they possibly can.\n\"He's been in the game a long time, he's won a lot of games and a lot of respect off everybody and it's well deserved to be given the England job.\n\"He should have had one of the big four, big six jobs in the past.

They\u2019ll do battle with Juventus, Inter and Milan over Fiorentina\u2019s Federico Chiesa, who has a \u00a370m release clause.\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action Read more\nTottenham also fancy making a move for Newcastle defender Fabian Sch\u00e4r, though they\u2019ll face competition from Arsenal and, presumably, Newcastle, while the club are also making plans for Hugo Lloris\u2019s long-term replacement. Lazio goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha is their No 1 choice for No 1.\nElsewhere in north London, the news is a little less exciting. Arsenal appear to have missed out on H\u00e9ctor Herrera, with the Porto midfielder closing in on a move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, though an \u00a38m move for Ajax left-back Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico could be on the cards.

{{FSU football is prepared for the likely departure of running back Dalvin Cook following the bowl game, but here are the reasons he should stay for 2017.\nSaturday\u2019s win over the rival Florida Gators was more than just another big win for the Florida State Seminoles \u2013 it was another showcase for the best player on the FSU football squad, running back Dalvin Cook.\nNearly outgaining the entire Gators\u2019 offense by himself in total yardage, Cook dropped 153 yards and another touchdown on the ground as he continued his dominance against Florida, any team that plays in the Sunshine State and\u2026well, quite frankly, against anyone he plays.\nArticle continues below ...\nIt was also a bittersweet game for fans of the \u2018Noles considering it was probably the final time he will take the field at Doak Campbell Stadium. Many experts believe Cook will turn pro following FSU\u2019s bowl game this season (possibly an Orange Bowl game played in Cook\u2019s hometown of Miami).\nBut, is there an argument to be made the Cook should stay for his senior season? Here are the top three reasons he should return to Tallahassee in 2017?\nNo. 1 \u2013 Cook could run away with every record there is\nThis season, Dalvin Cook has added to his magical run in Tallahassee by becoming the school\u2019s all-time leading rusher for a career as well as breaking the record for most rushing touchdowns in a career. After Saturday\u2019s showing against the Gators, Cook needs just 72 yards in the bowl game to break the single season record \u2013 one he set last season.\nIf Cook got to his 2016 average of 135 yards per game in the bowl, he would get to 1,755 for the season and 4,454 for his career. Those numbers could intrigue to stay to become just the 28th player in FBS history to reach 2,000 yards in a season and the sixth ever to get 6,000 for a career \u2013 meaning he could be not just one of the best backs in FSU football history, but in all of college football history.\nNo. 2 \u2013 Cook could get the National Title / Heisman combo\nIn 2016, plenty of experts thought that Cook would be one of the finalists heading to New York City for the Heisman Trophy while the Seminoles would be prepping for a CFB Playoff appearance. While the first part remains to be seen, the \u2018Noles didn\u2019t exactly live up to expectations when it came to playing for a title.\nThat could change in 2017. On offense, Deondre Francois will have a valuable year under his belt while bringing back many of the receivers he grooved with (even if Travis Rudolph goes pro). The offensive line has to be better, while the defense is going to be stacked \u2013 even with DeMarcus Walker gone \u2013 with guys like Josh Sweat, Derrick Nnadi (if he stays), Brian Burns, Matthew Thomas, Tarvarus McFadden and\u2026oh yeah, Derwin James coming back.\nFSU football will be the favorite in almost every game next season \u2013 except maybe the opener against Alabama to open the season. Even if they lose that game, the \u2018Noles will be the team to beat in the ACC (with Clemson losing their talent and Louisville coming to play at FSU) and, again, in the state of Florida.\nAs far as the Heisman goes, Cook would be one of the opening favorites even if he isn\u2019t a finalist this season. In 2017, his real competition will be Louisville\u2019s Lamar Jackson, Washington\u2019s Jake Browning and Alabama\u2019s Jalen Hurts \u2013 and Florida State plays both Jackson and Hurts next year, which would give Cook a chance to outshine both.\nNo. 3 \u2013 Cook could position himself to be the 2018 NFL Draft\u2019s top pick\nAlong the lines of why he would be a Heisman favorite, Cook would be entering a 2017 draft class that has a decent amount of talent \u2013 but also names from schools that will get playoff exposure and non-stop talk from all the \u201cexperts\u201d.\nTrue, Cook would be a first round pick without a doubt if he were to leave right now. But imagine what he would be if he stayed for another season? Many of the 2018 mock drafts have Penn State\u2019s Saquan Barkley going in the mid first round as the first back taken. With another season like 2015 or 2016, Cook could be a top five pick \u2013 maybe even the second FSU football star to be taken first overall if things go according to plans.\nLook, I know the chances are slim that Dalvin Cook suits up for the Seminoles in 2017. However, it is not out of the realm of possibilities \u2013 and could completely shake up the college football world if he does.\nThis article originally appeared on\n}}

{{Are Michigan fans worried about playing Ohio State on the road?\nFor those of you saying that Ohio State should have been rooting for Michigan on Saturday, shut up. Michigan was proven to be a fraud in their game against Iowa. All they have done all year is beat up on inferior opponents \u2013 of course they are going to look dominant\u2026 And honestly, their defense is dominant. But as a team \u2013 they\u2019re pretenders.\nThe Wolverine running game is mediocre, and their QB is pretty average too. In fact \u2013 starting QB Wilton Speight suffered an injury in Michigan\u2019s loss to Iowa and is out for the year. Now the Wolverines are stuck with the back-up to an average quarterback.\nArticle continues below ...\nMichigan has been playing cupcakes all year: Hawaii (4-7), UCF (6-4), Rutgers (2-8), Illinois (3-7), and Michigan State (3-7). Sure \u2013 Ohio State played Rutgers and will play MSU, but at least the Buckeyes play tough opponents on the road.\nMichigan\u2019s toughest opponents this year were Colorado, Wisconsin and Penn State. All were played in Ann Arbor. They finally played a sort-of decent team on the road on Saturday, and lost. If I remember correctly, they play a more than sort-of decent team on November 26 on the road\u2026\nI\u2019m not denying the fact that Michigan has made tremendous strides under Jim Harbaugh \u2013 just here to remind people the media jumped the gun on them. They aren\u2019t quite there yet. With John O\u2019 Korn under center for the Wolverines we aren\u2019t quite sure what to expect, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll look much different.\nMichigan has good receivers for him to throw to. Honestly I think John O\u2019 Korn is just as good as Wilton Speight \u2013 so we won\u2019t see too much of a decline on offense from the Wolverines.\nAs a Buckeye fan, you\u2019ve got to be feeling pretty good right now. Ohio State looks like it\u2019s peaking right now \u2013 Michigan looks like they\u2019re hitting a wall. Only scoring 13 against Iowa has got to scare the Wolverines fanatics.\nThe Hawkeyes lost to an FCS school, but beat Michigan\u2026 The Hawkeyes gave up 35 points to Purdue, but only 13 to the Wolverines\u2026\nIt\u2019s time to panic in Ann Arbor, but time to smile in Columbus.\nThis article originally appeared on\n}}
{{UCLA lined up against the top team in the Pac-12 South and had a chance to make what should have been a first-half blowout into an improbable one-score game.\nNose-to-nose with Utah, the Bruins flinched. Literally.\nAfter a false start on Chigozie Nnoruka in the closing seconds of the first half, J.J. Molson was forced to attempt what would have been a career-long 52-yard field goal instead of a safer 47-yard attempt. The kick was short, but only by a few yards. It would have kept the Bruins in a seven-point game at halftime.\nOf UCLA\u2019s five penalties in its 41-10 loss to Utah on Friday, four came on special teams. The Bruins (2-6, 2-3 Pac-12) committed two more penalties on special teams the prior game against Arizona.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just having some poise,\u201d head coach Chip Kelly said. \u201cGood teams don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nThe Bruins, against the first-place team in the division, had a chance to show they were indeed growing into a good team, but instead walked away with their worst home loss in eight years. The Utes (6-2, 4-2 Pac-12) dominated with their trademark physical style of play, mixed in a tricky wide-receiver pass that went for a touchdown and finished the Bruins off with the help of UCLA\u2019s own self-inflicted wounds, mistakes like penalties, drops and missed tackles that just won\u2019t seem to leave the program, despite a change in coaching staff.\n\u201cUtah\u2019s been a very well-respected, very talented team for the past, 10, 12, 15, 20 years,\u201d quarterback Wilton Speight said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the same type of players it seems year in and year out: big guys, hustle guys, that are able to make a lot of plays.\u201d\nKyle Whittingham was hired as an assistant coach at Utah in 1994, the same year Speight was born. Since taking the head coaching job in 2005, Whittingham has coached the Utes to 11 bowl games. They\u2019ve grown into one of the toughest outs in the Pac-12 with stout defense and impeccable special teams, and now with an offense that\u2019s scored 40 points in four consecutive wins, the Utes have the look of a team ready to rise to their first Pac-12 South title.\nMeanwhile, the Bruins, still in their first year under Kelly, appear to be stuck on the ground floor.\nDisappearing linebackers\nKrys Barnes met Zack Moss at the goal line. The Utah running back won big.\nNot only did Moss fall forward for a 1-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter, but Barnes was injured on the play and didn\u2019t return. Although he didn\u2019t have any noticeable brace or bandage while watching from the sideline with his helmet on, the junior middle linebacker appeared to not move his right arm much while walking or jogging.

The Bruins had only three scholarship inside linebackers practicing at the position Tuesday. Junior Tyree Thompson was the only one of the group made it through Friday\u2019s game unscathed.\nAlong with Barnes, redshirt sophomore Leni Toailoa was also shaken up momentarily during the second half. His older brother Lokeni Toailoa, who had moved to outside linebacker in recent weeks to accommodate for other injuries and suspensions, had to move back to inside linebacker so UCLA could simply have two middle linebackers on the field at a time before Leni returned.\nUCLA\u2019s depth at inside linebacker was already a major question in training camp. The Bruins then lost senior Josh Woods and junior college transfer Je\u2019Vari Anderson in training camp. They\u2019ve have given up 614 rushing yards in the past two games, with Arizona and Utah averaging 6.98 yards per carry.\n\u201cSee how we started in the beginning of the fall, people have been dropping. So you have to step up,\u201d said Thompson, who had a team-high 11 tackles. \u201cEverybody prepares the same every week, from Day 1. So it\u2019s the next man up.\u201d\nQuick hits\nDefensive back Colin Samuel appeared to suffer a right knee injury on the opening kickoff of the second half. He did not return to the game after needing help from two trainers to get off the field.\n}}
{{AP\nJermichael Finley doesn\u2019t have to watch \u201cLeague of Denial\u201d to have second thoughts about his profession, and what it means to his family.\nThe Packers tight end was stopped in his tracks when he got home from a game against the Bengals earlier this year, in which he suffered a concussion.\nHis 5-year-old son Kaydon had written him a note which said: \u201cI\u2019m glad you got off the field. Because that hit looked nasty.\u201d\nThe next night, as he was putting Kaydon to bed, the message became even clearer.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Daddy, I want you to stop playing football,\u2019\u201d Finley told Jason Wilde of ESPNWisconsin.com. \u201cIt was one of those things where you\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s crazy that a 5-year-old would say that.\u2019 The violence, the intensity of the game \u2026\n\u201cI get calls from my grandma all the time. I tell her I only want to play 8 to 10 more years, and she says, \u2018Boy, you need to quit this dang game.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I know the risks. But family members that care about you, they see it from a different perspective than we do.\u201d\nThat\u2019s part of the reason Finley doesn\u2019t let his son play football, and wonders if he\u2019ll ever feel comfortable.\n\u201cAll the side things that come with being a professional athlete, not just a football player, but a professional athlete, period \u2013 you\u2019ve got people worshipping you, the money, the fame \u2013 are great. And, I really do love the game,\u201d Finley said. \u201cBut with him, . . . I don\u2019t know about football. And, he doesn\u2019t know about football \u2013 and that\u2019s the good part.\n\u201cRight now we\u2019ve got him in soccer, tennis, and he plays flag football at the YMCA. And that might be as far as he\u2019ll go. The thing is, where is it going to go next in the next 10 years, when he is playing at a higher level and he\u2019s going to really strike people? I don\u2019t think my son will play. He\u2019s really intelligent; he knows when I\u2019m hurt. He doesn\u2019t forget anything.\u201d\nThe 26-year-old Finley will have more decisions to make in the future. He\u2019s going to be an unrestricted free agent after the season, after banking $8.25 million this year to play a game he wonders about. That\u2019s the trade-off for many players, who have to balance the financial security for their families with their own, making decisions the 5-year-olds can\u2019t for themselves.\n}}
{{A new study on Black student athletes is getting lots of attention with March Madness in full swing.\nIt compares the graduation rates of Black men\u2019s college football and basketball players to non-athlete Black male students at the same schools.\nThe study says that the student athletes have a lower graduation rate than the non-athletes do, and it\u2019s particularly troubling because the additional financial and academic support the athletes receive seems not to make much difference, ESPN.com reports.\nAn analysis of the 2014-2015 academic year at the 65 Power 5 conference schools found that 58 percent of Black male undergraduates earned a degree within six years. The same schools graduated 54 percent of Black athletes.\nThe University of Pennsylvania conducted the study. Researcher Shaun Harper, director of the University\u2019s Center for Race and Equity in Education, said the study reveals a systemic problem:\n\u201cIt happens just about everywhere. Generations of young Black men and their parents and families are repeatedly duped by a system that lies to them about what their life chances are and what their athletic outcomes are likely to be.\u201d\nEarlier this week, a University of Central Florida study reported an increase in the graduation rate for Black men\u2019s basketball players at the 68 NCAA Tournament schools: 75 percent this year, compared to 69 percent in 2015.\nThat\u2019s good news, but White men graduated at a 93 percent rate from those same schools.\nRichard Lapchick, director of UCF\u2019s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, told the Associated Press that poor K-12 education in many urban areas is an underlying cause for the disparity.

{{SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u0097 Two University of Utah football players were shot and wounded at a party, their coach said Sunday.\nSophomore Lo Falemaka and freshman Marcel Brooks-Brown were expected to recover, Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham said in a statement.\n\u201cObviously, our first concern is that both Lo and Marcel are going to be OK, which appears to be the case,\u201d Whittingham said.\nAccording to Salt Lake City police, 20-year-old Falemaka and 18-year-old Brooks-Brown were shot in the torso and were hospitalized in stable condition.\nWhittingham said it\u201ds unclear when either player would be back on the field but he is optimistic it will be in the near future.\nPolice spokeswoman Robin Heiden says the two victims got into an altercation late Saturday night with three men who refused to leave a private party.\nHeiden says one of the suspects allegedly pulled out a gun and shot them both. The three suspects then fled the scene.\nThey are described as being in their 20s. One is black, 6 feet tall and was wearing a baseball cap with a red bandanna underneath and a red T-shirt. The second suspect was black, 5-foot-9 with short dreadlocks. He was also wearing a baseball cap and a red T-shirt. Third suspect was white, heavy set and had facial hair, police said.\nFalemaka, who grew up in West Valley City, Utah, started as a walk-on in 2013. He is on scholarship. The tight end has appeared in two games this season on special teams.\nBrooks-Brown, of Rio Linda, California, is in his first season and was expecting to redshirt.\n}}

{{Leave it to Josh Norman to speak his mind.\nAsked how he thinks the NFL product could be improved, the never-shy, oft-fined Washington Redskins cornerback quickly offered one suggestion: It's time for some turnover at league headquarters.\n''Simple: Get the people who are in there out. Whoever's making the rules, just get `em out. We have a new president; have a new NFL commissioner,'' Norman said, sitting in front of his locker at the Redskins' practice facility this week.\nThen the guy docked more than $75,000 this season for various reasons \u2013 an illegal hit, a bow-and-arrow pantomiming celebration and, most recently, postgame criticism of an official \u2013 added wryly: ''I hope I don't get fined for that.''\nWith the NFL's TV ratings down this season, it's become a popular parlor game to come up with explanations for the decline. Also popular: the notion that the quality of the product has decreased. If that's true, how can the game get better?\n''It's still a great game. But there's no question there's probably a lot of things that could help the game,'' said Dan Reeves, who coached four Super Bowl teams after his career as a running back ended.\nFor one thing, Reeves surmised, rules in the 2011 labor contract that eliminated training camp two-a-days and reduced in-season practicing in pads to protect players might have had the opposite effect.\n''It's very difficult to learn how to block and tackle now, so technique-wise, things are not as good as they could be. From a coach's standpoint, it's very difficult to get good at things if you don't practice,'' he said. ''And I personally wonder if injuries are up, because you don't learn how to protect yourself playing at full speed. The only time you really do it now is in a game.''\nReeves also offered a theory about the ratings, saying: ''You're getting a little overexposure. It's sort of like when you're eating \u2013 after a while, you get enough.''\nAmong the various improvements suggested by current and former players during conversations with The Associated Press:\n-Expand rosters, both to account for replacing injured players and perhaps to lessen the likelihood of injury by giving some players more snaps off.\n''I would find a way to get three more players on both sides of the ball. Maybe one each for offensive line, running back and quarterback, then add another defensive lineman, another a linebacker and another defensive back,'' Pro Football Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott said.\n-Make all stadiums have grass fields, to try to lessen injuries.\n-Let defensive players go back to being more physical.\n''I understand the league is trying to keep people safe, but I think it's so hands-on that you can't play as fast as you want to, sometimes. It kind of messes you up, because if you do go all out \u2026 you might end up giving most of your money back from that week in fines for a hit or a certain tackle,'' New York Jets safety Rontez Miles said.\n-Try to rebalance a field tilted in favor of offense.\n''If you really, really, really want to see how good receivers are today, eliminate the 5-yard rule, and go back to letting defensive backs play football,'' said Joe Theismann, who won a Super Bowl as quarterback of the Redskins. ''Maybe the wide receivers would have to work again and it would be fair, because right now, it's not.''\n-Have more significant consequences for game officials who err .\n''A referee could make a bad call and cost a team a game,'' Redskins defensive lineman Chris Baker said, ''and all that's going to happen is they're going send an apology letter and say, `I'm sorry.' But nothing actually happens.''\n-Rewrite the rulebook to make it more easily understood. Start with the definition of a catch.\n-Stop throwing flags or doling out fines when a good play is followed by rejoicing.\n''Maybe stop policing the celebrations so harshly. I think that's one place to start,'' Packers QB Aaron Rodgers said.\nWashington's Norman certainly would agree. Otherwise, though, he thinks the on-field state of the NFL is in good shape \u2013 just not necessarily in good hands.\n''The game has been this way for 100 years. Why are people in the (league) office trying to change it? What are you trying to make better? Why touch the game? \u2026 Change the staff. We changed the president; let's change them, too,'' he said. ''There should be a number of years you can run it. There should be a term limit in the NFL.''\n\u2014\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell and Teresa M.

{{The fee to buy University of Michigan football season tickets will be expanded to Michigan Stadium's entire bowl and increased by up to $100 per seat for the 2013-14 season, the school's athletic department said today.\nThe \"preferred seat donation\" fee is an annual charge, begun in 2005 for most of the stadium's seating bowl except for some end zone areas, for the right to buy a season ticket. The money is used to support the athletic department.\nThe Victors ($600), Valiant ($475) and Maize ($350) levels each have been increased by $100. The Blue ($200) level has gone up by $75, and the end zone seats ($75) increased by $25.\nThe base season ticket price of $65 per game remains unchanged from last season, UM said.\nSome season ticket holders in the end zones have already been paying a PSD, while others were not. The new policy now covers all seats in the bowl.\nAny current end zone season ticket holders who have had a ticket prior to 2005 and already pay the PSD will have their PSDs phased in over the next two seasons, at $37.50 per seat in 2013 and $75 per seat in 2014, the department said.\nSeason ticket holders will be able to make the PSD payments in their online account for the first time beginning with the 2013-14 season, the school said.\nAlso new is the ability for a season ticket holder to transfer a ticket to another person for a one-time $500 fee.\nMichigan also charges preferred seat donation fees for men's basketball and ice hockey season tickets.\nLastly, Michigan said it will continue its policy of not selling any display advertising inside the stadium during games.\nMichigan Stadium seats 109,901.\n}}
{{Article continues below ...\nRegardless of what transpires on Dec. 3, the Sooners will need help to get in the Playoff. One of the dominoes fell on Thursday when Houston manhandled Louisville and eliminated the Cardinals from Playoff contention. Assuming that Alabama and Clemson continue to win and capture their respective conference titles, those two teams will be part of the final group selected.\nMichigan and Ohio State, the other two teams currently in the top four, meet this Saturday. And this is where it gets interesting.\nIf Michigan beats Ohio State, the Wolverines will go on to play Wisconsin in the Big 10 championship. If the Wolverines beat the Badgers, they win the Big 10 title and secure a spot in the playoff. In this scenario, the committee will then have to choose between a two loss Big 12 champion (Oklahoma, if they finish strong) and the Pac-12 champion for determining the final spot in the Playoff field.\nIf the Washington Huskies beat Washington State on Friday, they will face Colorado for the Pac-12 title. If the Huskies prevail, the committee\u2019s choice will be simple, since a one loss Pac-12 champ will trump a two loss Big 12 champion, regardless of the differences in strength of schedule.\nBut, if Colorado beats Washington in the Pac-12 championship, the Sooners\u2019 chances for the last Playoff spot are greatly enhanced, since the committee will be unlikely to elevate Colorado into the Playoff.\nLikewise, if Washington State beats Washington in the Apple Cup game on Friday, the Sooners\u2019 chances for a playoff spot will be boosted as well, because the committee is unlikely to elevate the winner of the resulting Pac-12 championship in this scenario.\nThe Playoff Case Against the Sooners\nIf Ohio State beats Michigan, the Penn State Nittany Lions, assuming they beat a bad Michigan State team, will play for the Big Ten title. And if Penn State beats Wisconsin, the Nittany Lions will likely punch their ticket to the Playoff, even with two losses.\nCombine the Big 10 scenario that has Penn State winning the conference with a Washington win against Washington State and then a victory over Colorado or Utah for the Pac-12 title, and that means Washington gets into the Playoff as a one loss Pac-12 champion. The Big 12 gets left out in the cold for the second time in three seasons.\nMeanwhile, if Washington stumbles in either of its remaining games and Penn State wins the Big 10, would the committee take another look at a two-loss Ohio State and select the Buckeyes over a two-loss Big 12 conference champion Oklahoma? That scenario is very possible, given the fact that the Buckeyes beat the Sooners in Norman. But if the committee sticks to the principle that conference champions trump teams that didn\u2019t win their conference, then that would bode well for the Sooners.\nThere are more permutations that can be discussed as the college football season winds down. Regardless of what happens with other teams vying for a spot in the 2016 College Football Playoff, the Sooners must beat Oklahoma State on Dec. 3 and win the Big 12 title to remain in the mix. And given how the season started, it\u2019s an incredible accomplishment for Oklahoma to be in the playoff discussion, no matter what happens in the weeks ahead.\nThis article originally appeared on\n}}
{{New Orleans Saints tight end Jimmy Graham yesterday filed an appeal for the arbitration ruling earlier this month that declared him as a tight end rather than a wide receiver when his team designated him their franchise player.\nThe appeal was merely procedural, as the two sides are expected to reach a long-term deal, perhaps today, that reportedly will make him the highest-paid tight end in the history of the game\u2014though still not in the lofty territory of the wealthiest of wide receivers.\nThroughout this process, the statistics website Pro Football Focus has emphasized the fact that 66.8 percent of his snaps last season saw him either lined up in the slot or out wide in the formation, or \u201caligned as what we would abstractly label a wide receiver if somebody drew it up on a chalkboard\u201d.\nThe site objected to the arbitration ruling, but not for the verdict\u2014rather, for the explanation, which they say is the equivalent of \u201cif it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\u201d.\nAfter all, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to visually discern a tight end from a wide reciever, what with many taller wide receivers rising to the top of the league. Two 6\u20195\u201d wide receivers were taken in the first round of the most recent draft.\nTight ends, meanwhile, are taking on a larger and larger role in the passing game as a pass catcher, and their assignments, and body types, are changing.\nPFF\u2019s data, in fact, indicates that Graham\u2019s usage in typical wide receiver roles last season was not even the most frequent among tight ends. That honor went to Denver Broncos tight end Jacob Tamme, who lined up as an in-line tight end only around 20 percent of the time last season. Three other tight ends also saw more time in \u2018wide receiver\u2019 roles last year than did Graham.\nThey argue, however, that there is still a large gap between a wide receiver and a tight end because of the way that wide receivers are used. According to their charting, the receiver who lined up in-line most frequently last season was Alshon Jeffrey, who only did it approximately five percent of the time.\nThey write:\nThere is a 14% gap of no-man\u2019s land between the two positions [in terms of setting up in-line in the formation] and this is the key. If you wanted to prove a player was actually being deployed as a wide receiver and not a tight end you would need to show that he was at least beginning to cross this divide. In Graham\u2019s case not only is he not crossing it, but he isn\u2019t even the closest to doing so\u2026What we can say is that Graham is in a group of players who have branched off from the main pack of tight ends and could have a reasonable case to be termed \u2018receiving tight ends\u2019. None of the players in that group is a notable blocker and most are rarely even asked to do it. These are players who are receivers in primary purpose but simply proportioned (and aligned) differently to the average wide out.\nThey argue, as I\u2019ve argued, that this is a matter of the tight end evolving, rather than tight ends becoming wide receivers. It\u2019s true that the lines are becoming increasingly blurred, and the body types less distinguishable, but there still remains a divide.\n}}

{{\u2022 Former Tottenham and Liverpool player reveals torment of youth \u2022 \u2018It frightened me to death, I did not know what to do\u2019\nThe former Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool player Paul Stewart has revealed he turned to drink and drugs during his career after suffering sexual abuse by a youth coach.\nStewart, who played three times for England, claimed he was assaulted on a daily basis for four years by a coach who had told him he would \u201cmake him a star\u201d.\nSecond footballer reveals abuse by serial paedophile Barry Bennell Read more\n\u201cOne day, travelling in the car, he started to touch me. It frightened me to death, I did not know what to do, I tried to tell my parents not to let him in but I was only 11,\u201d Stewart told the Daily Mirror.\n\u201cFrom then, it progressed to sexually abusing me, he said he would kill my mother, my father, my two brothers if I breathed a word about it. And at 11 years old, you believe that.\n\u201cHe would say: \u2018Does anyone want to drive the car?\u2019 I sat with a leg on one side by the steering wheel. That is when he first touched me.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe mental scars led me into other problems with drink and drugs. I know now it was a grooming process. The level of abuse got worse and worse.\u201d\nHis revelations come after the former Crewe Alexandra player Andy Woodward waived his anonymity to tell the Guardian about the abuse he suffered under the youth coach Barry Bennell. Steve Walters, one of Woodward\u2019s former team-mates, has also spoken out about his abuse at the hands of Bennell, who served nine years after admitting 23 specimen charges of sexual offences, including buggery, against six boys aged nine to 15. Woodward has criticised Crewe for their lack of apology in the first official statement the club have released about the escalating Bennell case.\nStewart, who is now a businessman based in Blackpool, said he had decided to go public nearly 40 years after the abuse in the hope more victims will come forward.\nAndy Woodward criticises Crewe over lack of apology in Barry Bennell case Read more\n\u201cYou would not believe how many times I contemplated suicide, even when things were going well,\u201d he said. \u201cI was playing for Spurs and England, at the peak of my success. But there was that constant feeling. It was so dark and I just wanted to step out of it. Drinking was a release.\n\u201cOver the years I have thought: \u2018Why did I not tell anybody?\u2019 But it is because of the stigma that was attached to it. A child could be ostracised and it is hard for family to believe it. Sometimes they would believe the adult.\n\u201cI am sure there are players \u2026 who have struggled through life. I want them to feel they are not alone and not to be ashamed of it, and hopefully something can be done if these people are still alive.\u201d\n\u2022 In the UK, The Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

{{Harry Cobden is lucky. At the age of 20 he will ride Clan Des Obeaux, the joint-second favourite, in his first Gold Cup on Friday. He will also enter the Cheltenham Festival as the 10-time champion trainer Paul Nicholls\u2019s stable jockey in one of the most coveted positions in racing. Clan Des Obeaux is part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson and Cobden tells some amusing stories about hanging out with Fergie even though, as he cheerfully admits, he knows nothing about football. Just days before the biggest week of his life, Cobden also knows he is far luckier for a different reason.\nThrills of Cheltenham Festival week can\u2019t mask racing's uncertain future Read more\nOn 1 June last year, while racing at Market Rasen, Cobden fell off Mick Thonic and broke his neck. It was a severe break and, if it had occurred a few millimetres to either side, he could have been paralysed. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says with a relieved smile on a grey day at Newbury racetrack. \u201cIt was a bit worrying because, as one consultant said, \u2018You might not be able to ever ride again.\u2019 It was a proper fracture straight through my C2 vertebra after I got unseated at the last and whiplashed off the ground. It was a tingle to start with but when your adrenaline calms down, everything starts to go rigid. It was a lot more serious than I thought.\u201d\nCobden sounds like a typical jockey \u2013 brushing off a broken neck as if it is comparable to a pesky cold. Yet how long did he endure the bleak prognosis that he might never ride again? \u201cA week, maybe. It worried me a little but I was fairly positive. I was more interested in getting out of hospital. And I was very fortunate to be all right. I had four months out and it wasn\u2019t that bad. I had a great summer and I didn\u2019t really follow the racing. It was the best way to deal with it. If I thought about falling off, I wouldn\u2019t be in the right job.\u201d\nCheltenham is more dangerous than most tracks and at last year\u2019s Festival seven horses died. \u201cThere are more runners and it\u2019s very competitive,\u201d Cobden concedes. \u201cYou go very fast and that\u2019s why there are more fallers. Last year didn\u2019t look good to the public. But jockeys get upset when there are fatalities. We don\u2019t treat them like machines. We love them and they\u2019re really well looked after.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously terrible to lose a horse you\u2019re racing. It\u2019s happened to me once \u2013 three years ago at Cheltenham. It was on the day I won the Greatwood Hurdle on Old Guard. Looking back, I was clueless. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I thought I did, but I was hanging on for dear life. Pointed it in the right direction, followed everyone else and won. Two races later, in the last of the day, the conditional jockeys\u2019 race, my horse broke its leg galloping. It was horrible. But the vets are very quick and dealt with it brilliantly.\u201d\nCobden brightens again when we turn to Clan Des Obeaux and the Gold Cup. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good horse and we know each other well. I\u2019m hoping there won\u2019t be any dramas and he will come back safe and sound.\u201d\nDoes he believe Clan Des Obeuax, who is favoured by some to beat Presenting Percy, can win? \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got a massive chance. I wouldn\u2019t get off my horse to ride any other at the moment. I quite like Native River [who won the race last year]. He\u2019s a little under par this year but, if the ground goes soft, he\u2019s also got a massive chance.\nI don\u2019t sit at home and think I\u2019m going to win the Gold Cup. It might be different the night before \u2013 but I haven\u2019t got flustered over it so far, even if it\u2019s the best race of the year. The National can throw up an odd winner that wouldn\u2019t even get to the start of the Gold Cup. This one counts most.\u201d\nHarry Cobden and Clan Des Obeaux (right) clear the last to win the Betfair Denman Steeple Chase from Terrefort and Nico de Boinville at Ascot last month. Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images\nA serial champion owns a share in the horse, too. \u201cHe\u2019s a lovely man,\u201d Cobden says. \u201cI\u2019ve met him three or four times. He\u2019s inspirational and the sort of person you could listen to all day. I went to Old Trafford because of him last month.\u201d\nIs Cobden a Manchester United fan? \u201cNo. I\u2019m not a big football fan. I know nothing about football but it was a great experience as it was the first game I\u2019ve ever been to. It was Man U v PSG and we went to Sir Alex\u2019s box afterwards and chatted about the football. I didn\u2019t really understand it. He said things which totally went over my head. I still loved listening to him and the PSG supporters were crazy. It was pretty fantastic.\u201d\nCobden does not think much about football as his work for Nicholls is so demanding. The Ditcheat trainer\u2019s yard is in fine form and Cobden has some excellent horses this week. Yet ever since the brilliant Ruby Walsh relinquished his position to concentrate on racing in Ireland, other jockeys have struggled as Nicholls\u2019s retained jockey.\nEven more than the good fortune in riding for Nicholls, there is sustained expectation. \u201cObviously there\u2019s pressure riding for Paul and you have to perform,\u201d Cobden agrees. \u201cBut as long as I\u2019ve done the best I can, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nDoes he think about getting fired? \u201cYou never know what\u2019s round the corner and no one\u2019s ever got a safe job. It could happen one day, couldn\u2019t it? It will happen one day. But hopefully not in the near future.\u201d\nIt must be more complicated riding alongside Bryony Frost, another gifted young jockey, at Nicholls\u2019s yard? \u201cAs in?\u201d Cobden asks, looking briefly defensive.\nThe pair used to be a couple and Frost has received far more attention than Cobden \u2013 even though he is Nicholls\u2019s retained jockey. \u201cYeah, I was seeing her a bit. She\u2019s great for racing, because she\u2019s always passionate, isn\u2019t she? The cameras like it, the press like it. There were certain things in the paper but the press likes to make a story out of it. I still get on really well with Bryony. We\u2019re going up to Kelso together tomorrow. To make Ditcheat the best team, everyone\u2019s got to get on.\u201d\nPat Kelly, quiet man of horse racing, could make big noise in Gold Cup Read more\nWhile Cobden\u2019s ultimate ambition is to become champion jockey, he is close to fulfilling his immediate target of riding 100 winners this season. \u201cI broke my neck after 30 days and missed four months so it looked unrealistic. But I\u2019m up to [96] winners so it\u2019s looking pretty good.\u201d\nCobden grins when asked about the prospect of winning a few more this week, including the Gold Cup. \u201cThat would be a fairytale, wouldn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll definitely feel very lucky if it happens.\u201d\n\u2022 Harry Cobden is fourth in the Stobart Jump Jockeys\u2019 Championship. Go to greatbritishracing.com\n}}

{{VALENCIA >> West Ranch took a three-point lead into the fourth quarter, but two Oxnard touchdowns ended the Wildcat\u2019s historic season Friday night.\nScoring 20 second-half points, Oxnard defeated West Ranch 34-31 to advance to the CIF-SS Division 6 semifinals. A week after winning the first playoff game in the program\u2019s history, West Ranch couldn\u2019t overcome a second consecutive nailbiter.\n\u201cWe battled\u2026we had our chances, and we just came up a little bit short,\u201d said West Ranch coach Chris Varner.\nWest Ranch quarterback Weston Eget threw two third-quarter touchdown passes to put the Wildcats up 24-21, one each to brothers Ryan and Jovan Camacho.\n\u201cThose guys have been everything the past three years,\u201d said Varner, \u201cThe two best players in West Ranch history.\u201d\nWest Ranch touchdown!

Do you believe in miracles? pic.twitter.com/cZEvBWKNK0 \u2014 The Paw Print (@wrpawprint) November 10, 2018\nThe Wildcats failed to convert on fourth down on two consecutive drives in the second quarter, the first resulting in an interception on fourth and goal. Oxnard bailed them out the first time, losing a fumble on the West Ranch 33-yard line.\nBut after the Wildcats turned the ball over on another fourth down, the Yellow Jackets (10-2) responded with a 72-yard touchdown run from junior Xavier Harris on the first play of the drive.\n\u201cWe thought we could steal some momentum,\u201d said Varnar, \u201cWe thought with the Camachos and Weston, we had a chance.\u201d\nThe Yellow Jackets benefited from two non-offensive touchdowns, one on a blocked punt recovered in the end zone early in the third quarter, and another on an 80-yard interception return from junior safety RJ Aranda.\n\u201cThey got athletes, they got some (Division 1) guys. They were well prepared, and took advantage of a couple of mistakes.\u201d\nFor the Wildcats (9-3), it was a bittersweet end to a historic season. After starting 8-0, the Wildcats dropped their last two games to Hart and Valencia, pushing them in a three-way tie for second place in the Foothill League. A coin flip left the Wildcats out of a guaranteed playoff birth, but an at-large bid gave them a spot against Silverado, a game they won 35-31, marking the program\u2019s biggest-ever victory.\nWest Ranch recovers from a blocked punt nicely, as Jovan Camacho breaks away to put the game back within one score, 17-21. pic.twitter.com/SY7qYwzzN1 \u2014 The Paw Print (@wrpawprint) November 10, 2018\nThey couldn\u2019t repeat the magic this week, however.\n\u201cThe last five games have been back-and-forth battles,\u201d said Varner, \u201cMy kids never quit, and I was really proud of what they were able to do.\u201d\nDespite the loss, Varner thinks the experience will benefit the team next year: \u201cNow they\u2019ve been there, so we just hope as a program we just continue to keep the momentum going.\u201d\n}}
{{Lynn Swann, USC\u2019s first-year athletic director, looked to calm a groundswell of frustration at the start of the football season.\nFive days after the Trojans dropped their season opener to top-ranked Alabama, 52-6, the third worst defeat in school history, Swann urged fans to stay patient.\n\u201cOne game, especially the first game, does not make a season and does not break a season,\u201d he said in an interview published on the school\u2019s website.\nWhen Swann spoke with reporters four months later on Monday night after USC\u2019s 52-49 victory over Penn State in the Rose Bowl, a dramatic comeback to cap an improbable in-season turnaround, he remained measured.\nAsked if the Rose Bowl win, the first since the Pete Carroll era, was enough to return the Trojans to the pinnacle of college football, he said it was not.\n\u201cIf we were back at the top of the national landscape, we\u2019d be playing on Monday, January 9th,\u201d Swann said, referring to the College Football Playoff national championship game between Alabama and Clemson. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. It\u2019s a building process.\u201d\nBut Swann, who replaced Pat Haden last summer, noted that USC\u2019s return to the Rose Bowl signaled progress.\nUSC went 1-3 in September, its worst start since 2001, before closing with nine consecutive wins to finish 10-3 overall.\n\u201cIt says something about the team, and it says something about the coach,\u201d Swann said.\nCoach Clay Helton replaced Steve Sarkisian as the interim coach midway through 2015, before he was hired on a permanent basis. The decision was made by Haden, predating Swann\u2019s arrival.\nFor most of the fall, Swann offered few public comments on Helton or the football program, before speaking for several minutes outside the visiting locker room Monday, when he commended Helton for his role in leading the Trojans\u2019 turnaround.\n\u201cWe have a coach who can convey a message to his kids and who believe in it,\u201d Swann said. \u201cHere\u2019s a man who believes in what he\u2019s doing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He\u2019s not just talking to talk for an inspirational speech on gameday, but he believes in these kids and the kind of program he wants to put together. He has my support, and I think we\u2019ll continue to grow.\u201d\nHelton said of both Swann and Haden, \u201cThe knowledge that both men have given me, the support that both men have given me, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better. I\u2019m just in a unique and special situation and thankful to both men.\u201d\nTargeting review\nSophomore linebacker Cameron Smith was flagged and ejected for targeting in the third quarter of USC\u2019s Rose Bowl win over Penn State.\nSmith, the Trojans\u2019 top tackler, was penalized for a helmet-to-helmet on Trace McSorley, the Nittany Lions\u2019 quarterback.\nUnder NCAA rules put forth starting with the 2013 season, if a player is penalized for targeting in the second half of a game, he is ejected and also forced to miss the first half of his team\u2019s next contest.\nHelton said Tuesday he did not know if the penalty would carry over to next season and if Smith would be suspended for the first half of the 2017 season opener against Western Michigan.\nA spokesperson for the Pac-12 could not be immediately reached for clarification.\nQuick hits\nJunior cornerback Adoree\u2019 Jackson has an ankle injury and there was no structural damage to his knee, Helton said. Jackson left the Rose Bowl in the third quarter after he was hurt on a kickoff return. \u2026 Helton did not say if there was a timeline for when Jackson and junior receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster would announce their decisions regarding the NFL draft.

{{It\u2019s good news for your fantasy football teams that the Premier League has become awash with attacking talent and hungry goalscorers.\nMore so than ever before, attacking talent is the flavour of the month, with this proved true after Man City ended the last campaign by smashing the record number of goals scored in a top flight season.\nThe main source of points in your fantasy football team will be goals, which makes it so important to pick goalscorers from all over the pitch.\nJust as Mo Salah was listed as a midfielder in last year\u2019s game, before he went onto score 44 goals, there are a few players who really should be listed as strikers who have slipped the net. (F.Y.I, Salah is now a striker).\nSign up to play Dream Team 2018/19 now Dream Team is back and better than ever ahead of the new Premier League season\nahead of the new Premier League season Completely free to play\nto play \u00a3400k jackpot up for grabs across the season\nup for grabs across the season SIGN UP FOR DREAM TEAM 2018/19 HERE\nWe\u2019ve done the digging for you and identified five goalscoring midfielders who should be listed as strikers in this year\u2019s game\u2026\nFantasy football tips: Goal scoring midfielders who should be strikers\n1 Sadio Mane \u2013 \u00a36m\n7 The Senegalese talisman is already one of the most picked players in fantasy football\nMane is a player who is fortunate to not be listed as a striker in this year\u2019s fantasy football, especially after his goalscoring antics last season.\nThe Liverpool man racked up a hefty 244 points in fantasy football last year and was one of Liverpool most prolific players behind Mohamed Salah.\nThe 26-year-old bagged 20 goals for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side last season, including one in the Champions League final, and also chipped in with ten assists.\nAlthough his teammate Salah saw his position changed from a midfielder to a striker in this year\u2019s game, Mane somehow slipped the net.\nThe Senegalese man is the only one of Liverpool\u2019s deadly attacking trident who is not listed as a front-man, with Roberto Firmino also a striker in this year\u2019s game.\nMane is listed as \u00a36m in this year\u2019s game, which makes him by no means a cheap option, however he is almost certain to repay your investment with goals from midfield and plenty of them.\nKlopp\u2019s man has already been snapped up by 24% of Dream Team managers.\n2 Marko Arnautovic \u2013 \u00a34m\nGetty Images - Getty 7 The powerful forward was a changed man last season\nArnautovic was a bright spark in what was an otherwise disappointing campaign for West Ham last season.\nThe Austrian started to be deployed in a centre-forward role towards the end of the season, where he scored the necessary goals to steer West Ham from safety.\nThe 29-year-old bagged 11 goals and eight assists in fantasy football last season, helping him to finish on 132 points.\nArnautovic\u2019s performances in a forward role last season would have impressed new manager Manuel Pellegrini, who has played the enigmatic character in a similar role throughout pre-season.\nThe Austrian will remain as a midfielder in this year\u2019s game, which makes him an even more enticing prospect for your fantasy football team.\nArnautovic is a relative bargain at just \u00a34m and has already been selected by 11% of Dream Team managers so far. So why haven\u2019t you picked him yet?\n3 Wilfried Zaha \u2013 \u00a34.5m\nGetty Images - Getty 7 Zaha looks as though he is staying at Selhurst Park\nCrystal Palace fans will be thanking their lucky stars that Zaha has decided to stay at the club.\nThe 25-year-old had been at the centre of transfer rumours throughout the summer, but with the end of the window edging ever closer, his future seems to be with Palace.\nThe talisman winger was a crucial player in Roy Hodgson\u2019s side last season, scoring nine goals and assisting five, helping him to rack up a hefty 124 points in fantasy football.\nZaha has carried his impressive form into pre-season, having impressed for the Eagles in a more advanced role.\nAvailable for \u00a34.5m in this season\u2019s fantasy football game, the Ivorian might seem like a pricey option considering he plays for Palace, but he is the type of player who can win games on his own.\nThe 25-year-old has been selected by 7% of managers so far and could prove to be the difference in your fantasy football team too.\n4 Raheem Sterling \u2013 \u00a36m\nGetty - Contributor 7 The winger surprised a lot of people last season\nSterling was one of the most improved players in the Premier League last season and enjoyed the best campaign to date with Man City.\nThe 23-year-old racked up a mammoth 265 points in last year\u2019s fantasy football game, with most of those points coming through his goalscoring antics.\nSterling scored 23 goals last season, as well as chipping in with 17 assists, and seemed to grow in confidence every week under Pep Guardiola at the Etihad.\nAs he is priced up at \u00a36m, Sterling is far from a cheap option for Dream Team managers this season.\nYou get what you pay for however and the lightning quick winger will get you goals from midfield in a City team sprinkled with superstars.\nSterling has only been selected by 6% of managers so far, giving you an opportunity to get ahead of the crowd by picking the City man.\n5 Leroy Sane \u2013 \u00a35m\nAlamy Live News 7 The German winger will look to bounce back after his World Cup snub\nSane played like a man possessed last season and fully cemented his position in Guardiola\u2019s starting eleven.\nThe 22-year-old performed years above his age, scoring 14 goals and assisting 19 during the season, helping him to pick up a mouthwatering 207 points in fantasy football.\nThe winger was even rewarded with the PFA Young Player of the Year award after his impressive campaign.\nThe 22-year-old was a surprise omission from Germany\u2019s World Cup squad and will be motivated to prove his doubters wrong this season.\nThe German is priced up at \u00a35m in this season\u2019s game and is already proving to be a very popular pick.\nSane has been snapped up by a whopping 32% of Dream Team managers already this season, making it fairly important that you pick him to keep pace with your rivals.\nHow does Premier League fantasy football work?\nEvery single season the Premier League gets more intriguing \u2013 and playing Dream Team really is the perfect way to enhance your experience of it.\nYou\u2019ll be assigned a total budget of \u00a350m for each side you pick and you\u2019ll be able pick a maximum of 10 free teams.\nThe Game Weeks run from Friday to Thursday, effectively meaning the new Game Week starts after the last Europa League games are completed.\nGetty 7 Emery and Arsenal will tackle the Europa League this season\nYou get three transfers a month on the first Friday of every month so using them wisely is essential.\nEvery player on the game will be assigned a price at the start of the season which will then vary and fluctuate on a weekly basis dependent on their performances.\nFor example, last season we valued Mo Salah at \u00a34m at the start of the season but the Egyptian King rocketed to over \u00a311m by the end after his stunning goalscoring form.\nMake sure to check out our website or app to see how our simplistic points system works.\nFantasy football tips: Why you should AVOID Mo Salah this season\n7 Sorry Mo\nMo Salah broke all kinds of records last season, not least becoming only the second player in Dream Team history after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach he 400 point barrier.\nBut could this campaign be a different story?\nSo far he\u2019s the most selected player on Dream Team \u2013 but we\u2019ve got evidence to suggest why you should avoid him at all costs.\nIn previous seasons, the top Dream Team points scorers have pretty much all succumbed to a curse the year after and you can read about it here.\n}}

{{SAN JOSE \u2014 All season long, Carlmont High has had a straightforward formula for success. Play tough defense and stick to the running game on offense.\nThat strategy paid off big-time Friday night as the Scots upset No. 1-seeded Independence 28-21 in the semifinals of the Central Coast Section Division IV playoffs. Fifth-seeded Carlmont now advances to the championship game against No. 2-seed Burlingame next weekend. Time and day have yet to be announced.\nIndependence was 11-0 coming into Friday night\u2019s contest. Not surprisingly, the 76ers were a solid favorite to play Burlingame for the championship. Burlingame earned its way into the title game with a 49-12 rout of Overfelt.\nCarlmont, which is 10-2 and has won 10 in a row, scored less than two minutes into the game on a 56-yard reverse by Jayden Kuhn. The Scots scored again midway through the second quarter on a 3-yard run by Julian Morin. That and the two-point conversion made it 14-0.\nThe Scots never looked back.\nIndependence (11-1) made a run in the fourth quarter, cutting Carlmont\u2019s 21-7 halftime advantage to seven on a 35-yard pass from Jordan Ausbie to Dylan Oliver with 5:12 to go.\nBut Carlmont\u2019s Jonaven Kuhn dashed 36 yards with 2:26 left to make it 28-14, and though Independence scored to make it 28-21 with 1:16 left on an Ausbie to Jesse Lopez hook-up from 14 yards out, it was too little too late. Independence tried an onside kick after the late touchdown, but Carlmont recovered and ran out the clock.\n\u201cWhen someone tells you you can\u2019t so something, it\u2019s especially gratifying when you get it done,\u201d Carlmont coach Jake Messina said. \u201cIndependence has tremendous athletes, but we pride ourselves on being physically tough.\u201d\nMessina, who is in his third year as head coach at Carlmont after spending 11 years at Merced as defensive coordinator, showed his emotional side after the game, choking up while delivering a fiery talk to his players.\n\u201cHe\u2019s only emotional when we do good and make him proud,\u201d Jonaven Kuhn said. \u201cHe can be pretty harsh, too. But he is a really good coach.\u201d\nKuhn and Morin are really good running backs, and Carlmont relies on them to make offense run. Coming into the game against Independence, they had 2,402 yards and 19 touchdowns between them. That\u2019s 218 yards per game.\nAgainst Independence, they ran for 289 yards. Morin had 191 yards and two touchdowns. Kuhn added 98 yards and Carlmont\u2019s game-clinching TD in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cThroughout the week, everyone was executing their assignments and making precise decisons,\u201d Morin said. \u201cI had a good feeling coming in.\u201d\nCarlmont finished with 373 yards on 46 rushes. The Scots had 288 of those yards in the first half. They did not attempt a pass during the first two quarters, and finished the night 1-of-2 for 12 yards\n\u201cOur sophomore quarterback is athletic and talented,\u201d Messina said of Siupeli Netane. \u201cWe\u2019ll throw when we have to.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t Friday night with the run game churning out almost 400 yards.\nRelated Articles Why students are banned from Los Gatos vs. Palo Alto sports contests\nFootball: Menlo-Atherton\u2019s Adhir Ravipati steps down\nPrep column: In Clayton Valley saga, BVAL paints grim football picture\nNCS moves Clayton Valley football to East Bay Athletic League\nAs NCS football playoff changes loom, we offer suggestions Independence wasn\u2019t bad on offense with 107 rushing yards and 170 throwing.

{{An extensive independent review of the University of Maryland\u2019s football program determined it \u201cfostered a culture where problems festered because too many players feared speaking out\u201d \u2014 but stopped short of calling the program \u201ctoxic.\u201d\nThe Baltimore Sun obtained a copy of the roughly 200-page report, which the University System of Maryland\u2019s governing body has not released. The Board of Regents continued to probe the report\u2019s findings \u2014 and discuss the futures of high-level university employees \u2014 during a private conference call Thursday afternoon. They are to meet again Friday in closed session.\nThe football program has been under increased scrutiny since the death of 19-year-old Jordan McNair, who suffered heatstroke during a May 29 practice in College Park. This investigation into the state flagship\u2019s football program, which is being overseen by the regents, was catalyzed by explosive media reports that described coaches as bullying, demeaning and intimidating certain players.\n\u201cWe do not find that the culture caused the tragic death of Jordan McNair,\u201d the report states.\nThe eight-person commission tasked with examining the football team culture \u2014 which includes former Gov. Robert Ehrlich, retired U.S. District Court judges Ben Legg and Alex Williams, and former prosecutor Charlie Scheeler \u2014 interviewed more than 150 people, including 55 student-athletes who played football under head coach DJ Durkin. The third-year coach has been on administrative leave since Aug. 11.\nThe report did not contain personnel recommendations, though it certainly divided up blame among school officials. The regents were expected to discuss during their call whether to retain Durkin, university President Wallace Loh and athletic director Damon Evans. Amid the uncertainty over top university officials\u2019 futures, power players are already forming camps on either side of the debate.\nState Sen. Jim Rosapepe, a Democrat representing College Park, issued a preemptive public statement in support of Loh.\n\u201cThe people that are trying to get rid of Dr. Loh do not have an academic agenda,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey have a cronyism and sports agenda.\u201d\nThe report delves into instances of athletics department mismanagement, many unrelated to McNair\u2019s death, over the past two years. The commission found that the athletics department \u201clacked a culture of accountability\u201d and was plagued by frequent turnover, dissension and infighting.\nA former coach compared the athletics department\u2019s dysfunction to Washington politics. Durkin, a first-time head coach, apparently received little guidance when he took over the Terps, who are part of the high-pressure Big 10 Conference.\nMuch of the report dives into vivid allegations of the strength and conditioning coach\u2019s physically and mentally abusing players, including calling them names and shaming them. Many of these stories come from athletes who once shared a field with McNair.\nRick Court, who was at the center of many media allegations, \u201cwas effectively accountable to no one,\u201d the report found. Court \u201cengaged in abusive conduct during his tenure at Maryland,\u201d according to the report, and would \u201cattempt to humiliate teammates\u201d by throwing food, weights and, once, a trash can full of vomit. Some players described Court\u2019s actions as a motivational tactic, but the commission determined he crossed the line.\nAmid swirling stories, some details were consistent: Court\u2019s profanity was often \u201cexcessive and personal in nature,\u201d the report found. Court resigned in August.\n\u201cCourt\u2019s favorite words were p---- b----, calling people fat, bringing people\u2019s family into it,\u201d one former player told investigators, referring to derogatory terms for women.\nThe report notes that Court was never given a performance review.\nDurkin claims that it was not his responsibility to supervise Court, although it was Durkin\u2019s decision to hire him. They worked closely together every day, and Durkin delegated many responsibilities to Court. The head coach, the commission found, \u201cbears some responsibility when Mr. Court \u2026 exhibits unacceptable behavior.\u201d\n\u201cThe confusion over to whom Mr. Court reported is a striking illustration of the Athletics Department\u2019s disarray,\u201d the report reads.\nThe culture report is the second athletic investigation by the board of regents. The first review \u2014 the results of which were released Sept. 21 \u2014 was commissioned to analyze athletic department protocols and procedures related to McNair\u2019s death.\nThat report, led by sports medicine consultant Dr. Rod Walters, found athletics staff made a host of errors May 29, the day McNair fell ill during practice \u2014 including failing to immerse the offensive lineman in cold water, which experts say is in line with best practices.\nLoh has publicly said the school takes \u201clegal and moral responsibility\u201d for mistakes in treating the student-athlete.\nThe latest report contains much more extensive interviews with players, many of whom leveled scathing criticism against the team\u2019s culture.\nDespite that, the commission members said they didn\u2019t find a \u201cuniform rejection\u201d of the coaching staff. To meet the \u201ctoxic\u201d standard, the report states, the culture would have to be \u201cextremely harsh, malicious, or harmful.\u201d They determined it did not.\nIf the program had been truly toxic, the commission wrote, Durkin would not have earned the \u201cloyalty and respect\u201d of many players and their families, who have spoken out in support of him over the past several weeks.\nDurkin was interviewed for 10 hours, and the commission found \u201chis concern for his players\u2019 welfare is genuine.\u201d\nThe commission confronted the belief held by many that Durkin\u2019s and Court\u2019s tactics reflected those in \u201cbig time\u201d football programs across the country. Durkin modeled his program after Ohio State University\u2019s Urban Meyer and Michigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh, whom the report characterizes as \u201ctough, no-nonsense leaders.\u201d\nOne section of the review lays out that \u201cpushing the human body to its limit\u201d has always been a hallmark of sports.\n\u201cFootball is a \u2018gladiator sport\u2019 where pushing to and through exhaustion is celebrated,\u201d it states.\nIn anonymous surveys conducted with student-athletes, the Maryland football team\u2019s culture \u201cfared poorly\u201d compared with other college teams and Court\u2019s \u201cscores were extremely poor by any standard,\u201d the commission found. Players noted that \u201cscars lingered from Coach Court\u2019s abusive language and conduct during his first season.\u201d\nPlayer after player said coaches treated players harshly and disrespectfully, according to the report.\n}}

{{Goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes is held over claims he masterminded the kidnapping and execution of his former lover, Eliza Samudio\nOne of Brazil's best-known footballers was last night behind bars in a high-security Rio jail after allegations that he masterminded the abduction and execution of his former lover.\nPolice in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city, claimed that Bruno Fernandes, until recently captain and goalkeeper of Brazil's most popular club, Flamengo, plotted the killing of 25-year-old Eliza Samudio, who disappeared in June.\nEdson Moreira, the homicide investigator in charge of the case, told reporters that while fans saw Fernandes as an \"idol\", the footballer was \"a monster for what he did to this young lady\".\n\"Bruno was there and he saw how the woman was completely broken,\" he said. \"According to witnesses he accompanied Eliza to her sacrifice and to her death.\"\nSamudio, a former model and actor, reportedly met Fernandes last year at a party and became pregnant during their first encounter. Police believe the 25-year-old player was infuriated by her decision to keep the child, who is now four months old, and claim that Samudio was lured from Rio de Janeiro to Belo Horizonte, around six hours away by car, where she was killed by a former policeman named as Marcos Aparecido dos Santos.\nBefore her disappearance on 4 June Samudio had approached police to report receiving threats from the goalkeeper, who was recently linked with a multi-million dollar transfer to AC Milan. \"You don't know me and you don't know what I am capable of \u2013 I'm from the favela,\" he allegedly told her, according to a statement given to authorities in Rio and reproduced in the Brazilian press.\nWhile police have yet to find Samudio's body, investigators say they are certain she is dead, having been beaten, bound and then strangled in the former policeman's home. Police claim parts of her body were fed to a rottweiler.\nAccording to Moreira, Fernandes was present when Santos strangled the former model. Santos's lawyer last night said his client denied taking part in the killing.\n\"Shortly before dying, she said: 'I can't take being beaten any more',\" Moreira claimed, adding that her alleged killer had replied: \"You're not going to be beaten any more, you are going to die.\"\nAs the scandal grew yesterday and TV news channels gave the case virtually uninterrupted coverage, candidates in the upcoming presidential election spoke out. \"This is a barbaric crime,\" Dilma Rousseff, current president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's favoured successor, told the Record news channel. \"The whole of Brazil is disgusted by such a barbaric and perverse crime.\"\nMarina Silva, the rainforest defender who is also running for president in the October elections, told reporters the killing was part of a worrying trend of violence against women. \"We have repeatedly seen this kind of episode against the lives of women,\" she said.\nRecent months have seen increasing concern about the off-field actions of Brazil's high-earning footballers.\nIn May the Rio-born striker Adriano, who recently signed for Italian club AS Roma, was summoned for questioning after the Brazilian press uncovered photographs of him and a friend brandishing what appeared to be automatic rifles and making the sign for the Red Command drug faction with their hands.\nAdriano denied the reports, claiming that one of the rifles was a Philippe Starck lampshade in the shape of a gold plated AK-47. But his exclusion from Brazil's World Cup squad was largely attributed to his troubled personal life and other reports about Adriano have claimed he has links to one of Rio's most notorious gangsters.\nEarlier this year former CSKA Moscow striker Vagner Love found himself in hot water after police obtained a video showing the player at a dance party in Rio's largest slum, surrounded by men with assault rifles and a bazooka.\nSpeaking to the Guardian before the latest scandal involving Fernandes, the head of Rio's civil police, Allan Turnowski, said footballers who had grown up surrounded by drug traffickers needed to take greater care in their choice of friends.\n\"We know of their roots [in the favelas], the friendships they have there\u2026 But it is hard to explain to our kids \u2013 who see [these players] as idols \u2013 that [their idols] are hanging around with armed people, bad people, people who kill, rob and traffic drugs. [People] who do everything that we try and advise our children not to do,\" he said.\n\"The bad example they set for our children is what upsets us.\"\n}}

{{newsletters, sports-updates-summary,\nTHREE Hampden league footballers eager to play at the highest level they can are settling into their new VFL and WAFL homes. Former North Warrnambool Eagles small forward Dion Johnstone will try and reignite his AFL career after signing with VFL club Port Melbourne. Johnstone spent two years at Melbourne playing for the Demons\u2019 state league affiliate Casey where he spent time in defence. Cobden export Jackson Merrett will fly west to play for WAFL club Peel Thunder \u2013 AFL club Fremantle\u2019s affiliate \u2013 next year after 56 matches for Essendon. Ex-Terang Mortlake utility Scott Carlin has graduated from TAC Cup ranks and will try and swoop on a forward line spot for Werribee in 2019. But it is summer and cricket is also making headlines. The region hosted a Western Waves\u2019 under 14 Youth Premier League game on Sunday in Terang and will welcome a series of under 16 matches later this month in Port Fairy, Koroit and Warrnambool.

{{Head Coach Rex Ryan would have the sporting world believe that Sunday\u2019s AFC championship game between his New York Jets and the Indianapolis Colts is a struggle for the very soul of professional football.\nEven by the measure of a man whose mouth has won him the hearts of New Yorkers \u2013 no statement too brash, no prediction too bold \u2013 Ryan\u2019s comment of Jan. 6 was curious.\nWhy, he asked rhetorically, was his 9-7 team not the Super Bowl favorite?\n\u201cWe have the best defense\u2026. We have the best rushing attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had a choice to coach any team in this [postseason] tournament, I would choose this one.\"\nTo those immersed in the Xs and Os of modern football, the statement sounded like the relic of another era \u2013 as though the Jets coach was advocating a worldwide return to Commodore computers and 8-track cassettes.\nThe era of smashmouth football, the thinking goes, is over.\n\u201cThree yards and a cloud of dust\u201d seems like a quaint notion from the days when Red Grange roamed the gridiron wearing an aviator\u2019s cap. Defenses are no longer so feared that they invoke semi-apocalyptic nicknames: the Steel Curtain, the Doomsday Defense, the Monsters of the Midway.\nToday\u2019s NFL is dominated by passing \u2013 the elastic minds and arms of Mannings and Favres and Breeses \u2013 and those who suggest otherwise are muscle-headed luddites who don\u2019t know their time has passed them by.\nOr are they?\nThe Jet gospel\nRyan\u2019s run through the playoffs with the Jets this year has been accompanied by an almost Messianic fervor. His team steamrolled a fading Cincinnati Bengals outfit in the Wild Card round before persuading the San Diego Chargers to press their self-destruct button last week.\nBut even amid some good fortune, Ryan has remained unsurprisingly unabashed: His goal is to bring the forgotten gospel of bloody knuckles and splintered teeth back to football, one grind-it-out Jets win at a time.\nAlong the way, he has amassed quite a following.\nDespite its overwhelming popularity, the NFL has not reached its current pinnacle without some uneasiness among the blue-collar everyfan.\nThe league is, undoubtedly, now a quarterback\u2019s league. Evolving NFL rules protect the quarterback as though he were made out of Waterford crystal. The merest brush to his head by a defensive lineman brings terrible and immediate yellow-flagged retribution. Defensive backs have slowly been deprived of many of the tricks and tactics they once used to disrupt receivers, to the point that they can now seem little more than spectators.\nThis has accomplished the NFL\u2019s goal. It is now as exciting and offensive as at any moment in its history. This year, 10 quarterbacks threw for more than 4,000 yards. In 2000, three did. In 1990, only one did. In fact, more than half of the 4,000-plus yard seasons in NFL history have been amassed in the 10 years since 2000.\nBut it\u2019s not the sort of foggy-breathed, frozen-tundra-of-Lambeau-Field football that makes men lower their voices an octave and talk about \u201cwarriors\u201d and \u201cgladiators\u201d of the gridiron.\nIn short, the pretty boys have won. Both championship games today will be played in domes, for goodness sake. There, the field won\u2019t even be tundra, much less frozen.\nIn this way, the Jets \u2013 as much as powder-blue Houston Oilers uniforms or Tom Landry\u2019s fedora \u2013 are throwbacks. If they beat Peyton Manning and his Colts Sunday, they can call their defense Gang Green or D. Rex. They can strike a blow at the heart of pretty-boy football and its High King Manning.\nDefense wins championships (?)\nThe model the Jets will try to follow to the Super Bowl Sunday is one as old as the NFL and its working-class, teeth-chattering origins in the early winter of the upper Midwest. The traditions and playing styles established in those days and climes gave rise to football's prime maxim: Defense and a good running game wins championships.\nAnd so it was for much of football history.\nQuarterbacks were stewards of championship offenses \u2013 often gifted, but rarely given free rein. Super Bowls were won on the legs of runners and the backs of defensemen.\nDan Marino and Dan Fouts might spin the scoreboard like a pinwheel, but neither won a Super Bowl. Jeff Hostetler and Mark Rypien, however, have rings because they were cogs in a winning machine far greater than themselves.\nYet the slow upward arc of the passing game and its influence on the NFL \u2013 begun by Johnny Unitas and accelerated by Joe Montana \u2013 has seemingly now passed a tipping point. Of the four teams remaining in the postseason, for example, three have elite quarterbacks who threw for more than 4,000 yards this season: the Colts (Manning), Vikings (Brett Favre), and Saints (Drew Brees).\nThe Jets\u2019 Mark Sanchez may join those ranks one day, but as a rookie, he is the Jeff Hostetler of conference championship Sunday: His job is less to help his team than to avoid hurting it.\nYet one senses that the mountainous Ryan might prefer it this way.\n-----\nFollow us on Twitter.\n}}
{{\u201cI think they did everything that we expected them to do. We just didn\u2019t execute.\u201d -Harold Landry\nBoston College football\u2019s offense opened on Friday night the same way it has much of the year: A short play-action pass here, a run up the gut there, but, ultimately, a three-and-out that leads to a Mike Knoll punt.\nBut this time would be different. The Eagles, who have worked so diligently to perfect their special teams throughout practice this week, caught a break. Ray-Ray McCloud called for a fair catch, but allowed it to slip right through his fingers. The ball barely squirted behind McCloud, but a sea of Eagles were ready. John Johnson pounced on the ball, giving BC a first-and-goal from the 9-yard line. Against Clemson, the No. 3 team in the nation, it was the kind of special-teams swing the Eagles needed to pull off an upset.\nHere's another look at the muffed punt that gifted BC with great field position: pic.twitter.com/dLgsZBWP15 \u2014 Riley Overend (@RileyHeights) October 7, 2016\nRaucous cheers burst out from a student section decked out in maroon and gold, with the perfect hint of red for this year\u2019s Red Bandanna Game, in honor of Sept. 11 hero Welles Crowther, BC \u201999. Dreams of winning for Welles, just like BC did two years ago, 37-31, against then-No. 9 Southern California, drifted through Alumni Stadium on a perfect October Friday evening. Once again, students could rush the field and cheer alongside head coach Steve Addazio and a parade of proud Eagles.\nThose dreams never came. Neither did the roar of the crowd. Well, not from those wearing bandannas, at least.\nDefensively, BC, a team that entered No. 1 in the nation in yards per game, got burned by Deshaun Watson, Wayne Gallman, and the Clemson offense for 499 yards. Several of those came on plays of over 40 yards. And as its defense collapsed, BC\u2019s offense had no response. Turnovers and ineffectiveness plagued the Eagles throughout the night on their way to a 56-10 loss. It is the 11th consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference loss for the Eagles, who are without one since Nov. 29, 2014. The 56 points are the most the Eagles have allowed in the Addazio era.\nThe Eagles (3-3, 0-3 Atlantic Coast) controlled the ball throughout the game against the Tigers (6-0, 3-0). Addazio\u2019s run-heavy offense outpaced Dabo Swinney\u2019s fast-paced spread, 38:08 to 21:52. Yet, when they sniffed the end zone, they rarely executed.\nEarly in the second half, quarterback Patrick Towles led BC on an effective drive from its own 19-yard line. Towles threw two passes\u2014one for five yards to Michael Walker, another for 22 to Tommy Sweeney\u2014for first downs. Davon Jones, a redshirt-freshman running back and No. 2 on BC\u2019s depth chart, gained 16 yards on the ground. Jeff Smith tacked on a 26-yard double-reverse run, too. And down only a couple of touchdowns, BC had an opportunity to get back into it.\nBut there is something about drives within the one that has had BC fans squirming in the last two seasons.\nTowles attempted a QB sneak on 3rd-and-1, but was stopped just short. It was a hard play to make, considering center Jon Baker exited the game with an ankle injury. Jim Cashman, his replacement, had rarely played at the position. Addazio has stated that the biggest thing the Eagles need to do is remain healthy. Losing Baker, he said, was an absolute killer.\n\u201cHe could not go into the game [after the injury],\u201d Addazio said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t push off it or anything else. You know, you\u2019ve got a lot of fears. One of my fears was losing that guy, and that happened.\u201d\nBut, instead of dropping back into the huddle, the Eagles opted to hurry up. Towles fumbled the snap, eliciting a different kind of sound from the student section.\nFortunately for the Eagles, they received new life on a Clemson offsides. They responded by running the same play up the middle. Both failed, causing a turnover on downs. At 6-foot-5, Towles was sure he had a score on his first attempt. On his second, he knew the errors were no one\u2019s but his own.\n\u201cThe first one, I thought I did [get in there],\u201d Towles said. \u201cThe next one, we had a new center, and I have to do a better job at getting the snaps. That\u2019s my fault.\u201d\nIt was the first of two turnovers caused by Towles. The second came on BC\u2019s first real two-minute drill of the season. Down 18, the Eagles got the ball back at their 31-yard line. Tyler Rouse ran for 17 yards, and Towles threw two 10+ yard passes to Sweeney and Jones. On Clemson\u2019s 23-yard line with under a minute remaining, the Eagles had an opportunity to jump back in the game.\nIt was, again, a dream that never came to be.\nUnable to find an open receiver, Towles attempted to scramble on a 1st-and-10. He got hit by Clemson star linebacker Ben Boulware, a tackle that made Towles\u2019s head snap back. The play made Towles fumble the ball, his fourth lost fumble in six games. Afterward, he recognized the importance of holding the ball better.\nInitially, the referees bailed Towles out. They called Boulware on a targeting penalty, meaning 15 yards and an ejection. On further review, however, Boulware had not hit Towles in the head, but rather pushed him with two hands in the shoulder pads. The play was overturned, keeping Boulware in the game and giving Clemson the ball. Addazio, though visibly distraught in the moment, recognized that questioning the refs\u2019 decisions now would be futile, even if he disagreed with some calls throughout the game.\n\u201cAll I can tell you is what flashed in front of my eyes,\u201d Addazio said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to it. I wasn\u2019t close enough to see it. I\u2019m not going to speak to all the officiating things that went on in the game, I\u2019m just not going to do it. There\u2019s too many for me to even count right now to be honest with you, okay.\u201d\nMeanwhile, that BC defense that averaged 202 yards allowed per game\u2014again, fewest in the nation\u2014had no response for the might of Watson, a Heisman Trophy front-runner, and Gallman, one of the nation\u2019s best runners.\nImmediately after the fumble drive, Watson completed three passes before handing the ball off to Gallman. The Eagles had it caged, but Ty Schwab missed the initial tackle before Gallman bounced back to the perimeter and outran BC\u2019s defense for 59 yards and a score.\nWayne Gallman takes it 59 yards to the house to give Clemson a 7-3 lead in the first quarter #CLEMvsBC pic.twitter.com/RYYsHXhSSs \u2014 Riley Overend (@RileyHeights) October 7, 2016\nBC\u2019s response: a first down, then a seven-yard loss.\nOn Clemson\u2019s following drive, Watson took to the air. He placed a superb pass over the head of Isaac Yiadom, right into the hands of a diving Mike Williams. That pass set Clemson up within BC\u2019s red zone, where Watson again went to the air. He aimed for Williams once more. This time, Williams leapt high over Gabriel McClary, who had no idea the ball was coming until the referees raised their hands for a score.\nDeshaun Watson connects with Williams again for the score.

The fast pace got even faster. Like, one play kind of fast.\nClemson\u2019s Jordan Leggett found a hole over the middle of the field, with no maroon and gold in sight. Watson saw the opening too, and Leggett dashed through the middle of the field. McClary, John Johnson, and Kamrin Moore all had a chance to tackle the tight end. Each one missed him.\n1 play. 56 yards. Deshaun Watson is heating up as Clemson leads BC 21-3 late in the first quarter #CLEMvsBC pic.twitter.com/TXPsbumOuC \u2014 Riley Overend (@RileyHeights) October 8, 2016\n\u201cThose three plays were costly right there,\u201d Addazio said.\nStill, the Eagles could have mounted a comeback in the second half. A 21-3 deficit isn\u2019t completely insurmountable (for most offenses, at least). But the Tigers never took their feet off the pedal. Watson tossed another two touchdowns, of 29 and 16 yards to Deon Cain, both with McClary covering. He finished the day throwing 14 of 24 passes for 266 yards and four touchdowns. Addazio repeated after the game that his secondary had good coverage on some plays, but when it mattered most to get off the field, the Eagles couldn\u2019t execute.\n\u201cWe were trying to mix and match it\u2014some man, some zone, some man, some zone,\u201d Addazio said. \u201cI thought we did a good job with that, but in the process, we let up too many big plays.\u201d\nDespite a Towles touchdown pass to his fullback, Bobby Wolford, Swinney went to his backups in the fourth. Gallman, who rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown on nine carries, gave way to his two backups: Tavien Feaster and Tyshon Dye. Each added touchdowns of their own. Mark Fields capped it off with a 42-yard interception return on a Darius Wade pass.\nThere are a lot of plays for Addazio to digest throughout the game. They\u2019ll have two weeks to fix them with the bye on the horizon before a visit from Syracuse.\nBut if he wants to dissect anything, he should start on that first offensive possession. That fumble\u2014a huge, momentum-shifting play on special teams\u2014turned into only a 24-yard field goal from Knoll. Instead of applying the pressure early, the Eagles got a consolation prize.\nIt was the first sign of many to come that dreams of an upset would soon turn into nightmares of reality.\nFeatured Image by Julia Hopkins / Heights Editor | Gallery by Amelie Trieu / Heights Editor and Julia Hopkins / Heights Editor\n}}

{{BARCELONA (REUTERS) - Real Madrid turned down the opportunity to sign goalkeeper David de Gea from Manchester United last summer, club president Florentino Perez said on Tuesday while playing down the possibility of bidding for the Spain international again.\nReal were on the verge of bringing former Atletico Madrid goalkeeper de Gea back to Spain in 2015 but the move, which included sending current Real custodian Keylor Navas to United as a makeweight, was derailed as the clubs failed to close the deal before the transfer window closed.\nCosta Rica goalkeeper Navas was criticised at several points last season for unconvincing displays which cost Real points leading to reports in the Spanish media that the club would make another move for de Gea.\nNavas' form improved towards the end of the campaign, however, as his side won the LaLiga and Champions League double.\nPerez said Real were not looking to replace Navas or deputy Kiko Casilla.\n\"Two years ago we had the disaster of the late fax, they (United) sent it two minutes late and that was it,\" Perez said in an interview with Spanish daily Marca on Tuesday, the day after earning a third consecutive mandate with Real.\n\"Last year we had the chance to sign him but we didn't take it and now we don't have any agreement with Manchester United to sign him. The truth is we have great goalkeepers.\"\nReal were unable to strengthen their squad in the January transfer window due to a transfer ban for illegally signing minors but since the sanction was lifted, they have been linked with a raft of players like France forward Kylian Mbappe and AC Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nThe future of all-time top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo and fellow forwards Alvaro Morata and James Rodriguez has, however, been thrown into doubt, although Perez said Real have not started conducting their business yet.\nThe construction magnate, however, did confirm Real had signed defender Theo Hernandez from arch-rivals Atletico, even though the move has not yet been made official.\n\"In the days since the Champions League final, no one has offered us anything for any player and everything that has come out in the media is not true, apart from the case of Theo, which was done before,\" he added.\n}}
{{Singapore clinched the Asian Cup in sports table football for the third year running on June 11.\nA two-day tournament in Tokyo saw a team from Singapore defeat Australia 2-1, and Japan 4-0, in the Nations event to win the title.\nSingapore had previously won the Cup in 2015 when it was hosted in Melbourne, and last year, when it hosted the event.\nThis year's team consisted of players Bernard Lim, Tan Kok Wee, John Ho, Vikas Chandiramani, Ashley Tan and John William Edwards.\nDuring a team match, each team will have one player serving as a substitute while the other four players play one-on-one matches at four separate tables. One round is made up of two 15-minute halves.\nIn addition to the Nations title, Singapore's Tan also won the title of Asian Cup Champion in the individual Open category, defeating high-ranking players from France, Italy and Wales before finishing with a 2-1 win over Australia's Raffaele Lombardi.\nAlso known as \"subbuteo\", sports table football resembles a conventional game of football in many respects, such as its rules, except that it is played on a table with plastic figures flicked to the ball using the index finger.\nThe game first became popular in Singapore in the 1980s. However, interest declined in the early 90s when the game producer Hasbro ceased to manufacture new sets.\nNevertheless, a competitive playing community continued to thrive, with the establishment of the Table Football Association of Singapore (TFAS) in 2009.\nThere are currently two established table football clubs in Singapore - SG Lions TFC, which plays at the Sports Hub Library on alternate Sundays and every Thursday evening at the Kebun Baru Heights Residents Committee Centre, and the Jurong Central Subbuteo Club, which meets every Friday evening at the Jurong Central Zone D Residents' Committee Centre.\nIn addition to running a national league, TFAS organises three nation-wide competitions every year, open to players across the region.\nThe best players in Singapore compete regularly at regional competitions, while several players have participated in the Federation of International Sports Table Football (FISTF) world championship.\nTo date, about 40 national sports table football federations have registered with FISTF. There are approximately 5,000 registered players worldwide.\n}}

{{news, latest-news,\nPORT Fairy coach Dan Nicholson is buoyant about the fresh faces scattered throughout the Hampden league premiership contender\u2019s side. The Seagulls had six inclusions from their 2017 grand final team in their season-opening win against Cobden on Saturday. Jaise Coleman, Lachie Chapman, Johnny Bell, Lachie Glare and David West joined high-profile recruit Matt Pitt in purple and gold. Nicholson said the contingent brought varying skillsets to the Seagulls\u2019 dynamic. Northern Territory-based tall Coleman and Chapman, who was at Laverton, have played at Port Fairy in the past. \u201cI haven\u2019t really worked out where to play him at the moment,\u201d Nicholson said of Coleman. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty light but he\u2019s almost like a mobile wingman, so that\u2019s where we played him in the last quarter and he got into the game really well. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost Adam Farley who is that sort of agricultural defender and Chappy\u2019s just stepped into that role really well.\u201d Bell has crossed from South West District league club Heywood where he was a prolific scorer. He has started in defence for Port Fairy. \u201cJohnny\u2019s just played a lot of footy, is experienced and strong, so he was exceptional down back today,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cAnyone that said he might struggle at the standard at his age...he\u2019s 34 or 35 but as you can see, he keeps himself in tip-top shape.\u201d\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/e3vt5tmWYBffUEHF7QePjS/29d5dd9c-6899-4165-856b-0d2a538bfbb6.jpg/r77_437_3373_2299_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n}}
{{When Matt Nagy started his NFL coaching career, Eagles coach Doug Pederson was Philadelphia\u2019s offensive-quality-control coach. Nagy was below him.\n\u201cThe assistant to the assistant,\u201d Nagy said Monday.\nWhen Pederson was promoted to Eagles quarterbacks coach, Nagy followed behind, becoming the offensive-quality-control coach. When the two followed coach Andy Reid to Kansas City in 2013, Pederson became the offensive coordinator, Nagy the quarterbacks coach.\n\u201cSo we keep following this path here,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cSo I told [Pederson] at the owners meetings this past offseason that he got that Super Bowl. I\u2019m trying to follow his lead here.\nBears inside linebacker Danny Trevathan talks to side judge Dyrol Prioleau on Sunday. | Bruce Kluckhohn/AP photo\n\u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t want to hear that right now. But I\u2019m trying to stick on that path.\u201d\nA year ago, Pederson was the hotshot play-caller with no playoff experience as a head coach. Nagy, and his Bears, inherited that mantle this season.\nPlayoff football is different. The Eagles, who won the Super Bowl last season, know that. The Bears are about to find out.\n\u201cThe intensity is completely different,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close.\u201d\nThe greatest playoff-experience disparity Sunday will be at quarterback. Nick Foles is the reigning Super Bowl MVP and is making his third trip to the postseason as a starter.\nThe Bears\u2019 Mitch Trubisky, meanwhile, has started exactly one postseason game since graduating high school: a loss to Stanford in the 2016 Sun Bowl.\nEntering the game against Pederson\u2019s Eagles, the Bears have only seven starters with postseason experience \u2014 25 games\u2019 worth.\nBy contrast, 12 of the Eagles\u2019 starters in their Week 17 victory against the Redskins also started in Super Bowl LII. Those 12 have 52 games\u2019 worth of playoff experience \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting offseason pickup Michael Bennett, who played in two Super Bowls and totaled 10 career playoff games with the Seahawks.\nNagy, though, said the Bears gained a glimpse of postseason intensity in their 24-10 victory against the Vikings, who were playing at home for their playoff lives.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a playoff game, but it was close to it,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cAnd so those guys felt it, they were on the road. Everything\u2019s faster. It\u2019s a lot faster.\u201d\nTrubisky responded well.\n\u201cMitch had a great game,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cHe was a leader of the offense.\u201d\nGiven the Bears\u2019 TV exposure this year, the big stage won\u2019t be new to Trubisky or his teammates.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a feel to it,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got everybody there. Everybody\u2019s watching. The good thing for us is we\u2019ve had some Sunday night games, some Monday night games, some Thursday night games, where this isn\u2019t our first rodeo. So I know how our guys handle it, and now it\u2019s just the deal \u2014 if you lose, you\u2019re done. If you win, you keep moving on.\u201d\nSome of the Bears\u2019 best players, though, have been through the rigors of the postseason.\nRELATED\n\u2022 There will be nothing louder at rowdy Soldier Field than the Bears\u2019 defense\n\u2022 Film Study: Five takeaways from the Bears\u2019 24-10 win against the Vikings\nTight end Trey Burton threw the touchdown pass on the \u201cPhilly Special\u201d in Super Bowl LII.

{{SAN RAMON \u2014 Turnovers often determine a winner on the gridiron.\nThat certainly was the case Friday night at California, which lost a pair of fumbles that visiting Monte Vista turned into touchdowns to prevail 23-13 in an East Bay Athletic League Mountain Division opener for both teams.\n\u201cBeing able to take advantage of mistakes is a staple of good football,\u201d Monte Vista coach Matt Russi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always do it, but we were able to do it tonight.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a flawless performance for the Mustangs (5-1, 1-0 EBAL), who couldn\u2019t execute on a 22-yard field goal try with 9:57 left in the fourth quarter. A bad snap became a 10-yard loss and a turnover on downs.\nTrailing 16-13, this was as chance for Cal (4-2, 0-1) to embark on a game-winning drive.\nBut three plays later, Monte Vista senior David Hayward \u2014 all 6-foot-4, 235 pounds of him \u2014 recovered a fumble inside a pile up.\nOn the next snap, quarterback Jack Stewardson hurled a 34-yard touchdown off a play-action fake to a streaking Matt Prochaska with 8:43 remaining.\n\u201cWe ran it earlier in the game and it didn\u2019t work out as planned, so we came back to it and it worked,\u201d said Stewardson, who saw the secondary collapse into the middle of the field as his wide receiver came free off a wheel route. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing all week.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the type of play the coaching staff draws up with the hope the players can execute on game day.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been harping on playing mistake-free football and really dialing in on those minute, little details and just keep improving,\u201d Russi said. \u201cAnd you could see it today.\u201d\nStewardson finished 10 of 15 for 124 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He also used his legs at opportune times for TD runs of 4 and 1 yards, but most of the tough sledding between the tackles was split between junior Tyler Perry (15 carries, 69 yards) and sophomore Gavin Cribb (26 carries, 136 yards).\n\u201cThe way we ran the ball today was awesome,\u201d Russi said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a quarterback that can sling it, but we didn\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\u201cWe deserve to lose playing the way we did,\u201d Cal coach Eric Billeci said. \u201cMonte Vista took it to us all night. They were more physical and they were just a better team tonight than we were.\u201d For more Bay Area high school sports coverage follow Bay Area Preps on Flipboard.\nMonte Vista opened the game with a 16-play, 78-yard drive that ate up nearly 7 minutes off the clock and ended with a 4-yard keeper by Stewardson to go up 7-0.\nThe touchdown, though, wasn\u2019t as tough a blow for Cal as the right-leg injury to sophomore defensive lineman Beni Hingano.\nPlay halted for roughly 20 minutes, as an aircast was placed around his leg and Hingano was carted off to an ambulance on the track.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good way to start the game, obviously, but we did battle back for him,\u201d said Billeci, who didn\u2019t have an immediate update on the injury after the game.\nThe Grizzlies shook off the injury and drove 78 yards of their own on eight plays to tie the game on 3-yard jet sweep by Jahmal Cornwell with 1:04 left in the first quarter.\nMonte Vista regained the lead midway through the second quarter on a 28-yard field goal by Matthew Hoffman.\nAfter the ensuing kickoff, inside linebacker Mikie Roy pounced on a fumble on the third play from scrimmage.\n\u201cThroughout the game Monte Vista was more physical than we were and we just didn\u2019t execute well enough at all,\u201d Billeci said.\nIt took the Mustangs five plays to find the end zone again, with a 15-yard completion to Cribb leaving the ball next to the goal line for Stewardson\u2019s second rushing TD.\n\u201cWe have the big-play ability and they tried to take that away from us,\u201d Russi said. \u201cSo our answer to that was let\u2019s just execute the small things, keep moving the ball, keep getting positive gains.\u201d\nAnd just avoid making any mistakes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Stewardson said of the road victory. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the toughest opponents we\u2019ll play in league and we\u2019ll keep moving forward from here on out.

And it wouldn\u2019t do her any good either.\u201d\nWATCH: Saudi teen fleeing abusive family arrives in Canada, welcomed by Chrystia Freeland\nHorak said that while it\u2019s inevitable that the Al-Qunun case will worsen tensions in the short term, Canada could mitigate the damage by maintaining an open line of communication with Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s time to let her settle in and then work and talk with the Saudis and explain to them why we did what we did, and perhaps that can mitigate some of the damage that may occur,\u201d said Horak.\nWATCH: Saudi teen fleeing family granted asylum in Canada\nThe case has also sparked concerns about possible Saudi retaliation against the 20,000 Canadians who live in the Arab world\u2019s richest country.\nLast month, two Canadian men were arrested in China amid tensions between Ottawa and Beijing over the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.\nMichael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain in Chinese custody after being arrested on suspicion of spying and endangering national security.\nREAD MORE: Chinese ambassador pens op-ed on Canadian detainees, slams \u2018Western egotism and white supremacy\u2019\nHorak said it\u2019s unlikely that Saudi Arabia would resort to similar tactics, although he stated that Canadian expats in the kingdom might encounter other difficulties.\n\u201cIn my view, a lot of the Canadians that are there are doing valuable work, so I don\u2019t think I would see them being arrested for example as we\u2019ve seen in China,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey may encounter \u2014 and I think some have already since the summertime \u2014 difficulty with things like visa renewals or contract renewals\u2026 or if they\u2019re looking for new jobs with other companies, Canadians may not be the preferred citizenship for prospective employers.\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be overly concerned about arrests and things.\u201d\nWATCH: Ottawa delegation in China as two Canadians remain detained\nHorak said it\u2019s vital that diplomatic relations don\u2019t become strained to the point that Canada and Saudi Arabia shutter their embassies in each other\u2019s territories.\n\u201cThat would certainly not be in Canada\u2019s interests and I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen,\u201d he said, although he cautioned that \u201coverreaction cannot be ruled out\u201d on the part of the Saudis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that Canada be there, it\u2019s important that Canada have an embassy there to offer protections, normal consular services and consular protections that are best delivered when there\u2019s an embassy on the ground,\u201d he said.\nConcerns of diplomatic tensions aside, Horak credited Al-Qunun\u2019s case for shining a spotlight on Saudi Arabia\u2019s guardianship laws which curtail women\u2019s freedom.\n\u201cWhen I was there, Saudi women talked to me a lot about the guardianship laws. The West was talking all about driving and they said, \u2018no that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m driving, that\u2019s fine\u2019 but the real issue for them is the guardianship laws,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s possible that Al-Qunun\u2019s case will spur a renewed examination of guardianship laws, Horak said, although he warned it could also spark a conservative backlash, with families further tightening restrictions on daughters.\nNOW is the time for #Saudi (and UAE and other Arab states) to end arcane and often cruel male guardianship over women, so that they can travel and marry as they wish. THREAD: https://t.co/tuuSY0IVza pic.twitter.com/bacWP5i1lg \u2014 Human Rights Watch (@hrw) January 6, 2019\nAs far as Al-Qunun\u2019s future goes, Horak said it\u2019s important to let her take her time to settle into Canadian life rather than force her to become a mouthpiece against Saudi human rights abuses.\n\u201cI think she needs to have time to settle in and if she decides down the road that she wants to be an activist and be very vocal on this, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut that should be up to her and not something that we push her into.\u201d\n\u2014 With files from Grant MacDonald\nFollow @Kalvapalle\n}}
{{Posted Wednesday, November 7, 2018 12:46 am\nGREENVILLE \u2014 There will be spots for varsity football teams from Winterville South Central at D.H. Conley in the North Carolina High School Athletic Association postseason.\nFollowing an NCHSAA investigation from a postgame alteraction that broke out between the teams following the conclusion of their 3-A/4-A Eastern Carolina Conference championship game last week, the NCHSAA handed down fines and player suspensions to both schools, but each team retained their playoff eligibility.\nAccording to a release from Pitt County Schools, several students were also banned from games for the remainder of the season after fans stormed the field following the conclusion of play, which contributed to the melee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to have such a great game marred by the interactions between fans, players and coaches. We have been investigating internally at each school and cooperating with NCHSAA officials to determine the course of action and any discipline that may be handed down,\u201d Pitt County Schools athletic director Ron Butler said.\nBoth head coaches, Nate Conner of Conley and Andy Tew of South Central, are also required to take the National Federation of High Schools Teaching and Modeling Behavior course before the next game. Conley and South Central administrators do not intend to appeal the NCHSAA\u2019s ruling, the release said.\n\u201cWe accept the decisions and are looking to move forward,\u201d South Central athletic director Chris Cherry said.\nSouth Central won the game 28-27, and the first round of the playoffs are scheduled for Nov. 16. Each team has a game scheduled for the extra regular-season week this Friday, with Conley visiting West Craven and South Central venturing to Hertford County.\n\u201cWe have reviewed the penalties and have accepted them with no plans of appealing,\u201d Conley athletic director Rob Maloney said. \u201cWe also plan to use this experience as a teachable moment for all of our student athletes, coaches and fans. In addition, we wish South Central the best of luck in the playoffs.\u201d\nHunt and Fike were involved in their own postgame altercation following Fike\u2019s 28-0 victory last week, a scene which caused Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s deputies to deploy pepper spray. However, Wilson County Schools announced Monday that it was ending the season for both teams. Hunt had one regular-season game remaining and both teams were eligible for the playoffs.\n}}

{{One of the greatest fights I ever saw occurred about 20 years ago on Thanksgiving in Uncle Gerald's living room. Uncle Gerald was a devout football fan, a Chicago Bears follower long before William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry was a twinkie in his father's eye. His wife, my dear Aunt Peggy, was an all- league cook and first-team holiday hostess. And therein lied the rub.\nShe demanded the television be turned off out of respect for this ceremonious feast, calling for a delay of game as it were. Uncle Gerald stubbornly relented each Thanksgiving, feeling he owed it to that poor woman who had been up since 5 a.m. making gravy and shining silver.\nA traditionalist, Aunt Peggy always managed to mention the Pilgrims before the pumpkin pie arrived -- ala mode, of course. Pilgrims? All Uncle Gerald could think about were Packers and Lions and Rams. Seated at the head of the table, he stole glances at the clock and set the Guinness record for fastest eating, nearly sweating blood over the thought of missing the greatest touchdown run in NFL history. (There were no replays or VCRs then, folks).\nBut on this particular Thanksgiving, Uncle Gerald's Bears were facing the Lions, who started this whole thing of playing football and terrorizing wives and children about 50 years ago.\n\"But honey, it's the Bears!\" Uncle Gerald pleaded.\nAunt Peggy's glare could have melted Dick Butkus.\nShe turned off the TV. Uncle Gerald turned it back on. Off, on, off, on, off, on. Their voices grew louder. \"You can't give up one game on Thanksgiving Day? If you want to watch it so bad go to our room and watch it in there. By yourself. And no turkey.\"\nAs I remember, it was a wonderful meal, interrupted only by the occasional cheers coming from a room down the hall.\nUncle Gerald just couldn't give it up. Not cold turkey, anyway.\nFootball and Thanksgiving. It's a tradition. A good meal and a good game. Millions of fans across the country will stuff themselves with rolls and roll- out passes. Today you can have seconds -- and thirds.\nThe bill of football fare begins with the Lions against the New York Jets at 12:30 p.m. (NBC, WESH-Ch. 2). Isn't it always heartwarming to see Merlin Olsen, the old quarterback-killer, get all misty-eyed telling you what Thanksgiving means to him? Next up it's the Dallas Cowboys against the St. Louis Cardinals at 4 p.m. (CBS, WCPX, Ch. 6) with Brent Musburger and John Madden, everybody's favorite uncle.\nTime for just a short nap because there's more.\nAt 8 p.m., over turkey sandwiches and leftover salad, it's time for a helping of college action: Texas plays Texas A&M; (ESPN) with the winner earning a berth in the Cotton Bowl.\nAnd as long as men are going to crash into each other every Thanksgiving, you might as well know how it all got started.\nThe Lions really didn't invent football on Thanksgiving, although it seems that way. High schools and colleges were doing it long before the Lions became the first pro team to play on Thanksgiving back in '34. Exactly how long, nobody seems to know, but Haverford (Pa.) High School was scheduled to play Upper Darby this morning for the 63rd consecutive Thanksgiving.\nThe Lions' game today marks the 46th time they have been home for the holiday (they took a six-year hiatus from 1939-44). George A. Richards, one of the NFL's pioneer movers and shakers, brought the turkey day game to the pros. He purchased the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans, a four-year-old member of the NFL, and moved them to Detroit in 1934.\nDetroit wasn't too crazy about the Lions. Richards needed to boost ticket sales.\nNoticing that big crowds were showing up for high school and college games on Thanksgiving, he arranged for the Lions to play the Chicago Bears. The Bears, just as they are in 1985, were a hot item. They had captured the first NFL championship game the year before, and had Red Grange and Bronko Nagurski in the backfield.\nRichards' Thanksgiving gimmick worked beyond his dreams. The game was a sellout at the University of Detroit Stadium (26,000) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. The previous high home crowd was 18,000.\nRichards also happened to be a close friend of Deke Aylesworth, president of the National Broadcasting Co. The game was aired coast-to-coast by 94 radio stations.\nTurkey Day Football caught on. The Lions have averaged more than 70,000 since 1975, when they moved into the space-age Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. Last year, according to Nielsen Ratings, 49 percent of the home TV sets -- some 18 million -- were tuned to the Lions' game against Green Bay.\nNetwork exposure of the pro game all but killed the traditional Thanksgiving matchups in the high school and college ranks. In 1950, 50 college games were played on Thanksgiving, but now there are only a few.\nTV brought Thanksgiving football into America's homes in 1956, with the Lions playing the Packers. Coupled with the NFL's emerging marketing talents, it became clear that if one Thanksgiving game was a good attraction then two ought to be even better. In 1966, the emerging Dallas Cowboys played the Cleveland Browns on a foggy Thanksgiving evening and celebrated the occasion by clinching their first winning season.\nFor all their fuss over the game, the Lions mostly have been turkeys (21-22-1) on Thanksgiving. The Cowboys are better, 13-3-1.\nBut enough history. Let's have some fun.\nRoy \"Friday\" Macklem won't have Thanksgiving dinner today. He says it's no big deal: he didn't eat turkey from 1936 to 1980 when he was the Lions' equipment manager. \"By the time we got the locker room cleaned up and got out of there, it was too late,\" said Macklem, 70, who is now retired. \"I just don't pay much attention to it now.\"\nMacklem is best remembered for being the perpetrator of The Great Turkey Hunt.\n}}

Those who fail to get a ticket will regret missing the electric atmosphere, with a star-studded closing ceremony in the lead up to the highly charged final.\n\u201cI bought my ticket as soon as they came online,\u201d said Ashfaq Ali Khan, a businessman in Karachi\u2019s busy electronics market. \u201cI watch most of the matches in my shop, but for a PSL match and that too on a Sunday, I could not resist.\u201d\nWithout a doubt, double World Twenty20 winning former West Indies captain Daren Sammy will be the star attraction. Since the inaugural edition of the HBL PSL, Sammy has become an official ambassador of the league.\nSo vibrant are his displays on the field and his emotional and loving words for Pakistan, its people and its hospitality that Sammy has become one of Pakistan\u2019s own. \u201cI am dying to get a selfie with Sammy,\u201d said Rummana Salim, a student of \u2018A\u2019 Levels in a local college. \u201cI missed a chance last year, but this time I hope he wins the final and comes close to our stand. I pray that situation in our country becomes so easy going that we can go closer to the players and get autographs and photos with them. I am sure it\u2019s around the corner.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s Shane Watson is another player in demand, touring Pakistan for the first time in 14 years. \u201cI want Watson to score a century in the final,\u201d said Nelson Maseeh, who works in a television channel. \u201cI am lucky that I took a selfie with him the other day in the team hotel. He was very caring and listened to me for five minutes.\u201d\nFans have come from as far as Lahore, where three matches were scheduled this year but were shifted to Karachi due to logistical and operational challenges.\nOnce such fan in Chacha PSL, a newly formed character. \u201cI took a train from Lahore on 8 March and have since watched all the matches in Karachi,\u201d said Mohammad Iqbal, who wears a green Pakistan flag shirt. \u201cPeople here are so caring that every day I get a match ticket to watch the match. This is a real tradition of Pakistan that people care about each other.\u201d\nWhen action will begin, both the teams will have support as they are equally popular among the crowd. While Peshawar\u2019s yellow dominates the stands to create a \u201cyellow storm\u201d, Quetta\u2019s purple is bright and attracts its fans.\n}}
{{SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL VIDEO\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, President Obama said that a substantial number of the 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq would be home within a year, saying Iraqis were now ready to take more responsibility for their own security.\nAsked whether a substantial number of troops would be home in time for next year's Super Bowl, Obama replied: \"Yes. We are going to roll out in a very formal fashion what our intentions are in Iraq as well as Afghanistan.\"\nObama also seemed to indicate that he intends to be proactive at engaging terrorist groups and insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan: \"We have to make sure we don't let up because there are people out there who want to do us harm.\"\nWATCH THE VIDEO:\nDressed casually, in an open-collared checkered shirt, Obama also discussed football, his Blackberry, the stimulus package, his relationship with Republicans and even laughed at the fact that he was bumped for Jessica Simpson on a recent issue of Us Weekly.\nAs to the fate of the stimulus package currently before the Senate, Obama expressed confidence that it would be passed but also demonstrated his disappointment that not a single Republican voted for the package when it was approved by the House last week - despite his best efforts to engage GOP leaders.\nHe said that he had done \"extraordinary outreach to Republicans because they have some good ideas and I want to make sure that those ideas are incorporated.\"\nIn a sign of his ambition to get the package passed and expression of his desire for the Pittsburgh Steelers to win the Super Bowl against the Arizona Cardinals, Obama joked that he would refrain from waving his Steelers' Terrible Towel because \"we have some Arizona congressman [such as presidential opponent, Senator John McCain] and I might need their vote on the recovery.\"\nHe also opened up about his daughters' experience at their new school, the prestigious Sidwell Friends School. \"They're loving school, they're making friends, have some friends from school over today.

If you touched it, it might blow up. It turns into a car if I have to make a quick getaway.\"\nWhen Lauer asked about who has the coveted number, Obama said he wouldn't give it to Lauer but he might give it to Lauer's young son Jack, prompting Lauer to whisper, \"Jack, give it to your pappa.\"\n}}
{{CON man, cheat, chancer... they're all words that could be associated with Carlos Kaiser, the greatest footballer never to play football. But he's far too charming for those labels.\nThe former Brazilian player has been called a fake footballer for creating a career out of zero talent for the game.\n27 Carlos Kaiser is known as the 'Farce Footballer'\nNow 55, Carlos was signed by a host of clubs, including giants such as Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense, Vasco da Gama and many other teams during a career that spanned two decades.\nHis astonishing story features in a brilliant new documentary by director Louis Myles and Irish producers Dr. Tom Markham and Rob Fullam called 'Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never To Play Football.'\nThe title stems from a nickname the protagonist earned because of his resemblance to Franz Beckenbauer in his youth.\nHis real name is Carlos Henrique Raposo.\nSomehow, he never played a professional match in his life, bouncing from club to club while hiding his limited ability by faking injury the moment it dawned on him his secret might get sprung.\n27 For 26-years, Kaiser bounced from club to club\nKaiser's party trick was to manipulate powerful figures at each club and boast of his CV to Presidents.\nA master influencer, he knew how to sell himself better than Steve Jobs flogging Apple products.\nAnd in an age where there was no internet, who would argue with the dashing gent?\nThe likes of Bebeto, Carlos Alberto, Zico, Junior, Renato Gaucho all speak in the movie about the incredible tale that slips between fantasy and reality.\nIn fact, Bebeto once said of his former teammate and pal: \u201cHis chat was so good that if you let him open his mouth, that would be it.\n\"He\u2019d charm you. You couldn\u2019t avoid it. That would be it.\u201d\n27 An ID that Kaiser got for his days at Ajaccio\nBorn in Porto Alegre in a neighbourhood called Moinhos de Vento, Kaiser claimed he was kidnapped at seven-years-old and brought to Rio de Janeiro in 1970.\nHe lived in Botafogo and was brought up by a wealthy adopted father and alcoholic mother.\n\"My adopted father was well off, but my mum was crooked. My mum was everything bad you could think of,\" he said.\n\"She was an alcoholic. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink. I have an aversion to drink because I had to live with an alcoholic when I was young.\n27 'Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never To Play Football' is out in cinemas July 26\n\"Life was tough because my mum didn\u2019t want my dad to support us because she was too proud. I would deliver lunch boxes. I worked in supermarkets, all while I had to train.\"\nAs a young boy Kaiser fell in love with the game. It was only as he got older, he confessed, that he found himself being more of a liaison for his teammates.\n\"I liked playing football, but I didn\u2019t like being a professional. I was basically a minder.\n\"I was at the club more to take care of the players\u2019 lives and make sure nothing bad happened to them.\n27 Kaiser appears on the Brazilian version of Match of the Day called 'Mesa Redonda'\n\"How can I explain\u2026. I\u2019ve taken the blame for a lot of famous players. I was a football nanny.\n\"I was the one who got sponsors and cash advances for the players.\n\"Whenever a club president wanted to get rid of me, the players would get together and ask them not to because I brought a lot of value to the club. I bonded the group together.\"\nKaiser was having a kickabout in his neighbourhood when scouts spotted his talents.\n27 A handsome man in his day, Kaiser was never short of female admirers\n\"I was playing street football when two scouts from Botafogo asked my dad who the kid with big hair was.\n\"He said ,'That\u2019s my son'. So they said bring him to Botafogo at 7am for trial. That was on Sunday for Monday morning. I didn\u2019t even have boots. They gave me boots that were too big.\"\nIt didn't work out for Kaiser at Botafogo and he soon found himself at Flamengo on the advice of Brazil international Junior, so he claimed.\nHowever, during a trial game Kaiser said he was mistakenly sent off instead of a player that looked like him, which got the young forward the sack from the Rio club.\n27 Kaiser made friends in the game, including Renato Gaucho, right,\nAt 16, he earned his first professional contract with Mexican club Puebla, only to be released months later without playing a single game.\nWhen he returned to Brazil, he befriended the likes of Carlos Alberto Torres, Ricardo Rocha and Renato Ga\u00facho.\nA renowned party boy who knew every promoter in Rio, he ensured his friends were given the royal treatment in the best nightclubs in towns, as well as introduced to the most attractive girls.\nIt was a clever trick with the aim of building a network of friends that could vouch for Kaiser and help get him short-term deals at a variety of clubs.\n27 Well connected Kaiser claims to have slept with over 1,000 women\nCleverly, he always told his new employers that he lacked match-fitness and would spend the first few weeks training without a ball.\nHowever, it was during his time at Bangu in the 1980s where Kaiser took his life into his hands, perhaps kidding someone he should never have gotten involved with in the first place.\nThe Rio club were owned by Castor de Andrade, one of the most feared gangsters in the whole of Brazil.\nHe operated an illegal gambling underworld and was a notorious criminal. Once during a league match, Castor chased a referee around the pitch because he wasn't happy with the officials' decision.\n27 Castor de Andrade was owner of Bangu, a club based in Rio de Janeiro who Kaiser played for\nThe fact he had a gun on display in his back pocket made his complaints seem even more menacing.\nBut that didn't stop Kaiser for chancing his arm. In a game he was asked to make his debut as a sub, he managed to get sent off before even coming on.\n\"I was injured for 3 months at the beginning. I was faking the injury because at the time there was no Magnetic Resonance technology to check it,\" he revealed.\n\"The doctor had to take my word for it. One day I was partying at a night club here in Rio called Caligula.\nHandout 27 A notorious criminal, de Andrade was king of the gambling underworld\n\"There were no mobile phones then, so the late coach Moises, who played for Vasco, calls me (at the club) and says, 'Boss man wants you on the bench today.'\n\"I was like, 'It\u2019s 4 in the morning. How am I going to play?' Moises replied, 'No, just stay on the bench. You won\u2019t actually play.'\n\"It was a league game against Curitiba. Just as the players are waking up, I\u2019m arriving at the meeting in the hotel.\n\"Then we go to the game. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Bangu is often compared to hell because it\u2019s 40 celsius in the shade. I did not want play in that game.\nSupplied 27 Kaiser revists the Bangu dugout where his secret nearly came out\n\"After five minutes Curitiba are winning 1-0, then 2-0. After eight minutes Castor radios down to Moises telling him to put me on.\n\"And I\u2019m dying. So when I start warming up along the fence, the other fans start calling me f***** and h***.\n\"Then I jump over the fence, start fighting the supporters and get sent off before coming on.\"\nAt the end of the game, Castor made his way into the changing room. Kaiser's teammates were laughing, teasing him that it was the end of his trickery.\nSupplied 27 Flanked by director Louis Myles, left, and producer Dr. Tom Markham, right, Kaiser shows off his Bangu shirt\n\"Castor de Andrade comes into the changing room. When he comes up to me I say, 'God has taken both my parents away, but gave me another father who they accused of being a crook. So I lost it and went for them (the crowd).\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you worry because my contract is up in a week and I\u2019ll be off. Then he called the supervisor and said, 'Double Kaiser\u2019s contract and extend it for 6 months'\"\nKaiser, who had won Castor's trust in their first ever meeting by hiring two escorts to sleep with the mafioso boss, managed to avoid the gangster's wrath.\nAnother string to Kaiser's bow that added to his ruse was how he dealt with journalists.\nSupplied 27 Behind the scenes, Kaiser gets ready to shoot a scene for his documentary\nHe'd happily butter them up, so they could write fake news about him.\nHe explains: \"So when I would come into the training ground I would greet all the journalists. I\u2019d give them team shirts.\n\"I made sure the top players of each club gave interviews when the journalists wanted. So I went for 26 years without being found out.\"\nKaiser, who claims he's slept with over 1,000 women (often pretending to be Brazil's 80s football pin-up Renato Gaucho), divulged why no one wanted to out his secret.\n27 Kaiser managed to pull the wool over a host of clubs' eyes\n\"The players knew, but they were all friends of mine. The journalists... nobody was out to get me.\n\"And there was no MRI. I fooled the doctors. There was a time at the team I was playing in where they really wanted me to play and I had a dentist friend.\n\"The club president approached me and said, 'You never play!' I said, 'I have the note here and they\u2019ve finally discovered what my problem is. It\u2019s a dental issue.' It was pure lies.\n\"And at another club I played for, they brought in a black magic priest to perform rituals on me so my bruise would heal.\nSupplied 27 He had journalists onside too, manipulating them with his cleverly crafted stories\n\"They were paying him nicely, but I went up to him and said, 'Take your money, mate. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me.\n\"Take your money and don\u2019t bother doing your thing because I intend to stay injured for the rest of my life.\"\nSpeaking to SunSport exclusively, 'Kaiser' director Myles revealed how producers Markham and Fullam got him hooked on the project.\n\"Tom asked me for a pint. I was only going to go for one, but Rob, who I\u2019d never met before, was siting there.\n27 Kaiser knew how to sell himself with his limited ability\n\"He proceeded to tell me this crazy story about how a guy had blagged a 26-year career as a footballer, and did all this mad s*** in order to avoid getting caught.\n\"Like everyone who has heard this story, I said 'That\u2019s mad. Someone should make a film about it.'\n\"It took me another couple of pints to realise that\u2019s exactly why they had got me to the boozer in the first place.\"\nRob revealed: \"I first came across Kaiser\u2019s story in an article translated from Portuguese into English on an internet forum.\n27 Carlos Alberto is one of the many contributors to 'Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football'\n\"I read the story in disbelief, not sure if it was true, false or just lost in a dodgy Google translation as the story seemed too good to be true.\n\"I sent it over to a couple of mates, Tom and Stefan, that I was due to meet in the pub that evening.\n\"The lads found the story just as crazy as I did and as we had our first pint we agreed that someone could make a cracking film about it.\n\"A few pints later we\u2019d decided that despite the three of us having no expertise in the film industry we should make the film ourselves.\n27 Bebeto also appears in the brilliant football doc\n\"We sat on the story for over a year, trying to find a way of tracking Kaiser down and finding the director that could steer the project in the right direction.\n\"It wasn\u2019t until myself and Tom were over in Brazil for the 2014 World cup that we started to get some traction.\n\"Kaiser\u2019s story came up in conversation on two separate nights out with Brazilian friends and we realised that Kaiser was part of Rio legend.\n\"We were pointed in the direction of a gym he was now working at in Rio. We arrived to discover he was engaged to two different women at the gym at the same time. This was our first foray into Kaiser\u2019s world.\"\nSupplied 27 Myles admitted a lot of what Kaiser told them couldn't be filmed\nMyles admitted that a lot of what they were told was left on the cutting room floor because it was just too outrageous.\n\"Kaiser had us on the run around. When we first met him, he was a force to be reckoned with,\" he said.\n\"The first two hours were him telling us about all of his accomplishments, both on and off the pitch.\n\"Most of those could never see the light of day in a film as they were so scandalous.\n27 Rio de Janeiro is the beautiful setting for 'Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football'\n\"We went into it knowing that he was a fraudster, so it was on us to try and find out what really happened.\n\"The problem was that Kaiser had an influence over everyone we met. They seemed to come under some sort of spell when it came to gritty details.\n\"But it is understandable that people don't want their bad boy past revealed in their middle ages.\n\"We couldn't find anyone who truly hated him. Zico was affronted by what he did, but not Kaiser himself.\nSupplied 27 Charming Kaiser had an influence over everyone he met\n\"In fact, you couldn't ask for better references. At first, we thought people were lying for him - and I still think that there's a lot of what happened that will never come out.\n\"But you can't fake the laughter and genuine love that these legends had for him. Kaiser came along to the Bebeto interview and Bebeto practically fainted when he saw him, he had tears in his eyes.\"\nAlongside the documentary, the team have also released a book written by esteemed writer Rob Smyth.\nAnd if that's not enough, the film's soundtrack, an excellent reworking of Kaiser Chief's 'I Predict a Riot' by Carolina Lins & Os Planatos, will be released through Tru Thoughts records the same day as the movie.\nSupplied 27 The documentary-makers couldn't find anyone who had a bad word to say about Kaiser\nLouis said: \"We decided to do the book after the second trip to Brazil, when we realised we were sitting on a goldmine of stories.\n\"We also have a song coming out, which is a cover of the Kaiser Chief\u2019s \u201cI Predict a Riot\u201d by Carolina lions and Os Planatas.\n\"That\u2019s one we\u2019re particularly proud of because the idea came whilst having a few Caipirinhas on the Copacabana.\n\"Tom said, 'So the Kaiser starts a riot. He\u2019s called Kaiser. The Kaiser Chiefs would love this!'\nSupplied 27 Kaiser agrees to sign on the dotted line for rights to his film with Markham and Myles\n\"So we found their details, naturally they loved it and let our composers cover it, while letting me tweak the words to fit with Kaiser\u2019s story.\n\"Their one demand was that it had to sound authentic and like they had copied this version.\n\"Carolina Lins & Os Planatos did such a good job that it\u2019s independently picked up a release on it\u2019s own from top indie label Tru Thoughts, who\u2019ve an amazing back catalogue.\n\"We\u2019re glad that the film can finally be seen. There\u2019s been so much interest in the story, but it still doesn\u2019t necessarily convert into getting the film out there.\n27 Carlos Kaiser spent more time in nightclubs with his pal Renato Gaucho than on the pitch\n27 Kaiser's long-flowing locks made him look more like a rock star than a footballer\n27 The fake footballer's life is as colourful as his personality\n27 He was even close to Brazilian legend Zico, who loved him\n\"Documentaries are a bit different to drama films in that they gain word of mouth and actually get seen more after a cinema run \u2013 so we\u2019re looking forward to the digital and DVD release.\n\"We hope people enjoy the film, and that people buy into and enjoy the madcap world that was 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s Brazil. It would be pretty hard not to \u2013 great music, not many clothes and brilliant football.\"\n'Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never To Play Football' is out in cinemas through Kaleidoscope Entertainment from July 26.\nFor details on getting tickets, visit their website.\nThe book of the same name is out through Yellow Jersey on the same day as its theatrical release.\nWhile, Carolina Lins & Os Planatos' cover of 'I Predict A Riot' is released July 26.\n}}
{{Posted Monday, November 5, 2018 3:18 pm\nWilson County Schools announced Monday afternoon that the football season is over for varsity teams from Fike and Hunt after a postgame altercation between players from both teams at Hunt on Nov. 1.\nThe statement from WCS public relations director Amber Lynch read: \u201cWilson County Schools has completed its investigation of the fight between several players on the Fike and Hunt HS football teams that occurred after the game on Nov. 1. School and district officials have made a unified decision that the football season is over for both teams. Each team still had one more game to play in the regular season and were both in contention for the playoffs. The students involved in the fight will also face disciplinary action.\u201d\nThe fight came after Fike\u2019s 28-0 victory when players were shaking hands on the field. Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s deputies used pepper spray to break up the fight.\nMonday's statement was a joint effort by WCS superintendent Lane Mills, WCS athletic director Jimmy Tillman, Hunt principal Eddie Doll, Fike principal Randy St. Clair, Hunt athletic director Jon Smith, Fike athletic director and football head coach Tom Nelson and Hunt football head coach Keith Byrum.\n\u201cParticipation in athletics is a privilege and not a right. Rivalries and traditions are important, but lack of sportsmanship from our athletes will not be tolerated. While we did notify the North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) about the incident, we felt strongly enough about the expectation of sportsmanship that we did not submit information about the incident to the NCHSAA for review. We made our own decision following protocol set forth by NCHSAA to end the regular season and self impose the ban on the playoffs. Both teams will also be fined up to $1,000.\u201d\nHunt was to have played at Havelock on Friday in a game that was postponed due to Hurricane Florence. That game will now be a forfeit loss for the Warriors, who will finish 4-7. Fike, which finishes 4-6, did not have a game scheduled this week.

{{STANFORD, CA \u2013 Aug. 11 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) \u2014 The Southern Bleacher Company, based in Graham, TX, has constructed, in part, a brand new football stadium for the University of Stanford in California that is scheduled to open in September of 2006. In June of 2005, Stanford University\u2019s Board of Trustees gave preliminary approval for a major re-building of Stanford Stadium; the 85,500-seat facility has been the home of Stanford Football since 1921.\nThe trustees approved a concept plan presented by the Department of Athletics that will modernize almost all facilities within the stadium, and reduce the stadium\u2019s capacity to 50,000 seats for the purpose of bringing spectators closer to the field.\nThe stadium was demolished following the Stanford versus Notre Dame Game on Thanksgiving weekend of 2005. Fans across the country who were viewing the football game were able to observe the demolition equipment in the area that surrounded the old stadium and was immediately put into effect after the game.\nThe grand opening is scheduled for September 16, 2006, where Stanford players plan to kick off with their Navy opponents. Southern Bleacher executives will be in attendance on opening day in Palo Alto, CA.\n\u201cSouthern Bleacher was pleased to work with Vance Brown, General Contractor for the project,\u201d Garrett Pettus, Marketing, Southern Bleacher, said. \u201cIn addition, our sales representative, David McClendon, Mechanical Engineer and Texas-Tech University graduate, was an integral part of the project and has been with Southern Bleacher since 1988.\u201d\nBuilding plans include a number of changes such as more comfortable seating; improved sightlines; improved egress and ingress for circulation; renovated and increased number of restrooms; locker rooms and concession stands; a distributed sound system; additional matrix video board; a new Skybox; improved ADA accessibility; and seismic retrofitting.\nThe re-building of Stanford Stadium cost approximately $90 million. The project was funded by the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER) Investment Fund, and from friends of Stanford University who are passionate about the program and understand the vision for the stadium.\nAs a result, the new stadium was completed without incurring any long-term debt and will mark the beginning of a new era for Stanford football. With support from fans, the University, and the Department of Athletics, the Cardinal football team is poised to regain its national prominence.\n\u201cThe new stadium will retain the earthy exterior and extensive landscaping of the historic stadium,\u201d Pettus said. \u201cThe insertion of new stadium elements within the confines of the existing landscape will result in a modernized facility that will reside within the historic stadium\u2019s \u2018footprint.'\u201d\nSince 1946, Southern Bleacher has set the standard of excellence in the design and manufacturing of sports stadiums and entertainment venues; they are the nation\u2019s largest stadium manufacturer.\nSouthern Bleacher\u2019s comprehensive services include budget analysis, estimates, proposal drawings and specifications at no cost.

{{Flocks of students walked from class to class on Tuesday with a sense of familiarity, just one month removed from their first-semester course loads. But for a few, the beginning of the second semester is a transition to a new home. And for three Boston College football mid-year enrollees, it also marks the start of a collegiate athletic career.\nFreshmen Travis Levy, Alec Lindstrom, and E.J. Perry have decided to enroll mid-year. The three graduated from high school this winter, and will begin practicing with the Eagles this spring.\nLevy will join Jonathan Hilliman and Davon Jones in the backfield. The Sherwood High School alumnus\u2019 numbers speak for themselves. As a four-year starter, Levy surpassed 5,000 yards from scrimmage and tallied 76 total touchdowns in his career. In his senior season, the 5-foot-11 workhorse ran for 1,809 yards and 29 touchdowns, en route to earning Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year honors. There will be carries to go around, as the Eagles are losing running backs Tyler Rouse and Myles Willis to graduation.\nSomeday, Levy may find himself running behind a blocking Lindstrom. Alec will join his brother Chris, a starter in each of his first two years at BC, on the offensive line. As an upperclassman at Shepherd Hill Regional High School, Alec had a hand in his team\u2019s dominant rushing attack. In his senior campaign, ball carriers averaged 7.6 yards per rush and eclipsed 3,300 yards on the ground.\nAfter leading the Eagles to their first bowl victory in nine years, graduate student Patrick Towles\u2014last year\u2019s starting quarterback\u2014has run out of eligibility. Perry will accompany Darius Wade, John Fadule, and Anthony Brown on the depth chart. As a senior at Andover High School, Perry tossed 47 touchdowns, tying the Massachusetts state record\u2014one that he shares with none other than BC legend Doug Flutie. Like the 1980s Eagle phenom, Perry is a dual-threat. In addition to throwing for 3,398 yards, he scampered for over 1,000 yards during his senior year.\nOn Feb. 1, BCEagles.com will broadcast a National Signing Day Show, revealing the rest of the Eagles\u2019 2017 recruiting class.\nOut with the old, in with the new. Like all college sports teams, BC football\u2019s identity is ever-changing. The addition of Levy, Lindstrom, and Perry is just the start.\nCorrection: An early version of this article stated that Levy, Lindstrom, and Perry are grayshirting. They are mid-year enrollees only, not grayshirts.\nFeatured Image by Savanna Kiefer / Heights Editor\n}}

{{Article continues below ...\nNow that we\u2019re into Week 9 of the Big 12 Football calendar, it\u2019s time for another round of conference power rankings.\nOklahoma and Oklahoma State are the top two teams in the Big 12, and they\u2019re both sitting at two losses on the season now. With West Virginia and Baylor each suffering losses, the Big 12 championship is very much a four-way race right now. On the other hand, with backloaded scheduling to finish the season out, you have to wonder at this point if any team will be able to win out and position itself into playoff discussion, or contention.\nEven for middle-tier teams, there are significant bowl implications on the line, as some might not be eligible as the season progresses. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see, but with how last weekend went down, It\u2019s safe to say we can expect some serious drama heading into bowl season.\nDisclaimer:\nThe following power rankings are based on observations for weeks 1-8, while forecasting playoff implications; there are no additional factors, so expect these rankings to change a lot this season based off how powerfully these teams are performing.\nFor those keeping track, here are my Big 12 Power Rankings for Week 8.\n10. Kansas Jayhawks (Record: 1-7)\nThe Kansas Jayhawks truly appear to be on their own island in the Big 12 right now, which isn\u2019t a good thing. With eight games into the schedule, we all would have liked to have seen something\u2013anything really\u2013to indicate the team is on the right path towards a turnaround. But so far, the Jayhawks\u2019 shortcomings paint a picture that improvements are tangible, just not likely within the next few years.\nIn the Jayhawks\u2019 56-3 loss against Oklahoma, the Sooners needed to pile on points to demonstrate its offensive firepower, but also make a statement on defense, as it fell significantly in both total defense and passing defense against Texas Tech two weeks ago. With a dominant win over Kansas, the Sooners were able to do just that, and then some. Kansas crossed the 50-yard line on just three drives, and were only able to amass 170 total yards of offense, despite holding on to the football for 29 minutes and 55 seconds.\nQuarterback Montell Cozart threw two interceptions, and the Kansas offense was only able to put up 49 yards rushing on the day. Averaging less than four yards-per-play is no way to win in any league, even one where defense doesn\u2019t usually dominate.\nKansas goes on the road to Morgantown this weekend, and coming off a potential playoff-ending loss for West Virginia, expect no mercy; this could get very ugly, very fast, as the Mountaineers will need to dominate the rest of the season.\nNext Game:\nWest Virginia vs. Kansas Morgantown, W. Va. ESPN2\n9. Iowa State Cyclones (Record: 1-7)\nIowa State held Kansas State quarterback Jesse Ertz to just 151 yards last weekend, and shut the Wildcats out of scoring several times. That alone is a serious improvement for a team that doesn\u2019t have much to show on the season\u2013at least at face value.\nIowa State has dropped nine straight to Bill Snyder\u2019s Wildcats, but managed to do enough to make this meeting pretty interesting. Despite just scoring three points in the first half, the Cyclones managed to put up 493 total yards of offense, but redzone efficiency was a huge issue. Jacob Park set the Cyclones up on the Kansas State 1 yard line on a 10 yard catch. The Wildcats rank No. 32 in total defense, but first and goal from the one is manageable. Unfortunately, a run/run/run/pass combination of calls led to a turnover on downs in a situation where Iowa State couldn\u2019t even afford to settle for a field goal.\nWith Oklahoma visiting Ames this weekend, it\u2019s hard to see a situation where the Cyclones keep it close, but if it can capitalize off the Sooners\u2019 defensive inconsistencies, it might not be a shutout, as was the case for the Kansas Jayhawks last weekend.\nNext Game:\nIowa State vs. Oklahoma Ames, Iowa 6:30 p.m. ESPN\n8. TCU Horned Frogs (Record: 4-2)\nTCU head coach Gary Patterson is easily one of the most likable coaches in the Big 12, primarily for his demeanor. So for coach Patterson to pull transfer quarterback Kenny Hill after completing 15/29 for 160 yards and one interception for Foster Sawyer, it showed the Texas Tech defense that TCU had limited faith in its offense, and David Gibbs was able to capitalize.\nKicker Brandon Hatfield was perfect on PAT\u2019s, but struggled on field goals, where he made just 1/4 attempts, including a field goal attempt in double overtime. Texas Tech kicker Clayton Hatfield would go on to kick the game winning field goal to end it on the ensuing possession.\nThe biggest red flag for TCU wasn\u2019t the kicking situation, however, it was in scoring efficiency. TCU ranks No. 73 in the nation in redzone scoring, making 41 trips inside the 20 for a .829 scoring percentage. On Saturday afternoon, the Horned Frogs came up empty on three trips in scoring territory, including three missed field goals from 37, 15, and 39 yards out, and one interception at the Texas Tech 39 yard line.\nWith TCU and Baylor coming off brutal losses and bowl eligibility implications on the line for the Horned Frogs, Saturday\u2019s game will be something to pay attention to.\nNext Game:\nBaylor vs. TCU Waco, Texas FOX\n7. Texas Tech Red Raiders (Record: 4-4)\nIf you told a Texas Tech fan that head coach Kliff Kingsbury would commit less to the Air Raid following the 48-17 loss against West Virginia in favor of an evenly distributed pass/run scheme against TCU, they probably would have laughed at you. I probably would have laughed at you considering how stubborn Kingsbury has been with his offense. Well, that was the case, and the defense appeared to finally be clicking in the Red Raiders\u2019 thrilling 27-24 double overtime victory in Fort Worth.\nFollowing the record performance by Patrick Mahomes against Oklahoma, the quarterback was 24/39 for 206 yards, with three touchdowns, and one interception. Tied 10-10 at halftime, the Red Raiders came back and shut TCU out in the third quarter. Tech\u2019s defense also gave TCU issues in the redzone, preventing scores on two trips inside the 20. Tied at the end of regulation, both sides of the football were showing the resilience and confidence it\u2019s been lacking throughout the past few years.\nAs is the case in all games, I read an asinine comment attributing Texas Tech\u2019s victory on account of TCU kicker Brandon Hatfield, who was just 1/4 on field goals on the day. To give credit where it\u2019s due, despite allowing 418 yards, Tech\u2019s defense was the reason the Red Raiders won. This is huge for a team that gave up 82 points to TCU two years ago.\nPerhaps the biggest stats of the night came off Texas Tech ending its three game turnover drought by Douglas Coleman. And the 122nd most penalized team in the nation showed significant improvement on disciple, committing just one penalty for just five yards.\nD\u2019Onta Foreman should be in Heisman discussion, so how Texas Tech\u2019s defense protects the Texas Longhorns\u2019 run game this weekend will probably emerge as the biggest storyline\u2013win or lose.\nNext Game:\nTexas Tech vs. Texas Lubbock, Texas FS1\n6. Texas Longhorns (Record: 4-4)\nDown. Goes. Baylor.\nThe Texas Longhorns were underdogs headed into Saturday\u2019s matchup against the undefeated Baylor Bears, however, as we all know, upsets in college football are guaranteed at some point or another.\nFacing extreme scrutiny, and with job security red hot, Charlie Strong had to find a way to win, and he delivered. The first drive by Baylor resulted in a 50 yard touchdown run by Bears\u2019 quarterback Seth Russell. Many thought that if Texas couldn\u2019t contain Russell, it could be a very long day. However, Texas brought pressure, and even limited Baylor to a single field goal in the fourth quarter. The Longhorns\u2019 biggest accomplishment in the fourth quarter was taking 2 minutes and 24 seconds off the clock on a touchdown drive, leaving just :46 seconds for Baylor to score. With an aggressive pass rush, including a sack for loss by Malik Jefferson, capped by an incomplete pass to KD Cannon as time expired, the Longhorns prevailed to win, 35-34.\nTexas\u2019s defense will have to contain Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes this weekend in a similar way that TCU did. But for a defense that\u2019s ranked No. 111 in the nation in total defense, allowing 461.9 yards-per-game, compared to the nation\u2019s second highest rated offense in Texas Tech, that might be easier said than done.\nNext Game:\nTexas Tech vs. Texas Lubbock, Texas 11:00 a.m. FS1\n5. Kansas State Wildcats (Record: 5-3)\nHaving won four of its last five games, the Kansas State Wildcats\u2019 31-26 win over the Iowa State Cyclones certainly pulls them within bowl reach. Although, the win is certainly nothing to write home about, especially considering Kansas State\u2019s backloaded schedule to finish the season.\nQuarterback Jesse Ertz completed 18 of 28 passes for just 151 yards and a touchdown, but Kansas State was shutout in the fourth quarter completely. Defensively, the numbers are even more worrisome, considering the scheduling to finish out the regular season. Kansas State allowed 493 total yards against a 1-7 (0-5 in Big 12 play) Iowa State team, which included two, fourth quarter touchdowns.\nI imagine phrases such as \u201cKansas State held off Iowa State\u201d is leaving Wildcats\u2019 fans with a very uneasy feeling. Still, with No. 22 Oklahoma State visiting Manhattan this weekend, followed by games at Baylor, and TCU to wrap the season, Kansas State has to find ways to create more separation.\nNext Game:\nKansas State vs. Oklahoma State Manhattan, Kan. 2:30 p.m. ABC / ESPN2\n4. Baylor Bears (Record: 6-1)\nWhether people wanted to accept it or not, when a team is thin on depth, rotating in fresh bodies can be a challenge, and it was only a matter of time before Baylor\u2019s depth chart starting showing fatigue. Against a Texas Longhorns\u2019 team that has shown a refusal to quit over and over this season, Baylor had to know this wouldn\u2019t be an easy game.\nSeth Russell threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns in the Bears\u2019 second straight loss to the Longhorns. But its 624 yards of total offense were the most its ever put up on Texas. Unfortunately for Baylor, Texas might have knocked the Big 12 out of playoff contention along with Oklahoma State, which also handed West Virginia its first loss of the season.\nWhen addressing the media on Monday, Baylor head coach Jim Grobe said quarterback Seth Russell was in concussion protocol, but wouldn\u2019t provide any further information, such as a timetable.\nNext Game:\nBaylor vs. TCU Waco, Texas FOX\n3. West Virginia Mountaineers (Record: 6-1)\nWest Virginia was setting itself up to be the conference darling, and unsung hero of underdogs everywhere. With dominant performances against Texas Tech and TCU, the Mountaineers appeared balanced and well coached. There\u2019s definitive proof those factors are true, but when a team is undefeated, it\u2019s also extremely likely that there will be a loss somewhere on the schedule.\nEnter: Oklahoma State.\nThe Cowboys capitalized off three turnovers by West Virginia, and were able to put 17 points on the board as a result. When you\u2019re sitting in the drivers\u2019 seat of your conference standings, fundamental errors can cost dearly. So when you\u2019re putting the football in the opposing teams\u2019 hands, there\u2019s a high probability bad things will happen. Moving forward, ball security clearly must be addressed.\nWith the 1-7 Kansas Jayhawks up this weekend, West Virginia should use the game as an opportunity to introduce some exotic plays, tune up the defense, and work on fundamentals. With a trip to Austin in two weeks to take on the wildly unpredictable Longhorns, West Virginia is going to have to be dialed in.\nNext Game:\nWest Virginia vs. Kansas Morgantown, W. Va. 6:00 p.m. ESPN2\n2. Oklahoma State Cowboys (Record: 6-2)\nThe Oklahoma State Cowboys successfully handed the Big 12 conference its first upset of the day on Saturday with a 37-20 victory over the No. 10 ranked West Virginia Mountaineers. With a 33-26 overtime victory last year against the Mountaineers, the Cowboys probably felt pretty confident coming into the game, despite having lost two games this season.\nWhile the Mountaineers have surpassed all expectations and emerged as the Big 12\u2019s dark horse, it was only a matter of time before a team caught on to their game plan. West Virginia ranks No. 24 in the nation in passing yards at 2,033, but the Cowboys held quarterback Skyler Howard to just 212 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. Taking advantage of a likely tired unit that has been stout, the Cowboys were able to rack up 358 yards of offense, with Mason Rudolph accounting for 273 total yards, and three touchdowns.\nHosting Kansas State this weekend should be fun, as both teams have been establishing defensive fortitude, and balanced offensive attacks this season.\nNext Game:\nKansas State vs. Oklahoma State Manhattan, Kan. 2:30 p.m. ABC / ESPN2\n1. Oklahoma Sooners (Record: 6-2)\nDon\u2019t shoot the opinionated messenger here, but unlike a few Big 12 pundits, the hangover from the shootout between the Sooners and Texas Tech Red Raiders is still lingering, and therefore, I\u2019m still not 100 percent sold on the Sooners ranking No.1. With a 56-3 blowout win over the Kansas Jayhawks last weekend, experts are saying the Sooners are back into playoff conversation, but 1) It\u2019s Kansas, and 2) Defense was still an issue against Texas Tech.\nSooners\u2019 quarterback Baker Mayfield did \u201cBaker Mayfield\u201d things, completing 16 of 24 passes for 236 yards\u2026 but it was against a Kansas defense that allowed 538 yards.\nThe win over Kansas became the 12th straight game the Sooners had over 500 yards of offense against Big 12 opponents, making it the longest streak in Big 12 history. Iowa State this weekend should be an easy win, but with Baylor, West Virginia, and Oklahoma State to finish the season, we might have to wait a few more weeks to truly test how good this Sooners\u2019 team really is.\nNext Game:\nIowa State vs. Oklahoma Ames, Iowa 6:30 p.m. ESPN\nThis article originally appeared on\n}}
{{Miles.Sanders.jpg\nImpact player and Penn State pledge Miles Sanders of Woodland Hills tops our list of Pennsylvania's top 2016 football recruits.\n(PennLive, file)\nHeading into the Spring season, Penn State coach James Franklin's first Class of '16 verbal commitment represents our top-ranked junior in Woodland Hills standout Miles Sanders.\nWhile Franklin welcomed a couple of marquee running backs in Bishop McDevitt's Andre Robinson and Whitehall's Saquon Barkley on signing day recently, you can never pack away too many impact players in the offensive backfield.\n1. THE SANDERS FILE\nSchool: Woodland Hills\nHeight: 6-0\nWeight: 195\nStar ratings: 4 stars by Scout, 247Sports and Rivals\nQuick hits: Sanders has been a cornerstone for George Novak's Wolverines since his freshman season, chalking up nearly 1,850 yards as an underclassmen before adding 1,132 yards and 18 touchdowns on just 97 carries last season. His strength, vision and 4.4 speed are key ingredients to Sanders' high average. Committed to Penn State last July over Pittsburgh, Michigan, Michigan State and Virginia Tech. Ranked No. 1 in the state by Rivals, No. 3 nationally at his position and 53rd overall.\nFILM STUDY\nIt's difficult to critique a running back who simply looks the part, then backs it up with such game-changing speed and presence. For our purposes then, it seems appropriate to simply select some of our favorite clips from the Penn State pledge.\nSanders' first act showcases a knee-buckling spin move, but it's mainly that inside-out ability that had us rewinding the film.\nAt 1:58, Sanders rips through the middle and makes a serious full-speed cut to open a long lane to the end zone.\nYou see it again at 5:27 as Sanders burns through the A-gap, bounces off a pair of tacklers, and whips to the outside.\nIn between is a series of carnival (2:44) rides - check out the ridiculous punt return at 4:35 - and Sanders' serious appetite for finding the end zone.\nWe know Penn State should be well-equipped at the running back position once Sanders hits campus, but you can't deny his versatility and home-run skill set. That combination usually gets you on the field sooner rather than later.\n}}
{{HASTINGS, Nebraska -- Entering the 2010 high school football season, the McCook Bison coaching staff listed the offensive line as one of the strengths of the team.\nThe huge Bison front line keyed a 15-14 comeback victory at Adams Central Friday night that kept McCook's Class B-7 District title hopes alive.\nThe contest was played at Patriots Field on the Adams Central campus just west of Hastings.\nThe Bison showed they could handle adversity just fine. Junior starting quarterback Matt Chitwood went out of the game in the first quarter with an injury, and he did not return. Senior Brad Baumbach came off the bench to lead the McCook rally as the offense scored a pair of third-quarter touchdowns.\nThe Bison trailed 7-3 at halftime. Then Adams Central sophomore Jake Fowler shocked McCook when he returned the second-half kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown to boost the Patriots to a 14-3 cushion.\nBig third-quarter possessions\nHead coach Jeff Gross then called on his O-line, anchored by seniors Derek Chancellor, Chris Conroy, Greg Stafford and Ben Vetrovsky, to lead a charge through the Adams Central defense. The Bison put together a pair of third-quarter drives that resulted in a pair of touchdowns and put McCook ahead by a single point late in the period.\nFollowing Adams Central's touchdown return, McCook drove 77 yards in 11 plays and overcame two major penalties during the possession to score midway through the third quarter. Sophomore Jake Schlager scored on a 5-yard yard as the sophomore set up in the Wildcat formation where center Stafford snapped the ball directly back to Schlager in shotgun formation.\nThe Patriots stopped fullback Justin Terry just short of the goal line on the two-point conversion try. McCook trailed 14-9 with seven minutes left in the third period.\nThe Bison gave the hosts a first down on the next possession via a horse-collar tackle infraction. But McCook's defense dug in and forced a punt near midfield, and the Bison took over at their 32-yard line.\nSenior wide receiver Cody Goltl alertly pounced on a McCook fumble on the first play of the drive after senior running back Branden Yost had run 10 yards before losing control of the football. Seven plays later, the Bison went ahead on a 4-yard option run by senior quarterback Brad Baumbach.\nYost was stopped short on the conversion run, and McCook led 15-14 with 1:22 remaining in the third period.\nTwo big defensive plays\nThe Bison defense took over in the final quarter. Senior Ryan Powell came up with the first play of the game with Adams Central moving the ball deep in McCook territory. On fourth down and 6 from the Bison 23, Patriots quarterback Matt Overmiller fired a pass of 6-3 wide receiver Nick Stine in the left flat. The 5-8 Powell came up from his cornerback position and made a sure tackle, stopping Stine two yards short of a first down and giving the ball back to the Bison.\nMcCook moved the ball near midfield before the Adams Central defense forced a punt. The Patriots took over at their 14-yard line with 4:29 remaining.\nThe hosts pulled off a fourth-down fake punt with a pass from Stine to tight end Calvin Ott, who outjumped McCook linebacker Keith Wallace to control the ball for a 20-yard gain and keep the home team's hopes alive.\nThree plays later, quarterback Overmiller scrambled for a 7-yard gain, but the Bison were whistled for a face mask penalty that helped move the ball into Bison territory. On the next play, Adams Central tried a reverse pass, with the ball flipped back to Overmiller, who tried to throw a long pass downfield. But Goltl snagged the interception in front of the Patriots receiver and returned the ball upfield.\nMcCook drew an illegal block penalty on Goltl's interception return, but the Bison owned possession of the football on their 23-yard line with about two minutes left.\nAfter an Adams Central timeout on first down, Baumbach scrambled 9 yards for a first down, then Adams Central used its final timeout as Baumbach kneeled down behind his line on the next play. Baumbach took a knee twice more to run out the clock on a huge Bison win.\nFirst-half scoring\nAfter forcing a McCook punt on the opening possession of the game, Adams Central drove 54 yards in 11 plays for its only offensive touchdown of the contest. Ryan Bender capped the march with a 2-yard touchdown with 6:31 left in the opening period.\nMcCook drove to the Adams Central 4-yard line early in the second quarter, but a Baumbach pass was intercepted by Kyle Cuddeford near the goal line. The Patriots drew a holding penalty and could not escape the shadow of the goal line as the Bison forced a punt from the Patriots 7. A short kick gave McCook possession at the AC 34-yard line, but the Bison managed just one first down before settling for a 36-yard field goal by Justin Terry to go into intermission trailing 7-3.\nHoldrege at Weiland Field Oct. 22\nMcCook improved to 7-1 on the season, while Adams Central slipped to 5-3. The Bison should have guaranteed themselves a spot in the Class B state playoffs with the victory, but McCook can win the B-7 District title in the regular-season finale against Holdrege Friday, Oct. 22 at Weiland Field.\nAdams Central travels to Lexington next Friday.\n}}
{{MOSCOW \u2014 Russian soccer fans may need government-issued ID cards next season to buy tickets for league games.\nModeled on the \u201cFan ID\u201d scheme used at last year\u2019s World Cup, a senior sports ministry official said Tuesday that from July 1 fans would need to pass a security check before being allowed to buy tickets. However, the ministry later said the plan wasn\u2019t yet confirmed.\nIn comments reported by the Tass state news agency, ministry official Irina Grigoryeva said she hopes \u201cthese measures will allow us to increase public safety and public order (at games).\u201d\nSimilar systems in countries like Italy, which introduced an ID system for away fans in league games in 2009 to combat hooliganism, have been blamed for driving away spectators. However, Grigoryeva said the new system in Russia would likely attract more fans \u201cwho previously avoided these events because of potential risks.\u201d\nThe sports ministry later distanced itself from Grigoryeva\u2019s comments. Minister Pavel Kolobkov said in a statement \u201cit is too early to say whether this system will be adopted, in what form and if so, when.\u201d\nWithout the ID system, average attendances since the World Cup have risen 21 per cent to 16,898 in the Russian league this season. It could prove difficult to install advanced security systems at some of the country\u2019s older sports arenas within the next four months, alongside existing plans to add video review technology for next season.\nWhile Russian hooligans caused havoc at the 2016 European Championship, fights at Russian league games have been rare in recent years, though racist abuse remains a problem.\nThe World Cup ID system kept out some convicted hooligans but was criticized by some Russian fans for being opaque and unaccountable. Violence at the tournament was rare.\nHowever, fan representatives said thousands had been refused IDs for the World Cup with little explanation and no way to appeal in time for the tournament. The number of those refused was far larger than Russia\u2019s official database of hooligans banned from games, and some fans said they had been barred for decades-old convictions for minor offences such as jaywalking.\nThe World Cup IDs doubled as Russian visas and allowed fans free travel on many buses and trains. There was no word on whether Russian fans would get similar benefits in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP\u2013Sports\n}}
{{After taking a day off from practice Tuesday, UCLA returned to the field Wednesday for its first day in full pads. Here are notes and observations from the open period of practice:\nInjury notes\nSame players in yellow non-contact jerseys: Otito Ogbonnia, Atonio Mafi and Audie Omotosho\nPersonnel notes\nColin Samuel was not seen at practice. The cornerback suffered what appeared to be a right leg injury during warm-ups Monday and needed assistance getting off the field.\nReceiver Damian Alloway was also not seen at practice.\nNotes and observations\nThe field goal period included (I think) 18 kicks in about four minutes. J.J. Molson, kicking from 42 yards, was 6 for 9. Andrew Strauch was 2 for 3 from about 27 yards. Quentin Wallace was 3 for 4 from 27 yards and Crawford Pierson was 2 for 2 from 27.\nPhysically, Justin Murphy looks as impressive as any offensive lineman on the team. He\u2019s listed at 6-foot-6, but seems to tower over most of his teammates and looks incredibly fit.

{{Getty Images\nCommon sense seemed poised to fly out the window this week in Philadelphia and Baltimore, where each team has a key player who suffered an Achilles tendon injury on his own time during the offseason. The fact that the Eagles and Ravens can refuse to pay left tackle Jason Peters and linebacker Terrell Suggs, respectively, has morphed into a growing belief that one or both will.\nIn Philly, the indications have culminated in a report that the Eagles will at least reduce Peters\u2019 pay by what they are paying Demetress Bell, the man who was signed to replace Peters on the roster. In Baltimore, however, there has been no serious suggestion that the Ravens will say \u201cpsych!\u201d to Suggs when the time comes to get paid.\nJeff Zrebiec of the Baltimore Sun reports that, indeed, there currently are no indications that the Ravens will keep all or part of Suggs\u2019 $4.9 million base salary. Zrebiec also reports that there have been no internal discussions regarding the possibility of not paying the 2011 defensive player of the year.\nAs we\u2019ve said before and will say again (including right now), it would be asinine to punish Suggs (or Peters, for that matter) for getting injured while trying to get/stay in shape. Absent evidence they suffered the injuries doing something reckless or risky, any injury sustained during any type of normal exercise (including basketball) should result in no consequence to Suggs or Peters or any other player.\nThe Ravens have done nothing in recent years to suggest that they are stupid. And unless they know something the rest of us don\u2019t about how Suggs was injured, it would be stupid to not pay him.\n}}

{{DraftKings came out swinging against allegations that an employee had made as much as $350,000 by cheating on fantasy football gambling.\nThe daily fantasy sports industry is facing controversy over allegations that employees at DraftKings and FanDuel are using privileged company data to win big on rival sites \u2014 a cheating tactic analogous to insider trading on Wall Street.\nFans first grew suspicious when a DraftKings employee inadvertently leaked a list of the most popular players drafted by customers in a link tweeted from the company's account hours before it was supposed to hit the site.\nSee also: How DraftKings came out of nowhere to own football advertising\nAs it turns out, the same employee who apologized for the mistake, DraftKings content manager Ethan Haskell, also appears to have won $350,000 on FanDuel in the same week.\nFanDuel spokesperson Justine Sacco: 0.3% of total $ won on its site has been won by DraftKings employees. Believe that would be < than $10M \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 6, 2015\nThe fact that Haskell had access to proprietary data raised questions about the fairness of employees winning jackpots at competing sites, as well as the general lack of regulation in a burgeoning multibillion industry that critics have labelled legalized gambling.\nLate Monday, DraftKings said that an internal investigation showed Haskell didn't receive the data until 40 minutes after FanDuel's deadline to set rosters, which would mean he couldn't have used it to pick players on the site.\n\"For the last several days, DraftKings has been conducting a thorough investigation, including examining records of internal communications and access to our database, interviewing our employees, and sharing information regarding the incident with FanDuel,\" a spokesperson said in an email (see full statement below).\nThe attention was nonetheless enough to compel the two startups to release a joint statement earlier on Monday asserting that \"nothing is more important\" than \"the integrity of the games.\"\n\"Both companies have strong policies in place to ensure that employees do not misuse any information at their disposal and strictly limit access to company data to only those employees who require it to do their jobs,\" the statement reads.\n\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams, and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it.\"\nThe complicated relationships of fantasy sports\nWith the new, sharper statements DraftKings took a stronger stance in denying than it did in an initial New York Times report on Monday, which said \"a spokesman for DraftKings acknowledged that employees of both companies had won big jackpots playing at other daily fantasy sites.\"\nBoth companies acknowledged that some employees play on competing sites, but reiterated that there was no evidence that anyone had misused company data.\nThe Fantasy Sports Trade Association, along with the two companies, said in a separate statement Monday night that it has updated its member charter to explicitly ban access of company data to employees while playing on competing sites.\nThe daily fantasy format \u2014 in which fans pick players for a single game day and bet for pools of prize money rather than drafting a season-long team among groups of friends \u2014 was made popular by the two companies and has roped in hundreds of new converts, thanks to advertising blitzes that have made the two brands ubiquitous on football broadcasts and across the Internet.\nBut research done by Sports Business Daily shows that just 1.3% of players took home about 90% of the winnings in the first half of the fantasy baseball season.\nMost internet gambling was made illegal by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006, but fantasy sports managed to carve out an exemption thanks to heavy lobbying from pro sports leagues.\nFootball is a big business, both on the field and on computers. Image: IFAF American Football Men's World Championship\nThe low overhead costs and a 10% cut of each \"entry fee\" make it a lucrative business model that has pulled in hundreds of millions in venture capital funding. Each company is valued at more than $1 billion.\n\"It's as attractive as almost any industry you can think of \u2014 it's a casino where you don't have to build a casino,\" Nomura analyst Kevin Rippey told Mashable in a previous interview.\nBut the industry's place at the thin line between legal and illegal Internet gambling has invited plenty of scrutiny from regulators and politicians. Accusations like these are sure to increase the demand for more of a regulatory structure.\nYou can read DraftKings' full statement from Monday night here:\n\u201cThere has been some confusion regarding a recent piece of data that was inadvertently posted on DraftKings' blog containing information about players and fantasy games. Some reports are mischaracterizing the situation and implying that there was wrongdoing. We want to set the record straight. For the last several days, DraftKings has been conducting a thorough investigation, including examining records of internal communications and access to our database, interviewing our employees, and sharing information regarding the incident with FanDuel. The evidence clearly shows that the employee in question did not receive the data on player utilization until 1:40 p.m. ET on Sunday, September 27. Lineups on FanDuel locked at 1:00 p.m. that day, at which point this employee (along with every other person playing in a FanDuel contest) could no longer edit his player selections. This clearly demonstrates that this employee could not possibly have used the information in question to make decisions about his FanDuel lineup. Again, there is no evidence that any information was used to create an unfair advantage, and any insinuations to the contrary are factually incorrect.\u201d\nUpdate, Tuesday October 6 12 p.m. PST: ESPN's Outside the Lines reported on Tuesday that ESPN has dropped DraftKings and FanDuel sponsored elements from its shows in response to the controversy. The channel will continue to air both companies' ads.\nIn July, DraftKings struck a deal with ESPN parent company Disney in which DraftKings promised $250 million in ad spending over the course of two years and ESPN gave the company exclusive advertising rights on the channel beginning in 2016.\nThe agreement came after a bigger deal that would've given Disney a stake in the startup fell through. At the time, Recode reported from anonymous sources that Disney executives had qualms about tying the family-friendly brand to such a controversial business.\n}}

But tax authorities later found that some of the information presented in that settlement was incorrect, the prosecutors said.\nHe is the latest high-profile figure from football to be subjected to an investigation by the Spanish tax office, following the likes of Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Radamel Falcao, Javier Mascherano and Angel di Maria.\nRonaldo was last week accused of evading \u20ac14.7 million through offshore companies and will appear before a judge on July 31, judicial sources told AFP.\nACCUSED OF EVADING TAXES IN SPAIN\nCRISTIANO RONALDO\n\u20ac14.7m LIONEL MESSI\n\u20ac4.1m JOSE MOURINHO\n\u20ac3.3m\n\u20ac1 = S$1.55\nHe and Mourinho are both clients of football super-agent Jorge Mendes, who has also been summoned to appear before the court at Pozuelo de Alarcon on June 27.\nRonaldo - on duty for Portugal at the Confederations Cup in Russia which ends on July 2 - is facing four charges of fraud through offshore companies between 2011 and 2014.\nThe hearing will also take place at Pozuelo de Alarcon, in the suburbs of Madrid, according to Spanish press reports.\nProsecutors accuse the 32-year-old of evading tax via a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands and another in Ireland, known for its low corporate tax rate.\nIn addition, they say he only declared \u20ac11.5 million of Spanish-related income from 2011 to 2014, while what he really earned during that time was close to \u20ac43 million.\nSTAYING PUT Ronaldo is a Real player and will continue to be so as far as we are concerned... something really bizarre would have to happen if he were to leave this club.

He was 45.\nRoss was part of the concussion lawsuit against the NFL. He suffered memory loss, dementia and CTE (chronic traumatic encelphopathy), caused by repeated blows to, or by, the head.\nA wave of former USC and El Toro players came to the inspiring service, which featured members of the Trojans marching band.\nIt was billed as a \u201ccelebration\u201d of Ross\u2019 high-speed life, and it was.\nBut the contradictions of football kept hovering.\n\u201cA lot has been said about football and I think it\u2019s simple, a no-brainer,\u201d ex-quarterback Todd Marinovich told the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t let your kids play Pop Warner or Junior All-American Football. We need to boycott it because we\u2019re just serving up our youth for brain damage.\u201d\nTim Ryan, Ross\u2019 USC teammate who played four years in the NFL, thought about the trade-offs last Thursday. Ryan is now the radio analyst for the San Francisco 49ers. His son played football in high school.\n\u201cI think if I had it to do over again, I\u2019d have him play flag,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to solve this problem until you take the facemask off the helmet. And the NFL should probably give everybody lifetime coverage, like the Veterans Administration.\u201d\nDoctors have said for years that an NFL season is not so different, traumatically, from a tour in Iraq. Scott Ross\u2019 younger brother Jason is a lieutenant colonel. He has pointed out that the military is attaching sensors to soldiers\u2019 helmets, and attacking the problem just as thoroughly as football.\n\u201cBut no matter what you do, you\u2019ll have some morons like me who want to be in the middle of that combat zone,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cScott was up there with the best of them. There was a tradition that went from Rex Moore to San Anno and Matt Gee and Junior Seau and Chris Claiborne. You wear that No. 35 and you\u2019re in the middle of it, and Scott threw himself into every play, literally.\u201d\n\u201cWe beat Oklahoma in 1988 and the way Scott played changed my style of play,\u201d Marinovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way Trojans play.

But I\u2019m actually not sure he should have ever had a car.\u201d\nRoss and Emmanuel were in touch lately, exchanged I-love-yous. Emmanuel remembered what his mother used to tell him: \u201cDon\u2019t bring me flowers after I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nYet not everyone knew Ross\u2019 pain, and not all flowers got delivered.\nHe took one final walk at Calafia State Beach in San Clemente with his cousin Holly, and that\u2019s where his remains were spread.\nGee, a fellow linebacker, did a video tribute from a hospital room.

{{Texas A&M University President Michael Young speaks during Yell Practice on Wednesday, August 29, 2018, where thousands of Texas A&M Aggie fans gathered ahead of Thursday's matchup against the Northwestern State Demons at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. (Ryan Michalesko/The Dallas Morning News)\nA month ago, Texas A&M President Michael Young said he was in favor of rekindling the Aggies' football rivalry with Texas, an idea that didn't go over well with some A&M fans.\nBased on Young's recent emails on the topic, it doesn't appear they have to worry about seeing the Aggies and Longhorns share the field in the foreseeable future.\nIn multiple emails obtained by The News through an open records request, Young said the A&M-Texas football game \"is unlikely to happen.\"\n\"We have no plans to renew the rivalry game at this time for very practical reasons,\" Young wrote on Jan. 22.\nIn a January interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Young and Texas President Gregory Fenves were asked about restarting the rivalry. Both men said they were in favor of renewing the \"Lone Star Showdown.\" A&M and Texas haven't played since 2011, the Aggies' final year as a member of the Big 12, which includes Texas.\nAccording to the Statesman, Young said A&M has been supportive of the notion since A&M joined the SEC.\nHowever, emails suggest things will not change anytime soon.\nAfter his interview in Austin, Young received a handful of emails from A&M fans against the idea of resuming the rivalry. His response to each email was identical, including to one person who said Texas should \"die in their pathetic conference and irrelevant schedule.\"\n\"The topic is of interest to many for or against and we're open to the discussion in line with what is best for the schools,\" Young said in each response. \"There are a variety of reasons that this will be unlikely to happen, including separate conference schedules and scheduling many years out.\"\nYoung declined to comment for this story.\nAdministrators from both universities have made similar comments over the years while their respective athletic directors continue to fill future nonconference schedules. Texas recently announced a home-and-home series for 2028 and 2029 against Georgia, an SEC school.\nTexas is contracted to play at least one \"power five\" opponent every year until 2030, while A&M has one booked every year until 2028.\nHowever, each school could buy out of contracts with future opponents if they wanted to schedule each other. For example, if A&M opted out of its home-and-home series with Arizona State for 2026 and 2027, the Aggies would owe the Sun Devils $2 million.\nAccording to USA Today, no two schools earned more during the 2016-17 school year than Texas and Texas A&M. In 2017-18, athletic departments at each school saw an increase in total operating revenue, according to NCAA reports obtained through open record requests.\nTexas reported a total operating revenue of $219.4 million, while A&M was close behind at $212.4 million.\nOn Thursday, the A&M student senate held a campus-wide vote to see if students support restarting the rivalry. Texas held a similar vote in 2017, with 96.7 percent of voters in favor of playing A&M again.\nEarlier this week, A&M Chancellor John Sharp wrote in an op-ed in the Houston Chronicle that his biggest priority regarding the two schools was making sure they are funded equally.\nTwitter: @Ben_Baby\n}}
{{Alabama\u2019s Peach Bowl Semifinal win over Washington proves \u201cold school\u201d football wins as Bama\u2019s defense leads Tide toward another Championship.\nOld school football espouses establish the run and stop the opponent\u2019s run. In the Peach Bowl, CFB Playoff semi-final Alabama outgained Washington 269 rushing yards to 44. Bo Scarbrough led Bama with 180 yards and a 9.5 yard average.\nArticle continues below ...\nEarly in the 4th quarter a small dose of Chris Petersen\u2019s wizardry pinned the Tide at its own 2 yard-line. Despite a 17-7 Tide lead, the outcome remained in doubt. After two stellar defensive stops against Bama\u2019s Harris and Hurts, the Tide faced a daunting 3rd and nine. In perhaps the defining play of the game, Bo Scarbrough followed the Tide\u2019s left side and bludgeoned his way to a first down.\nA couple of plays later Bo went left again. A combination of good blocking, strong running and a failed desperate arm tackle by a Husky defender resulted in a 68 yard TD. The 4th quarter 98 yard scoring drive was classic, Alabama-style, power football.\nWas Alabama\u2019s 24-7 win over the Washington Huskies a thing of beauty? Seen through Crimson eyes, perhaps it was. Paul Bryant believed \u201coffense sell tickets, defense wins championships.\u201d\nOther than Bo\u2019s heroics, the Tide offense was inconsistent. The stubborn Husky defense and numerous offensive penalties left Bama needing one of its best defensive performances.\nAfter an early Washington touchdown the Tide showed why it leads the nation in so many defensive statistics.\nBesides stuffing U Dub runs and sacking Jake Browning five times, the Tide defense created turnovers. Anthony Averett caused a fumble that was recovered by Jonathan Allen and Ryan Anderson intercepted Browning, returning it 26 yards for the Tide\u2019s 11th defensive TD of the season.\nRushing for an average of 5.4 yards per carry, while holding your opponent to an average of 1.5 yards, is a historically sound formula for winning games.\nThe Tide offense will have to play better on Jan. 9, 2017, but on the last day of 2016, \u201cold school\u201d defensive, football was more than enough to win.\nWhat do you think?

{{A person familiar with the situation tells The Associated Press the NFL plans to change guidelines regarding the way footballs are handled before games.\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity Friday night because details will be discussed at the owners\u2019 meetings in San Francisco next week. The procedural changes result from the \u201cDeflategate\u201d saga. The league wants to avoid the possibility that teams could tamper with footballs, and any change wouldn\u2019t require a vote from owners.\nTom Brady was suspended for four games and the New England Patriots were fined $1 million and docked a pair of draft picks after independent investigator Ted Wells, hired by the NFL, found that the Super Bowl champions used illegally under-inflated balls in the AFC title game. Brady has filed an appeal through the NFL Players Association.\nCurrent rules state that footballs are sent directly to teams. Equipment managers can brush them and even use a damp towel to rub off the oil used to preserve the leather to the preferences of each quarterback. The quarterbacks can even practice with the footballs during a game week as long as the footballs remain in good enough condition to pass the referee\u2019s pre-game inspection as a new ball. Each team brings at least 12 balls.\nThe footballs must be delivered to the officials\u2019 dressing room 2 hours, 15 minutes before kickoff. The referee inspects each one, with a pump provided by the home team to adjust air pressure as needed. Footballs are required to have at least 12.5 psi and no more than 13.5 psi.\nThe referee is the sole judge of whether a ball is fit for play and marks each one approved for the game.

{{SCOTTS VALLEY \u2014 When the Scotts Valley High football team met Half Moon Bay last year, it gave up a late lead and eventually lost.\nThe Falcons made sure that wouldn\u201dt happen again Saturday.\nUsing a tough, ball-control offense, Scotts Valley stayed in control most of the game and pulled off a 34-29 win in its home opener.\nLast year\u201ds contest against the Cougars may not have ended well, but this time around, the Falcons kept momentum on their side.\n\u201cI think this year we got a little more pumped up during halftime, we really took advantage of our lead,\u201d senior running back Alex Benko said.\nNoah Beito made it easy for his team to stay fired up as the half ended. He booted a school-record 48-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. The kick gave the Falcons a much-needed cushion, extending their lead to 17-8.\n\u201cWe had 20 seconds left in the half, so I just had to run out there, line myself up and go for it,\u201d Beito said. \u201cThere\u201ds no time to think about anything.\u201d\nBefore his kick sailed through the uprights, the Falcons were holding onto a 14-8 lead courtesy of two touchdown passes from senior quarterback Jack Pasquini, who finished 13 of 15 for 142 yards.\nHalf Moon Bay answered back with a late 1-yard touchdown run from senior running back Wesley Walters, which capped off a 21-play, 80-yard drive that set the tone for the game. Both teams relied on ground attacks that ran through the gut of the defense, and many of the yards gained by the teams\u201d runners came with defenders on their backs trying to bring them down.\n\u201cIt\u201ds all about second effort,\u201d Benko said. \u201cWhen you\u201dre running the ball down and you get at least one guy on you, you can still keep those feet moving, keep driving.\u201d\nSenior Collin Corbella led the way for the Falcons with 141 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries.\nThings got dramatic in the third quarter, when Walters gashed the Scotts Valley defense for 88- and 86-yard touchdown runs on his way to 287 rushing yards.\nThe Falcons couldn\u201dt get in the end zone in the third, but Beito connected on a 16-yard field goal. After the kick, Walters\u201d second long run gave the Cougars a 23-20 lead going into the fourth.\nCorbella got the lead back with a 1-yard score. Senior running back Victor Passanisi then iced the game with his 20-yard touchdown run after Walters made his only mistake of the day and fumbled away the ball.\nHalf Moon Bay scored a late touchdown to cut into the lead after Passanisi\u201ds run, but the score came with the game virtually over.\n\u201cWe had a lot of kids that stepped up,\u201d Scotts Valley coach Louie Walters said.\n}}
{{He changed lives and made a difference for hundreds of players across the state of Utah and beyond.\nMIDVALE \u2014 In his 18 months as Hillcrest High's head football coach, Cazzie Brown changed the school by convincing the students that they were \"One Pack\" with a responsibility to take care of each other.\nThe extended family that he created in the football program and beyond enveloped and comforted his family in the wake of his unexpected death. Brown, 43, died Sunday night after a brief illness.\nMore than a thousand people \u2014 students from Hillcrest, Judge and Highland \u2014 as well as parents and community members, gathered on the school's football field Monday night for a candlelight vigil meant to honor the bright light that was coach Brown. After all of the players walked together to the 50-yard line carrying pictures of the effusive and energetic coach, the team's captains addressed the crowd gathered around them.\nOne young man played a message from Brown just asking him how he was doing. Another talked about how coach's philosophy made them better people, not just better players. Lineman McKay Ashby recalled how Brown would gather clothing in bags and then let players take what they needed.\n\"He gave them a big, ol' smile, got in his truck and drove away,\" Ashby said of one of the last memories he has of his coach. \"He was always serving all of us.\"\nHe also spoke directly to Brown's wife, Heather, and his oldest son, Bishop, who is a sophomore on the team, telling them that the love he felt for them was evident in how he talked about them. After Ashby's comments, Bishop Brown walked from the crowd to embrace the lineman, while senior captain Ezra Moleni gave the final remarks.\nThe family will hold a celebration of Brown's life at the school, on the football field, Saturday at 10 a.m. The family requested students \"dress like they're going to a football game\" for what is a uniquely coach Caz Brown funeral.\nEarlier in the day, Canyons District spokesman Jeff Haney recalled how Brown began shifting the school's culture within the first 45 minutes of being introduced to his players. He said he delivered that address with the \"passion of a preacher and the bark of a drill sergeant.\"\n\u201cHe fired up this group of kids to have pride in wearing husky green for Friday night lights,\u201d Haney said. \u201cHe had them put away their cell phones, take off their hats, and by the end of the (address) they were yelling \u2018Yes, sir\u2019 and \u2018No, sir\u2019 to every question. It was almost transformative to the way the kids walked in and heard the announcement and then walked out. It was phenomenal to watch, and it was inspiring.\u201d\nWhat Brown accomplished in his brief 18 months at Hillcrest went far beyond the football field. Students said he reached out to all of them, constantly convincing them that they were \"One Pack\" and needed to support and care for each other. He helped the football team earn a berth into last year\u2019s playoffs.\n\u201cHe came on just a season ago,\u201d Haney said. \u201cIn one season, he turned the program into one that was winning. Kids were proud to wear the husky uniform. That\u2019s a huge accomplishment.\u201d\nMaybe even more important, the father of three brought positive energy in just about every way to a school that has suffered tremendous losses in the last two years.\nIn April 2015, assistant principal Dr. Paul Kirby died after suffering a stroke. A month later, two students \u2014 Hunter Kelson, 17, and Cheyenne Bagley, 16 \u2014 were killed in a car accident just before graduation in May.\nLast year a beloved custodian, Lee Ostler, passed away unexpectedly, and then in February of this year, the Unified Police Officer assigned to Hillcrest for several years, Detective Brian Holdaway, died from an undisclosed medical condition at the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\u201cIt seems like the 'Husky Strong' is repeated over and over because of all the traumatic incidents that community has had to face,\u201d Haney said. \u201cAnd they are strong. They are very resilient, and they\u2019ve dealt with so much loss.\u201d\nBefore news of coach Brown\u2019s death was even made public, school administrators and counselors met with the football players and their parents. District officials sent emails and letters to every student at the school explaining the situation, offering resources and giving parents tips on how to recognize signs that their children may be struggling and in need of help.\nBrown coached at Highland before he was hired to take over Hillcrest\u2019s program, overseeing the defensive line and full backs. Highland head coach Brody Benson said that after the two teams played last year, Brown came to their locker room to congratulate the Rams on a quality win.\n\u201cThis was two guys who were very close,\u201d Benson said, \u201ctwo programs that were very competitive. But yet, there was so much respect. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s game will be emotional, but it will not be somber as the two schools plan to honor Brown\u2019s relentless joy and deep passion for the game and what it offers young people.\n\u201cWe talked about the unity we want this week with Highland,\u201d athletic director John Olsen said. \u201cIt was a great, fantastic meeting with all of those guys (coaches from both teams and school administrators). Friday is going to be a celebration of coach Brown. We don\u2019t want it to be a memorial. That will come.\u201d\nThe players will walk onto the field through the Husky tunnel two by two \u2014 one Highland player alongside one Hillcrest player.\n\u201cEvery player on both Hillcrest's and Highland\u2019s teams will wear a decal on their helmet that says \u2018CB\u2019,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a little tribute before the game, and then after the game, as well, we have some things planned with Highland.\u201d\nAdditionally, Summit Academy girls basketball coach Gianni Ellefsen was attempting to organize a state-wide \u2018moment of respect\u2019 before every prep football game in memory of coach Brown.\n\u201cHe changed lives and made a difference for hundreds of players across the state of Utah and beyond,\u201d Ellefsen wrote in an email. \u201cHe also inspired many coaches along the way with his work ethic and mantra of respect and hard work. He will be missed by those who knew him but never forgotten.\u201d\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to support Brown\u2019s wife and three children. On Monday, Olsen told the team that defensive coordinator Will Haws was named interim coach. He'll lead the team with offensive coordinator, Ron Hill, as both men were the first hires Brown made after being hired.\n\"Those are two guys he trusted and he loved,\" Olsen said.\nIn addition to coaching at Hillcrest and Highland, Brown coached at Judge and East and he was a PE teacher at the McGillis School for the last seven years.\nFriends recalled his humor, passion and dedication to the young people with whom he worked. \"He was one of a kind, a good guy,\" Benson said. \"Those kids over at Hillcrest were lucky to have Caz. We all were.\"\n}}

{{UCLA is second-to-last in the Pac-12 in third-down conversions, converting only 36.6 percent of its third-down tries. USC is the only team worse at 36.1 percent.\nHere\u2019s a look at how third-down touches were distributed between running backs and receivers during the first nine games. The boxes that are shaded purple were passing plays and the blue boxes were rushing attempts. Quarterback attempts are shown in the separate box.\nOf UCLA\u2019s 134 third-down attempts, 84 were pass attempts, 41 were rushing plays and nine resulted in sacks, which are recorded as rushing plays for the quarterback, but were likely called pass plays. The Bruins converted 24 of 41 third-down attempts on the ground (58.5 percent) as opposed to just 25 of 84 (29.8 percent) through the air, but, as expected, faced a shorter distance to go on rushing downs. UCLA\u2019s average yards to gain on third downs in which the team passed was 7.8 yards while rushing attempts were with 5.4 yards to go. (In this instance, plays that resulted in sacks were included as \u201cpasses\u201d when calculating the average distance to go.)\nDorian Thompson-Robinson has completed 33.3 percent of his third-down passes while Wilton Speight was at 25.9 percent. Both have thrown one third-down interception this year, but Thompson-Robinson has taken nine third-down sacks to Speight\u2019s none. Opposing defenses aren\u2019t shy about blitzing the young quarterback, especially on third down.\nCaleb Wilson is the most targeted pass-catcher on third down with 20 pass plays intended for the tight end, but Theo Howard is the most successful. Wilson converts 40 percent of his third-down looks while Howard has converted 46.2 percent of his chances.

Demetric Felton, Joshua Kelley and Wilson each had one successful conversion on throws from Speight. Thompson-Robinson appears to favor Wilson, although had a more balanced distribution overall. Of Thompson-Robinson\u2019s 19 successful third-down throws, seven went to Wilson. Kazmeir Allen, Michael Ezeike and Howard each had two, and Kyle Philips, Martell Irby, Dymond Lee, Chase Cota, Felton and Kelley each had one.\nKelley has converted 10 of his 12 third-down rushing attempts with all being third-and-short situations (3 or fewer yards to go).\n}}

{{Phillipsburg High School's football teams during the 1940s, '50s and '60s posted almost 200 wins and just 64 losses. The Stateliners had eight seasons when they lost just one game and four undefeated seasons.\nThere were many outstanding players and some great leaders on those teams, most notably quarterbacks Charlie Meyers, Ray Mantone, Al Geist and Gene Harrison in the '40s; Ken Lutz, Nate Snyder and Dom Viscomi in the '50s, and Herb Bagley, Greg Seifert and Bill Dukett in the '60s.\nMeyers, Harrison, Bagley and Seifert led their teams to undefeated seasons. But it was Harrison, who went on to quarterback the Lafayette College Leopards, who led the Stateliners to a 9-0-0 record in 1949 and the team's only perfect season in the past half-century.\nHarrison was born in Little York, N.J., a stone's throw from Riegel Ridge. He and his parents, the late Edward and Betty Harrison, moved to Phillipsburg a few years later. Harrison attended Freeman Elementary School and played organized football for the first time in seventh grade.\nHarrison's coach at Freeman was Harry Rosenfelt, and during Harrison's time there he played with some of his future teammates -- Russ Dilts, Ron Exley, Jim Ringo, George Chando, Paul Weisel and Jack Gardner.\nHarrison was a reserve during his initial year, as Rosenfelt used the single-wing offense. A year later, when Rosenfelt switched to a T-formation, Harrison became the starting quarterback.\nIn September 1946, Harrison, at 5 feet and 100 pounds, tried out for P'burg football. He thought he possessed a good arm in preseason drills, but he was cut because of his small stature.\n\"I wasn't devastated or anything like that,\" Harrison recalled. \"I just went back to my neighborhood and continued to play football with my friends.\"\nHarrison was back on the practice field the following September, and when time came for uniforms to be passed out, he was again passed over. But Harrison did not let the situation deter him and kept practicing with the team. Two weeks later, when a player quit, Harrison made the junior varsity squad.\nInitially, Harrison alternated with Don Riley at quarterback. But in the middle of his sophomore campaign, Harrison became the jayvees' starting quarterback.\nHe moved up to varsity as a junior and was a backup to starter Homer McRoberts. Harrison played on a team that featured Ringo, who went on to a distinguished career at Syracuse University and in the National Football League with the Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles. The Stateliners finished with a 6-4 record, and for the fourth year in a row came home from Fisher Field with a shutout victory over archrival Easton High School.\nHarrison's 1949 season started out with a bit of misfortune, when he broke his hand in preseason practice after winning the starting job at quarterback. But Harrison healed quickly, and by the time the season opener against West Philadelphia rolled around, he was on the field. The Stateliners, on two TD runs by Dilts, beat West Philadelphia 13-0.\nThe following week, Harrison, who had the responsibility of calling his own plays, had his work cut out for him, as the Stateliners faced the Hurricanes of Bethlehem. A Phillipsburg nemesis for four years, the Hurricanes led 7-0 at halftime. Harrison then orchestrated a 51-yard drive to cut the lead to 7-6 at the end of three quarters, before Dilts ran back a punt 82 yards for the winning points in a 13-7 Stateliners' victory.\nHarrison and P'burg continued to roll, defeating New Brunswick on the losers' field 40-12. A week later, in a battle of the unbeatens, the Stateliners, behind Harrison's two TD passes --one to George Wilchak and the other to Dick Barbadora -- beat the Canaries of Allen High School 25-0.\nPhillipsburg, for the third time in four weeks, then met another undefeated football team, Morristown. Morristown's squad came into the game with a 4-0 mark and a 19-game winning streak stretching three years. The Stateliners and Morristown traded third-quarter touchdowns, but Morristown converted the extra point and led 7-6. Then, fullback Dick Jarvis ran 18 yards for a TD, and P'burg prevailed, 13-7.\nMcKinley Tech and Collingswood were the Garnet and Gray's sixth and seventh victims. Against the former, the Stateliners scored on their first two plays from scrimmage to take a 14-0 lead and then traded touchdowns for the remainder of the game for a 49-35 victory.\nCollingswood invaded Maloney Field on Nov. 5, and, for the fourth time in seven games, coach Frank Klein's squad was up against another undefeated team with a lofty reputation. The Stateliners dominated their South Jersey visitors, breaking their guests' 17-game winning streak with an easy 29-0 win.\nWith the win over Collingswood, the Stateliners propelled themselves to a No. 2 rating in the Garden State behind Montclair. Passaic and Easton were the only opponents standing between the Stateliners and their first perfect season in 14 years.\nPassaic almost threw a monkey wrench into the Stateliners' plans for perfection, losing a hard-fought 20-13 game to P'burg. Harrison's touchdown pass to Dilts tied the game, and a blocked punt gave the Garnet and Gray their winning points.\nWith eight down and one to go, and as they had done all year, the Stateliners came up big again. Against Easton, the team raced to a 19-0 halftime lead and never looked back, defeating the Red Rovers 33-7 to complete a perfect season.\nDilts led the charge with 2 TDs; Harrison, Leo Sokolowsky and Gus Trincheria chipped in with a touchdown apiece.\n\"I wasn't nervous becoming our starting quarterback, because of the great people I had around me,\" Harrison said of his 1949 season. \"Our team was always very businesslike, and it started with our co-captains Russ Dilts and Ron Exley.\n\"They were both first team all-state selections, and I couldn't have had the year I had without paying tribute to our line, players like George Wilchak, Sully Morgan, Dick Barbadora, Paul Weisel, Konrad Mellert and Jim Lutz.\"\nHarrison crossed the Delaware River to attend Lafayette. He and Exley won Maroon Club scholarships to continue their careers as Leopards. During his first year on College Hill, Harrison played and was a starter on the Leopard freshman team under the legendary Charley Gelbert, who made another claim to fame as the Maroon and White's baseball boss.\nHarrison won the job as starting varsity quarterback as a sophomore. Maurice \"Clipper\" Smith, who recruited Harrison, was in his last season as Lafayette's head football coach. The Leopards played a killer schedule and won only two games.\n}}
{{One day after music mogul Diddy was arrested on the campus of UCLA for allegedly attacking a football coach who had yelled at his son, a reserve Bruins cornerback, the most absurd sports story of the summer only got more bizarre.\nOn Tuesday, a defensive Instagram post from Diddy's son, a gold-medal throwback tweet from a peripheral player in this post-modern drama, emerged, as well as a sources-say report that Diddy swung a kettlebell (a kettlebell!) at a UCLA team intern.\nSee also: Diddy arrested for allegedly attacking UCLA football coach\nThis is definitely the strangest college football story to come out of Southern California since that USC star's bogus yarn about hurting his ankles jumping from a second-story balcony to save his drowning nephew.\nBut we digress. Below is everything you need to get up to speed on the beef that is Diddy vs. UCLA football.\nThe backstory\nJustin Dior Combs is the son of Diddy, whose given name, you'll recall, is Sean Combs. Justin Dior Combs (a name only done justice by reciting the entire thing) was a two-star football recruit out of high school at Iona Prep in New York. He was the nation's 132nd ranked cornerback recruit, according to UCLA athletics' official site. He's a redshirt junior for the Bruins with four total tackles in two seasons of playing time.\n(Meanwhile, Snoop Dogg's son, Cordell Broadus, is a more highly-ranked recruit sent to join the Bruins next season as a wide receiver. But that's a different topic for a different day.)\nThe allegations\nThese are kettlebells. Image: Jeff Lautenberger/Evening Sun/Associated Press\nOn Monday afternoon, TMZ broke news that Diddy had been arrested at UCLA following an alleged attack on an unnamed football coach. That was corroborated when UCLA posted this statement to its official athletics site.\nShortly after 12:30 p.m. today, Sean Combs (also known as P. Diddy) was arrested at UCLA\u2019s Acosta Athletic Training Complex on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, which was a kettlebell. No one was seriously injured and UCPD is investigating. Combs is expected to be transported to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Inmate Reception Center later this evening.\nA kettlebell! Please, tell me more ...\nBut not so fast!\nUCLA plays its home games at the world-famous Rose Bowl. Image: Harry How/Getty Images\nDiddy reps released a statement on Tuesday saying that Diddy did no dirt.\nThe various accounts of the event and charges that are being reported are wholly inaccurate. What we can say now is that any actions taken by Mr. Combs were solely defensive in nature to protect himself and his son. We are confident that once the true facts are revealed, the case will be dismissed.\nIn defense of daddy Diddy\nAlso on Tuesday, Justin Dior Combs posted a message on Instagram defending his father in whatever passed between him and UCLA staffers. The caption read: \"I thank God for having a father that's always there for me.. Love you pops!\"\nA photo posted by Justin Dior Combs (@princejdc) on Jun 23, 2015 at 1:39pm PDT\nImplied in that caption was a sequence of \"100\" emojis. In any event, it would not appear likely that Justin Dior Combs will be a Bruin this season.\nAlso on Tuesday, Diddy posted the same photo to Instagram, accompanying it with the caption, \"#FAMILYFIRST.\"\n\"Bless up,\" chimed in a commenter named @breannacain.\nBut this story's not over yet \u2014 oh boy, not by a long shot.\nThe (alleged) kettlebell\nBruin Report Online is a site that covers all things UCLA sports and is a go-to source of scoops for Bruins fans. On Tuesday morning it posted what it says are more details of the clash between Diddy and UCLA football personnel, according to sources in the know.\nYou can read the full BRO report, but here are some choice excerpts.\nFirst, more context:\nThe incident began early Monday morning when Justin Combs, Diddy\u2019s son, was participating in an off-season workout on UCLA\u2019s field. According to sources, Combs, who will be a redshirt junior defensive back this fall, had missed some recent workouts and wasn\u2019t giving a great effort Monday morning, so UCLA strength and conditioning coach Sal Alosi kicked him out of the session.\nAnd now some color:\nMany sources who were in the locker room witnessed an angered Diddy enter Alosi\u2019s office, rattling off expletives at the coach. Alosi then instructed interns who were immediately outside his office to alert campus security ... Alosi, then, according to witnesses, put up his hand in a non-threatening way, and instructed Combs to get his father out of the office. Diddy then walked into Alosi\u2019s hand, and told Alosi not to put his hands on him.\nKettlebell alert:\nIn the next moment, according to many on the scene, Diddy attacked Alosi, until interns and other personnel pulled off Diddy. The celebrity broke free again at one point and struck Alosi. The personnel were then successful in getting Diddy out of the office and into the weight room, where Diddy picked up a kettlebell, which is a weight that resembles a cannonball with a handle, and then swung it at one of the interns.\nDoes the name Sal Alosi sound familiar? If so, here's why.\nA golden tweet\nAlosi's name last came up in the news in ignominious fashion back in 2010, when he was strength and conditioning coach for the NFL's New York Jets. During a game that season, Alosi entered the NFL Hall of Shame when he was caught on camera appearing to purposefully trip an opposing player from the Miami Dolphins during a live punt return.\nThe player felled by Alosi that day was Nolan Carroll, who now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. After hearing about the incident at UCLA, Carroll hypothesized that perhaps Diddy was taking some delayed revenge on his behalf and posted the most excellent of tweets to express his gratitude.\nSomeone told me @iamdiddy has my back \u2014 Nolan Carroll (@CarrollCity) June 23, 2015\nLet there be memes\nAn Internet spectacle is not complete until the meme-makers have their say, and Diddy vs. UCLA football has been no exception. Let's highlight a few favorites.\nA little 'Suge Knight at the 1995 Source Awards' redux:\nI heard abt @iamdiddy fighting UCLA coaches over his son getting yelled at.

McKnight has averaged 6.1 yards in 36 carries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I feel really comfortable with right now, going with Chauncey as the starter and Stafon doing his thing and then Joe coming in,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201d\nCarroll said the only misgiving he has is that it took seven games to settle on a three-man rotation.\n\u201cI really wished we\u2019d have been able to figure it out sooner,\u201d he said.\nCarroll said he is not starting Washington because he feared the younger players might fumble, especially with a game at Oregon this week.\n\u201cNot anymore, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are all ready to go.\u201d\nJohnson said he is currently 80 percent recovered from his sprained foot. His foot got tangled in a pile of players against Notre Dame but he said he feels much better than a week ago.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even run last Monday,\u201d Johnson said.\nCarroll said sophomore Vidal Hazelton is a solid starter at wide receiver and early-season starter David Ausberry will continue to back up Hazelton.\nQuarterback quandary\nJohn David Booty will throw today to test his swollen finger. Last week, his finger swelled up after he threw. Booty said he wants to start against Oregon.\n\u201cYou have to be that way,\u201d Booty said.\nBooty said he will not throw with the glove he wore last week to protect the finger.\nCarroll said he will to see how Booty responds to throwing and Mark Sanchez will continue to work with the first-team offense.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s this week or next week, (Booty) should make a turn soon,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be healed yet. Maybe he can withstand it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Sanchez said he\u2019s noticed a big difference in his life since becoming the starter.\n\u201cMy dad said my whole life would change, the way I walked would be different, the way I talked . . . it totally has,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heavyweight fighter \u2013 once you win the title, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nSanchez was unaware anyone noticed he wore a mouthpiece with a Mexican flag imprinted on it against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece was designed by a team dentist, who is not Mexican, but is also of Latin descent.\n\u201cIt was sweet, I had to wear it,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cIt\u2019s my heritage. I think the L.A. fans liked it better than the Notre Dame fans. That means a lot to me to play for my community.\u201d\nWelcome back\nSix players returned to practice Monday, mostly offensive linemen. Tackle Sam Baker (hamstring) remains questionable but is going to try to play this week. Offensive guard Zack Heberer (shoulder) is allowed to do some drills but is not cleared for contact. Tackles Charles Brown and Thomas Herring (sprained ankles) also returned.\nscott.wolf@dailynews.com\n}}

{{BY MARK JAFFEE\nREPUBLICAN-AMERICAN\nSOUTHINGTON \u2014 When John Marinelli was hired to be the Greenwich High head football coach in the spring of 2015, his first phone call was placed to a close friend, Jordan Capitanio of Torrington.\nThe two were teammates during a postgraduate year at Canterbury in New Milford in 2005.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s CIAC championship football luncheon at the Aqua Turf Club, Marinelli talked candidly of the impact that Capitanio has made on both sides of the ball for the Cardinals.\nCapitanio is coaching the offensive line and running backs, and previously coached defensive backs.\n\u201cJordan has a brilliant mind,\u201d said Marinelli. \u201cWhen I called him asking if he wanted to join the staff, he didn\u2019t believe me. He\u2019s a great role model for kids. He relocated for me. He brings such a passion and energy every single day. I have a special place in my heart for him and his family.\u201d\nTop-seeded Greenwich (12-0) plays No. 3 Darien (11-1) for the Class LL state title Saturday at 11 a.m. at Boyle Stadium.\nThe Cardinals haven\u2019t won a state title since 2007.\n\u201cIt means a lot to be a part of the change and the revitalization of the program and the expectation and excitement that it\u2019s bringing,\u201d said Capitanio, now 31. \u201cIt\u2019s very rewarding to see. I wasn\u2019t strategically planning and aggressively pursuing coaching jobs, but John and I stayed in touch throughout the years. It has worked out very well.\u201d\nCapitanio works for Ceci Brothers Landscaping in Greenwich. He briefly moved into a condo with friend, Justin Meneguzzo in Stamford when he took the Cardinals\u2019 job in 2015 before settling on in his own place in New Canaan.\nCaptanio played quarterback and running back at Torrington, and graduated in 2004,. He was an All-New England running back at Canterbury and later at Western New England University, where he was a team MVP in 2008. Professionally, he played for the Ljubljana Silver Hawks in Slovenia in the Central European Football League. Capitanio returned home to Torrington in 2010, coaching at his alma mater.\nOn the mend: Ansonia senior quarterback Justin Lopez, who was sidelined for last Sunday\u2019s 52-19 semifinal win over Stafford/East Windsor/Somers, was still not cleared to practice as of Tuesday afternoon after injuring his right knee last week in practice, according to Chargers\u2019 coach Tom Brockett.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still hoping that he will be cleared to practice this week,\u201d said Brockett. If Lopez can\u2019t go, sophomore Tyler Cafaro will get his second straight start.\nFond memories: A dozen years ago, Shane Kingsley of Beacon Falls was a key figure in the landscape of the upstart Woodland program, which captured two Naugatuck Valley League crowns and back-to-back Class SS state titles in 2004 (35-0 win over Holy Cross) and 2005 (19-13 over Brookfield), respectively. Woodland opened in the fall of 2001 and its first varsity season was in 2002 with an independent schedule. The Hawks joined the NVL in 2003.\nKingsley intercepted a pass in the closing minutes near the Hawks\u2019 goal line to seal the win over Brookfield.\n\u201cAlex Dorosh (Hawks\u2019 QB) kneeled on the ball to end the game,\u201d recalled Kingsley.\u201dIt was such a big relief. We had graduated 24 seniors from the year before. I don\u2019t think anyone but us thought we would have a chance to repeat as champions. We had such great leadership (Mike Stankus, Jeff Temple and Jeff Jones and Kingsley were captains). We were so excited to have another chance to prove ourselves.\u201d\nIn the 2005 game against Brookfield and future UConn standout Scott Lutrus, Jones scored two TDs and Dorosh tossed a TD pass to Will Volage on the Hawks\u2019 opening play from scrimmage following an interception by Woodland\u2019s Anthony Cassetti.\n\u201cI remember it being very cold night at Trumbull High, but I didn\u2019t wear long sleeves; I never did,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, the weather conditions don\u2019t matter, especially when you\u2019re winning.\u201d\nNow, in his third season as an Ansonia assistant football coach and the head Chargers\u2019 boys basketball coach, Kingsley is also a business teacher at Ansonia.\nPrime locale: Daniel Hand of Madison athletic director Craig Semple, a Waterbury native, oversaw the interview process of first-year head coach David Mastroianni, who has his Tigers in the Class L state final against Masuk on Saturday. Hand\u2019s two previous coaches are legendary figures \u2014 Larry Ciotti (141-43-2 record, four state titles from 1970-1988) and Steve Filippone (223-81-5, seven state titles. 1989-2013)\n\u201cWe had 20 qualified applicants and interviewed eight with three finalists,\u201d said Semple. \u201cDave was the defensive coordinator here for 10 years. Our defense has been the hallmark of our program for a long time.\u201d\nHand (11-1) plays Masuk of Monroe (11-1) Saturday for the Class L crown Saturday at Veterans Field in New Britain. Semple is a 1982 Wilby High graduate and former teacher and football assistant coach on the staffs of then Wildcats\u2019 head coaches Jim Vicario and Don Boland. He left Wilby in 2000 and became the athletic director at New Fairfield before taking on the AD role at Hand in 2004.\nLearning the ropes: First-year CIAC Football Committee member John Ferrazzi attended the luncheon for the first time. After 13 seasons, the Waterbury native and 1997 Kennedy High graduate got his Sheehan of Wallingford team into the postseason this year for the first time. Joel Barlow of Redding beat the Titans, 47-34, in the Class M quarterfinals.\n\u201cWe had only three senior starters and will return eight on offense and eight on defense next year,\u201d said Ferrazzi, 38, who now resides in Wolcott. \u201cThe young kids got a taste of what the postseason will be like and now have that hunger. What we need to learn is to be consistent. The kids were competitive and hustled and played hard. We just came up against a tough draw (Joel Barlow is coached by Rob Tynan).\u201d\nReach Mark Jaffee at mjaffee@rep-am.com or follow him on Twitter@TheRealJaffman\nAdvertisement\n}}
{{When you have been released by NFL teams as often as former Gustavus Adolphus wideout Ryan Hoag has \u2014 seven times by five organizations, to be precise \u2014 you learn to appreciate a moment of success, even if it\u2019s not in the league you ultimately hope to be.\nSix years after the Oakland Raiders took Hoag with the final pick of the 2003 draft, making him the so-called Mr. Irrelevant (a semi-gag award given to the last player chosen every year), Hoag made the opening-night roster of the New York Sentinels in the United Football League. Never heard of the UFL? It\u2019s a four-team startup minor league, and you\u2019re probably more familiar with the names of the coaches \u2014 Dennis Green and Jim Fassel, to name two \u2014 than most of the players.\nHoag harbors the same dream as everyone else, though at 29 the window of opportunity is closing on his fingers. But Hoag\u2019s perseverance so impressed the Sentinels head coach Ted Cottrell \u2014 yes, the former Vikings\u2019 defensive coordinator \u2014 that after the final cuts, Cottrell lauded Hoag in a team meeting and asked him to tell the others his story.\nAccolades from the coach\n\u201cIt shocked me,\u201d Hoag said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cIt was something I didn\u2019t see coming.\n\u201cIt felt good, I\u2019ll tell you that. I felt proud to be in that room. To get a shout-out from the head coach in front of the whole team, that was special.\u201d\nGustavus alums and fans followed Hoag\u2019s progress in a blog he writes for the athletic department\u2019s website. (He also gained a fair share of attention during his 2008 appearance on ABC\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Bacherlorette.\u201d)\nufl-football.com Ryan Hoag\nHoag\u2019s pro football resume reads like that of a guy who can\u2019t take a hint. Since Oakland drafted him in \u201903 after a stellar career with the Division III Gusties, Hoag has been cut by, in order, the Raiders, the Giants, the Vikings (twice), the Redskins (twice), the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nHe spent parts of four seasons on NFL and CFL practice squads, and was briefly with Berlin in NFL Europe. Hoag has never played a down in the NFL, coming closest in 2004, when he spent three weeks on the Vikings\u2019 active roster without suiting up for a game.\nSo why keep at it? Because as recently as last year, Hoag made it to final cut-down day before the Jaguars released him. He\u2019s been so close so many times, he said, that he wants to exhaust every possible chance so he\u2019ll have no regrets when he finally moves on to teaching and coaching.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been going to training camp, I\u2019m a bum, and I\u2019m the first guy cut,\u201d Hoag said. \u201cIf it came to that, if I\u2019m not cutting it, I\u2019d say I\u2019m not cut out for it and go on to something else.\u201d\nOld Viking connections\nThose old Vikings connections helped Hoag hook on with the Sentinels. Besides Cottrell, the staff includes offensive coordinator Wes Chandler, who was Hoag\u2019s receivers coach with the Vikes. And John Tice, brother of Mike and another former Vikes\u2019 assistant, coaches the offensive line.\nThough Hoag had, by his estimation, his worst training camp ever, his special teams play earned him a roster spot. Hoag has yet to catch a pass in the Sentinels\u2019 first two games, but he plays on all four special teams. That\u2019s where Hoag pins his NFL hopes.\nThe UFL has no affiliation with the NFL, but it does have a television contract, with Versus. Though its four franchises bear geographic names, only one is based accordingly. Two train in Orlando, Fla. (New York and Florida) and two in Arizona (California, Las Vegas). Hoag and his teammates practice at the Citrus Bowl and live in a resort near Disney World.\nEach team plays six games at various venues. On Thursday, the Sentinels are scheduled to face California in a televised game at Giants Stadium (6 p.m. Central time, Versus). Both teams are 0-2. New York\u2019s next two \u201chome\u201d games are at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., and then in Hartford, Conn. The Hofstra game had been scheduled for Citi Field, the new home of the New York Mets. The league\u2019s championship game will be Nov. 27 in Las Vegas.\nHe\u2019s clearly not doing it for the money but, rather, for the chance to catch on again with a pro team. Best guess: Hoag is probably making at least as much as he would on an NFL practice squad (a minimum of $5,200 a week) but way less than the NFL player minimum (a little more than $18,000 a week).\nHoag said the league allows players to negotiate with NFL teams beginning Nov. 1 and can sign Nov. 20. That\u2019s the day the UFL regular season ends, and three days before Hoag turns 30. No wonder Hoag referenced Vince Papale, the subject of the movie \u201cInvincible,\u201d as his inspiration. The Eagles signed Papale as a 30-year-old rookie wideout and special-teams player in 1976, and he hung on for three seasons.\n\u201cVince Papale did it,\u201d Hoag said, \u201cso why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n}}
{{Former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno's son and longtime assistant, Jay Paterno, has filed a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages from the university for his January 2012 dismissal from the football staff.\nJay Paterno speaks during a debate at the Pennsylvania Progressive Summit March 1, during an aborted candidacy for lieutenant governor. The former Penn State assistant football coach is now suing Penn State for firing him at the height of the Sandusky scandal.\nThe suit, filed Monday in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Paterno's dismissal \"at the heighth of the Sandusky scandal's dark shroud\" effectively killed his chances at future employment in the major college coaching or broadcasting ranks.\nThe firing, followed by the release of the Freeh Report on the Sandusky scandal and the university's acceptance of the NCAA consent decree, combined, Jay Paterno argues, to tag him with a \"pariah status... that was wholly undeserved.\"\nThe suit, filed with former PSU coach Bill Kenney, seeks $1 million in damages for the \"deprivation... of reputation without due process of law.\"\nRead more on the latest court action to grow out of the Jerry Sandusky scandal and its aftermath at Penn State.\n}}
{{Redskins owner Daniel Snyder seems to be serious about making a dramatic change to the manner in which the franchise he has owned for more than a decade is managed.\nGone is long-time Snyder confidant Vinny Cerrato, and Snyder seems to be willing to keep his ladle out of the soup moving forward. (Then again, Snyder tried that approach in 2001 \u2014 and it lasted for a year.)\nBut Snyder needs to make one more change in order to properly break from his fantasy-football mindset of seasons past.\nHe needs to get rid of defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth.\nMore accurately, G.M. Bruce Allen needs to make the decision to get rid of Haynesworth, and Snyder needs to let Allen implement it.\nHaynesworth is far more trouble than he\u2019s worth, as Haynesworth\u2019s recent actions have demonstrated. Sure, he\u2019s talented. But he\u2019s a divisive personality who can\u2019t deal with adversity and can\u2019t stay healthy and the Redskins never should have signed him.\nMaking the move easier in 2010 will be the absence of the salary cap. With no cap, there will be no cap consequences, allowing the Redskins to dump Haynesworth and move on.\nSo put him on the trading block. Someone else will think they can get through to him, even though in reality not even Vince Lombardi could get this guy to give his all on every snap.\nThe only argument in favor of keeping Haynesworth around is that they have given him $40 million in guaranteed money and he has the potential to be dominant. Still, if the goal is to win a Super Bowl, Haynesworth is likely to do more harm than good in that regard \u2014 especially if the team encounters any adversity in 2010.\n}}
{{\u00d7 2018 Fantasy Football: Week 14 Thursday night start \u2019em or sit \u2019em\nBy Joe Hopkins\nI hope you enjoy defense because tonight\u2019s showdown between the Jaguars and Titans will likely be a low-scoring affair. Both Jacksonville and Tennessee rank in the bottom five in points scored, while their defenses have surrendered the fifth and sixth-fewest points, respectively. Though the Jaguars have been all but eliminated from the playoffs, they would certainly relish playing the spoilers for the Titans, who find themselves one games back from a wild card spot.\nEach week I sift through the schedule to find the best and worst match-ups in fantasy football. I chose two quarterbacks, two tight ends and two defenses to start, along with three running backs and three receivers. I then find the same number at each position to sit and detail the reasons why.\nAny players from the Thursday game that make the list are featured in this standalone article. The rest of the list is released on Saturday so to advise you with the most up-to-date information available.\nI make these suggestions based on each player\u2019s weekly match-ups, surrounding talent and in-game usage. While predicting the future is anything but easy, using these tools can help us make better choices when determining which players we start or sit from week to week.\nFor more help with your lineup check out The Wolf\u2019s weekly rankings.\nStart\nDefense\nJacksonville Jaguars:\nThe Colts were averaging 29.5 points per game before being shutout by Jacksonville last week. The Jaguars have been stingy all season, giving up the third-fewest yards (315.6) and fifth-fewest points (20.2) on a per game basis. Lately, they\u2019ve created more of the big plays that made them so special last year, forcing multiple turnovers and multiple sacks in two of the last three weeks. Tonight, Jacksonville aims to feast on a Titans offense that has mustered up the fifth-fewest points (18.4) and yards (310.2) per game, while allowing the second-most sacks (42).\nSit\nWide Receiver\nCorey Davis:\nConsistent targets are beginning to translate into consistent production for Davis, who\u2019s scored three touchdowns over his last four games. The issue this week lies in a brutal matchup with a Jaguars defense that has allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points (PPR) to opposing receivers. Jacksonville has surrendered the fewest passing touchdowns (15) and the third-fewest passing yards per game (207.2) this season.\nCheck back on Saturday for the full slate of Start/Sits.\n}}
{{Texas Longhorns wide receiver Collin Johnson (9) is tackled by USC Trojans linebacker Cameron Smith (35) and cornerback Iman Marshall (8) during the first quarter of an NCAA football game between the Texas Longhorns and the USC Trojans on Saturday, September 15, 2018 at Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas. (Ashley Landis/The Dallas Morning News)\nAny mention of the Big 12 and the Pac-12 joining forces can quickly ignite speculation and rekindle memories.\nRemember the grandiose plans for a Pac-16 that had the Big 12 close to flat-lining at one point? Yeah, super-conferences, realignment, hard feelings, accusatory billboards.\nGood times.\nThe most recent catalyst was a proposal for less ambitious \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d in football between the two leagues by retired Kansas State president Jon Wefald. The proposal was obtained by the San Jose Mercury News in a story Tuesday. West Virginia President Gordon Gee, the head of the Big 12\u2019s board of directors, had given his OK for Wefald to look at ways to strengthen the conference in 2017, according to the Mercury News.\nGee didn\u2019t not immediately return a phone message Tuesday. In emails obtained by the Mercury News, Gee told Wefald that he had shared the proposal with other Big 12 presidents.\nWefald initially looked at trying to lure Arizona and Arizona State to the Big 12. He soon switched gears, suggesting the Big 12 to play all 30 of its non-conference games against the Pac-12, power conference against power conference, resulting in an 11-page document, the Mercury News said. With 12 members, the Pac-12 would have to schedule six additional non-conference games each season.\nCalling all Red Raider fans: sign up for our Texas Tech newsletter HERE!\nWhile not new, this is the most detailed proposal to come to light. Just don\u2019t hold your breath, at least in this framework.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about to the Pac-12 and other conferences about collaboration,\u201d Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cThere is nothing that is imminent but I expect we\u2019ll continue to have those kind of conversations because there are synergies that might be appropriate. Playing all of our non-conference games against one conference is certainly a non-starter and we don\u2019t have any collaborations that are active at the present time.\u201d\nIn 2017, it made sense for the Big 12 to get creative, explore options and think outside the box. The league was going through a significant amount of soul-searching prompted by then Oklahoma President David Boren, including the way-too-public expansion sweepstakes. Stability was in question.\nNow, the landscape has changed.\nThe Big 12 has made the College Football Playoff the last two seasons, thanks to OU. The per school revenue should reach more than $40 million this year and rank behind only the Big Ten and the SEC. The Pac-12 is now the power conference with the image problem after missing the CFP the last two seasons and being in the midst of a disastrous men\u2019s basketball season.\nPlus, as Bowlsby noted, Big 12 schools have a financial model that features seven home football games.

{{Last week, Boston College football fans got a glimpse into what life was like without A.J. Dillon. What ensued was three quarters of an anemic offense, followed by an inspired fourth-quarter comeback that fell just short of a victory against North Carolina State. The Eagles (4-2, 1-1 Atlantic Coast) have six more conference games ahead of them. At the halfway point of the season, the Eagles have had their share of ups and downs, and it remains to be seen how they handle this next bit of adversity.\nLouisville (2-4, 0-3) will visit Alumni Stadium following three-consecutive conference losses, two of the blowout variety. While BC looks to have control on paper, Purdue had also lost three-straight before dismantling the Eagles. The Cardinals seem to be suffering from the Lamar Jackson hangover, struggling to get their offense going, while ranking near the bottom of the FBS in rushing defense. The Eagles will hope to get back over .500 in ACC play by defeating a struggling Cardinals team.\nWho is BC playing?\nLouisville\nWhen is BC playing?\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 12:30 p.m.\nWhere is BC playing?\nAlumni Stadium, Chestnut Hill, Mass.\nHow to Watch:\nThis game will be available locally on NESN and can also be livestreamed on WatchESPN via the ACC Digital Network.\nBy the Numbers:\nBC:\n1) BC is averaging 222.8 rushing yards per game. Steve Addazio\u2019s offense has relied upon the ground attack, attempting more rushes than passes halfway through the season. Much of this success should be attributed to Dillon, but Ben Glines has done a nice job in his absence, averaging 105 yards in the last two contests.\n2) The Eagles have only attempted two field goals this season. While much of this can be chalked up to game flow, manageable fourth-down distance, and an injury to Colton Lichtenberg, it undermines the glaring lack of confidence in a special teams unit that had been catastrophic for the Eagles until last weekend.\n3) Zach Allen has been the heart of the defensive line, notching eight tackles for loss and three-and-a-half sacks. The future NFL draftee has been very active in batting down passes at the line of scrimmage, as well as drawing holding penalties on opposing tackles, making quarterbacks uncomfortable in the pocket.\nLouisville:\n1) The Cardinals are allowing 32.67 points per game. Although Louisville has always been known as an offensive juggernaut, this season, the defense has not really given the offense much of a shot to stay in games. Opposing rushing attacks are tearing up the Cardinals, as they\u2019ve given 599 more yards than they\u2019ve run for themselves.\n2) Jawon Pass, the successor at quarterback to Lamar Jackson, has struggled early, throwing seven interceptions to just six touchdowns. He\u2019s completing under 55 percent of his passes and has not offered much on the ground either, turning 32 attempts into -15 yards.\n3) Field goal kicking has been a bright spot for the Cardinals, where Blanton Creque has converted 6-of-6 field goal attempts, including three from 40-plus yards. The junior is also a perfect 15-for-15 on extra points.\nLast Meeting:\nThe meeting between these sides last year was Dillon\u2019s breakout performance. His move to beat now-Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander could be described as the \u201cstiff-arm heard \u2019round the world.\u201d Dillon rushed for 272 yards and four touchdowns in a back-and-forth affair that saw the Eagles win, 45-42, on a Lichtenberg field goal when time expired. It marked the first game of BC\u2019s three-game conference win streak that would carry it to a bowl berth.\nOutlook:\nOn Saturday morning, Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Pete Thamel reported that Dillon will sit out this weekend\u2019s game. That said, even without Dillon, the weak spot of the Cardinals defense is on the ground, and the strength of the Eagles offense is exactly that. BC will run the rock as much as possible, contrasting the rushing attack with play-action. Creative play-calling on the offensive front could also help the Eagles come away with a victory, especially if they mix it up on first down. Continuous power running on first down has led to the Eagles establishing the ground game, but it has also become predictable and leaves the offense with a lot of second-and-longs. Tossing in jet sweeps and spread formations could catch Louisville off guard.\nBC\u2019s defense played well in the second half last week, only allowing one touchdown in the final two quarters. The difference was that BC was controlling the ball. Because the Eagles run an up-tempo offense, the defense needs them to pick up at least one first down to be fully energized to take the field for the next drive. When BC\u2019s offense goes three-and-out, it puts the defense in a much tougher spot to be successful when playing on tired legs.\nJim Reid\u2019s unit will try to create as many third-and-longs as possible, as the Cardinals have been dreadful converting those types of situations this season. Louisville has converted just 39 percent of its third downs, and forcing longer attempts could lead to more mistakes from Pass that the Eagles could very well turn into takeaways.\nFeatured Image by Timothy D.

{{In just five years Arpad Paszkany has taken his local club from Romania's third division to the top of Liga 1, writes Jonathan Wilson. Now he has designs on conquering Europe\nRemember Michael Knighton turning up at Carlisle in 1994 and promising Champions League football within a decade? How everybody laughed. And how vindicated they were when, 10 years later, the Cumbrians ended up being relegated to the Conference. Most Romanians expected something similar when the Transylvanian tycoon Arpad Paszkany took over at his local third-division side CFR Cluj in January 2002.\nWhen he vowed he would have them in Liga 1 within four years, there were cynical smirks and shakes of the head. This, after all, is a side that lived in the shadow of Universitatea Cluj, who were no giants themselves. Despite a history stretching back to 1907, CFR had managed only one spell in the top flight, between 1969 and 1976. Yet six years on, they are not merely in Liga 1, but go into the winter break unbeaten and 11 points clear at the top of the table. This Icarus is soaring.\nNot that anybody in Cluj is counting any chickens. Rapid Bucharest, in second, have a game in hand, and were they to win that, they would trail by eight points, precisely the lead CFR squandered to concede the second Champions League qualifying spot to Steaua Bucharest last season. That slip-up might have discouraged other owners, but not Paszkany, who embarked on a summer of spending. The trend elsewhere in Romania is to produce your own talent, but Paszknay has had no qualms about packing his squad with foreigners.\nHe signed 13 players in the summer, of which only two, Eugen Trica and Radu Marginean, are Romanian. The most expensive was the Argentinian forward Cristian Fabbiani, bought from Lanus for \u00a31.5m. Nicknamed The Ogre for his brooding physical presence, he is likely to play for Romania at Euro 2008 if his citizenship can be processed in time.\n\"Before I agreed to come here, all my friends tried to stop me,\" he said, \"but I was curious, and now I'm really happy. The title is already ours, in my opinion, and even if other people aren't convinced, we have to start preparing in the spring to try to make a big impact in the Champions League. I'm very encouraged by our performance and I would advise any foreigner who is given the chance to play in Romania not to hesitate.\"\nHis compatriot Emmanuel Culio, a midfielder signed from Colo Colo, the Swedish defender Niklas Sandberg and the Brazilian forward Didi have all impressed, but CFR's most popular player remains the Portuguese winger Semedo, who is known as Eddie Murphy because of his supposed resemblance to the American comedian.\nThere will be more signings this winter. Mikael Dorsin, the Sweden left-back, has already agreed terms, and he likely to be joined by his Rosenborg team-mate, the Ivorian striker Yssouf Kone. Paszkany has already said that if his side wins the title this season, he will invest \u00a360m in the squad next summer for a proper assault on the Champions League. Romania's coefficient has risen sufficiently that, for the first time, their champions will be guaranteed a place in the group stages.\n\"I'm ready to give a quarter of my fortune to build the strongest team Romanian football has ever known,\" Paszkany said. \"We already have impressive Romanian players like Trica in reserve, but this winter and next summer I will look to bring in top-class foreigners. There are also some big names in the Romanian league who are interested in our project, so we'll see about them.\"\nThere are those, naturally, who accuse CFR of having bought success simply by having a far larger transfer budget than any of their rivals, but there are also more damaging claims. Match-fixing has seemingly been in abeyance in Romania since 2002, when the president of the Romanian Football Federation Mircea Sandu called the club presidents together, encouraged them to confess previous crimes and declared \"Zero Hour\", but there are widespread allegations that Cluj have been offering inducements to match officials. \"It's obvious,\" said the Politehnica Timisoara owner Marian Iancu. \"In the future my side won't play against them unless we can have a foreign referee.\"\nIs it only coincidence, their critics ask, that the one time CFR had to play without Romanian referees, against Anorthosis Famagusta in the Uefa Cup, they were beaten 3-1 at home and went out after a draw in Cyprus? Gigi Becali, Steaua's controversial owner, was goaded into another of his regular outbursts by a penalty CFR were awarded away to Gloria Bistrita when they trailed 2-1. \"You saw Cristiana Balaj [the referee] present them with a gift,\" he raged. \"Maybe Fabbiani fell over the wind, because there was no opponent anywhere near him. And that's the fourth or fifth time referees have helped CFR.\"\nSuch accusations may, as CFR claim, be born out of jealousy, and they are, anyway, almost impossible to prove. Nonetheless, sympathy in Romania tends to have swung towards Unirea Urziceni, who are coached by the former Chelsea and Steaua defender Dan Petrescu. Urziceni is a rural market town of just 17,000 inhabitants - its name derives from the Romanain for 'nettle' - and Unirea were only promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2006, but they are one of four teams level on points in second.\nTheirs may be the true fairy-story, but it is what is happening in the north-west that should make Europe take notice. It may not be palatable, but the truth is that it is only with such substantial investment that eastern clubs will be able to rise to compete with the west. \"I've never worked with such great financial potential,\" said CFR's coach Ioan Andone.\nNor has anyone else in Romania, and there may not be another club in Europe spending \u00a360million next summer. If only Michael Knighton had had those sort of resources.\n}}

{{Derk Sauer is a little Dutchman who became a media mogul in Russia. His company publishes 30-odd titles including Russian Cosmopolitan, Playboy and, until recently, an obscure football magazine. \u201cA very nice magazine but it just wasn\u2019t selling,\u201d he told me over breakfast in Amsterdam last month. Then one day somebody phoned offering to buy it. Sauer wondered why anyone would want such a thing. He asked who the buyer was. It was, of course, the oligarch Roman Abramovich.\n\u201cIt was his favourite magazine, his bible,\u201d marvels Sauer. \u201cOne of our reporters went to Chelsea to interview him, and Abramovich opened a cupboard and there were all these issues of the magazine. Typical Abramovich: he just wanted to have it.\u201d\nPersonal whims such as these have created football\u2019s new order. Oil men \u2013 and not only Russians \u2013 are taking over the game. This phenomenon goes far beyond Abramovich at Chelsea. In the 1990s people thought that internet and pay-per-view television would revolutionise football. Later it was supposed to be far eastern money. Instead it has turned out to be oil.\nTwo things happened. First Russia\u2019s natural wealth was flogged off in a sort of Boxing Day sale. Next, a barrel of Brent crude soared above $60. Together, these two processes produced the richest class of global citizens in history. Free to do almost whatever they wanted with their money, they spent it on footballers. Here are some examples:\n\u25a0The Gadaffi family, which owns a stake in Juventus, is paying \u20ac240m over 10 years to advertise Libya\u2019s oil company, Tamoil, on Juve\u2019s shirts. It\u2019s the biggest shirt deal in football.\n\u25a0Alexei Fedorychev, fertiliser magnate, briefly played for Dynamo Moscow\u2019s reserves. Last year he bought Dynamo, bought several western players for the largest spending in Russian history, bought Russian football\u2019s television rights, and in August bought another club, FK Rostov. His company, Fedcom, also sponsors AS Monaco, finalists in the Champions League in 2004.\n\u25a0Kia Joorabchian, a 34-year-old British-Iranian, last year bought the Brazilian club Corinthians. He subsequently bought them the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez for $16m, the largest transfer in South American history. Joorabchian is believed to be funded by his former business contact, the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky.\n\u25a0Leonid Fedun, vice president of Russia\u2019s Lukoil, bought Spartak Moscow with other investors. Spartak have since bought their own Argentine striker, Fernando Cavenaghi,\nfor \u20ac11m.\n\u25a0Next year Arsenal move into the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium. The airline of the oil-rich United Arab Emirates is paying \u00a3100m over 15 years to brand the ground and Arsenal\u2019s shirts. This is Arsenal\u2019s only hope of keeping up with oil-fuelled Chelsea.\n\u25a0Arkady Gaidamak, an Russian-French- Israeli-Angolan billionaire, bought the Beitar Jerusalem club in August. He has yet to sign any great players.\n\u25a0The Lithuanian mini-oligarch Vladimir Romanov bought Hearts in Scotland. Romanov did sign some new players and Hearts are currently leading the Scottish league. No Scottish club other than Rangers or Celtic has won the title in 20 years.\n\u25a0Even in Angola, oil companies fund big clubs.\n\u25a0While north America\u2019s National Hockey League was on strike, some of the world\u2019s best hockey players moved to the Russian provincial towns of Omsk and Kazan. The local clubs, funded by oligarchs, can probably still match most downsized NHL franchises dollar for dollar.\n\u25a0Massimo Moratti, the Italian oil refiner, continues to bankroll Inter Milan\u2019s vain pursuit of prizes.\nThe question is why these moguls are pouring their money into bottomless holes. They certainly aren\u2019t doing it just for fun. George Orwell once remarked of Dickens\u2019s character Mr Jarndyce that nobody who had spent so much effort making his fortune would give it away so easily. It\u2019s natural to speculate that the oligarchs have some dark purpose.\nA Dutch magazine caused a stir by alleging that their clubs make up a global money-laundering network. However, this seems improbable: billionaires would scarcely bother using such a well-publicised industry to launder a few million.\nIt\u2019s possible some of them are buying a country\u2019s friendship by buying a club. Gaidamak, for whom France issued an arrest warrant, seems to believe he can safeguard his future by becoming a prominent Israeli citizen. Abramovich may have similar motives in the UK, should his old mate Vladimir Putin ever tire of him. And the Gadaffis could use Italian friendship if they squabble with the US again.\nHowever, Sauer believes the motivation is simpler. He lives in a posh suburb of Moscow, where his son plays football with Abramovich\u2019s, and after 16 years in Russia he is an anthropologist of the oligarch tribe. Sauer explains: \u201cThese people have money but they don\u2019t have status, so what do you do? You try to acquire status. In 1920s America there were tycoons who did exactly the same. They bought newspapers, went into art, that sort of thing.\n\u201cNow the Russians are all trying to get out of business. That\u2019s the big trend. Abramovich has just sold his company, Sibneft, to Gazprom. For a lot of the oligarchs, it\u2019s over. They\u2019ll lose their companies one way or another. So they\u2019re trying to get as much money out as possible and then to put it into football.\u201d This is a natural continuation of their careers: beyond your first few million, all business is a quest for status. Italy\u2019s oligarchs have long competed for status through football. Now Russia\u2019s are emulating them.\nNext May Chelsea could become the first oil-fuelled European champions. Other clubs will follow but probably not Russian ones. Russian football will probably never amount to anything, because few Russian children play football.\nSauer is chairman of the Moscow Youth Soccer League. Its problem is finding anywhere to play. Currently the league rents a couple of \u201cvery old cabbage patches\u201d from Dynamo Moscow for about $30,000 a year. Sauer said: \u201cI wrote to Abramovich, asking whether, for the millions he spends on Chelsea, he might finance a small sports field for some Muscovite children.\u201d Of course there was no reply.\n}}
{{LONDON \u2022 Mohamed Salah will be given another chance to prove that he can be a hit in the English Premier League, as he prepares to undergo a medical check-up with Liverpool today.\nLiverpool expect to complete a club-record \u00a339 million (S$69 million) deal for the Egyptian winger this week, and will pay Roma an initial fee of about \u00a335 million.\nThat matches the club-record sum they paid Newcastle United for Andy Carroll in January 2011. It will be topped up by \u00a34 million in additional payments, depending on the player's progress.\nPersonal terms are believed to have been agreed, and the 25-year-old is set to sign a four-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He will be paid about \u00a390,000 a week - double his wage in Italy.\nSigning him represents a case of second time lucky for Liverpool, who had wanted Salah in 2014 only to see him move to Chelsea instead from the Swiss club Basel.\nHe struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge, however, and in 2015 moved to Italy, joining Fiorentina on loan before moving to Roma, also on loan, soon after. That became a long-term move last August and Salah has subsequently flourished for the Giallorossi.\nIn the last Serie A season, he had 15 goals and 11 assists in 31 league appearances. Only Napoli's Jose Callejon had more assists (12), although Salah missed a month of the season as he helped Egypt reach the African Cup of Nations final.\nSalah will be looking to prove that he is a different player than the one that was limited to just 531 minutes of Premier League action with Chelsea.\nJurgen Klopp believes he can provide Liverpool with an injection of pace in their frontline, something all but absent when Senegal star Sadio Mane - the manager's only other established wide player - is unavailable.\nSalah's ability to stretch defences makes him an ideal piece in Klopp's jigsaw. With both Africans on the flanks, Klopp could employ playmaker Philippe Coutinho in a deeper role, where his vision and creativity will be maximised.\nThe Brazilian spent most of last season playing on the left side of a front three, but enjoyed one of his best performances from a deeper position in central midfield, scoring two goals and creating another in a 4-0 victory at West Ham.\nIronically, Chelsea will also benefit from Salah's move. The English champions will receive between \u00a32.3 million and \u00a32.7 million from Roma as a result of a sell-on clause when Salah left Stamford Bridge for \u00a312 million last summer.\nTHE TIMES, LONDON, THE GUARDIAN\n}}
{{The world's most addictive game returns and this time it's hell bent on adding more marriages to it's \"35 divorces\" total. Life ruiningly good and boasting new modes, clear your schedule, this one's a biggie...\nThe other day I got fired from my role at Sabotage Times. I received an email and the content of it quite simply read \"We do not want you to come back into the office anymore.\" It was an email that contained a Steam download code for Football Manager 2013. The head honchos in the office had decided that as the only single man in the office who's only notable talent is a Rain Man savant recollection of pop culture of the last decade; I had the least to lose from playing Football Manager until 3am in my lucky Superman pants, a wife beater and an eskimo hat.\nNow like a lot of fans, I am a former Football Manager addict. I used to spend days at a time holed in a room playing. I had a little notebook with transfer targets, contract details and the like. I\u2019ve made passionate speeches to my laptop promising Saints fans that Southampton will stay in the Championship. I wore football boots and shorts for my triumphant victory in the Johnstone\u2019s Paint trophy with Leyton Orient and I wore my three piece suit in the Champions League final for Newcastle where we beat Liverpool on penalties (I used to turn Newcastle into a Shakhtar Donetsk-type outfit, getting in a crop of talented young Brazilian players who battered European teams on home legs during the bleak North East winters) Between Championship Manager 01/02 to Football Manager 2007, the \u201cglorified database\u201d that is the world\u2019s most addictive game (and cited reason behind 35 divorces) consumed my life and I took it as seriously as real football.\nThen came 6th form where I went to a mixed school after 7 years of sociopath boys school living. Between trying to get girls, exams, discovering alcohol and then eventually University (were all three things were simply exacerbated), I kicked the habit. I said to myself that I couldn\u2019t play Football Manager anymore and lead a normal life. It was too addictive, too time consuming. While I admit I had the occasional relapse, I became faced with a new problem many early FM fans faced with new iterations \u2013 it had just gotten too complicated. Whereas before you could fool yourself into thinking you were only dipping your toe into the world of Football Manger, recent entries into the series made it painfully clear that this game wanted to ruin your life by sucking you into its world. So I stayed away, occasionally picking up slimmed down portable versions of Football Manger for the PSP or smartphones to get my managerial fix.\nChallenge mode drops you into a variety of different scenarios and challenges you to make a success of them.\nBut now everything has changed once more. Football Manger 2013 is here and it seems hell bent on getting back all of its former fans with \u201cClassic Mode.\u201d The Classic mode scales back a lot of the detail required of the main game, and also in turn makes it more accessible to the newcomer. I both love and hate Miles Jacobson and the rest of the Football Manger team for this; now I don\u2019t have to spend hours filtering out qualifications of prospective new coaches (a new feature of the main game) I\u2019m hooked on FM again. They may as well have named it \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship\u201d mode.\nAlso new to the PC version is \u201cChallenge Mode\u201d. First appearing on Football Manager Handheld on smartphone last year, Challenge mode drops you into a variety of different scenarios and challenges you to make a success of them. The majority last a period of half a season and you\u2019ll be tasked to do a number of things, such as go a season unbeaten, survive a mass injury crisis or avoid relegation. Some of the Challenges are a lot more interesting than others (I took Liverpool on in a \u201cInterim Manager\u201d challenge role to great success) and with further challenges in the works for download, I think it\u2019s a great new feature to the game.\nClassic mode scales back a lot of the detail required of the main game, and also in turn makes it more accessible to the newcomer.\nGetting into the main meat of the game and it\u2019s as brilliant as ever. The game looks better than ever, with an option to split screen for the multi-taskers amongst you. Your assistant manager now makes comments mid-game and continues to help out. I know he\u2019s not real, but I now love him like Clough loved Taylor. The 3D matchday engine, while still not at FIFA 13 levels is more realistic, helping make this one of the most immersive matchday experience in any sort of football game out there.\nI think the main draw of Football Manager as a game is that it creates a thoroughly believable world that works with or without your involved. Unlike most games, when you \u201close\u201d (get the sack) the game doesn\u2019t stop and mope about it \u2013 like the real world, life goes on. It teases you with its massive database, it makes you think that if you win the Champions League enough times in a row, your computer will send a message to the FA telling them you should be a candidate for the England job.\nYou thought you\u2019d kicked the habit. You thought you\u2019d found a woman and a \u201cproper\u201d hobby in Bank Holiday trips to Ikea. But like bumping into an old flame that\u2019s somehow how hotter and more intelligent than ever, yet less high maintenance, your mistress Football Manager is back. I\u2019m not going back into the Sabotage Times office for a long time. I\u2019ve got back to back promotions to gain with Stockport....\nYou can follow Carl Anka on Twitter @Bubblegum616\nIf you liked this, you\u2019ll love these\nFootball Manager Dev Miles Jacobson Reveals Why It's So Addictive\nLeading Manchester City To European Glory And My Finest Football Manager Moments\nClick here for more Hardware stories\nClick here for more stories on Football and Sport\nClick here to follow Sabotage Times on Twitter\nClick here to follow Sabotage Times on Facebook\n}}

{{OK, what to do for an encore?\nA year ago at this time, the Edison High football team was not only preparing for the 2012 season but, like its five Sunset League rivals, was gearing up for its maiden year as a competing member of the CIF Southern Section Southwest Division.\nWith a talent-packed team a year ago, Edison went on to run the table in both the Sunset League and Southwest Division and won two championships in the process. The Sunset crown marked the seventh time in the last eight years the Chargers have either won or shared the title, and the Southern Section championship was the school's first since a co-title in 1985.\nOn the final day of November of last year, Edison went to Angel Stadium and defeated Villa Park to capture the Southwest Division title. The Chargers also received an invitation to play in the CIF Division II State Regional Championship game, where they fell to eventual Division II state champion Gardena Serra.\nComing off a championship season would be a big boost to any football program. But it's a new fall, and Chargers Coach Dave White, who starts his 28th year at his alma mater, has his focus squarely on the coming season.\n\"Winning the CIF championship last year was quite a thrill and well deserved by that talented and hard-working team,\" said White, who won a Southern Section title for the first time in his fourth trip to a section final. \"It created quite a buzz on campus and with all the alumni.\n\"This past season I will cherish forever but now it is time to focus on this team and all our goals.\"\nGraduation took a toll on the Chargers. Gone from last year's team are 12 All-Sunset League players including the league's MVP (DE Derek Baljeu), defensive player of the year (LB Alejandro Perez), one of its two offensive backs of the Year (QB Alek Torgersen), defensive player of the year (DB Dylan Luther), one of its two offensive linemen of the year (OT Miah Frosh), and one of its two defensive linemen of the year (DE Trenton Aschoff).\nBack, though, are six other all-league players including first team all-league and All-CIF player Tico Fuga (OG/DT) and Jesse Sosebee, a first team all-league offensive tackle. Fuga and Sosebee recently committed to BYU and Boise St., respectively.\nSenior Christian Heffelman and junior Matt Gane have shared, and continue to share, reps at quarterback. Senior Markus Boyer makes the switch this year from tight end to center, and Jake Favreau, who had 20 receptions as a sophomore last year, is a key receiver.\nWhite says the starting spot at quarterback is still open.\n\"Our team has worked extremely hard this offseason but we are very inexperienced at linebacker and quarterback,\" he said. \"Christian [Heffelman] and Matt [Gane] have competed all summer, and they are quite even.

Fifteen straight, a million straight, whatever.\nStill, you\u2019d rather be UVA heading into Year 4 of Bronco Mendenhall than Virginia Tech heading into Year 4 of Justin Fuente, with the writers asking every presser about the offensive coordinator\u2019s continued employment, with Bud Foster getting his own presser to talk about his defense that gives up 30 points and 430 yards a game.\nThen, you look across the landscape, first at North Carolina. They\u2019re the Bad in The Good, The Bad & The Ugly T-shirts they used to sell at Mincer\u2019s back in the day.\n(The Ugly? That one\u2019s obvious.)\nCarolina fired, and rightfully so, Larry Fedora, who you could explain away by saying, injuries, but, injuries or not, back-to-back nine-loss seasons are unacceptable, and 45-43 in seven seasons is not going to get the job done.\nSo, what does UNC do to get things moving in the right direction? They reach back 20 years and try to make like Mack Brown never left.\nNow, the Mack Brown Era, that was an Era of Good Feelings in Chapel Hill. Carolina won 10 games in each of his last two seasons, 1996 and 1997, and he\u2019d have had 11 in \u201996 if he\u2019d just kicked a field goal up 17-3 in the fourth in Scott Stadium, as we all remember.\nThen Brown left for Texas, won a natty in 2005, averaged 11 wins a year for a nine-year stretch from 2001-2009, before \u2026 the game seemed to pass him by.\nHis last four years, 2010-2013, played out like the endgames for Bobby Bowden and Frank Beamer, with Texas going 30-21 over that closing stretch, before he announced his, ahem, retirement.\nThat was five years ago, five years of not particularly insightful color and studio commentary for ESPN, that wouldn\u2019t make you think he\u2019d necessarily picked up much from meeting weekly with coaches to get information about their game planning ahead of broadcasts.\nWhen his name first came up as a possibility for the UNC job, my thinking was, this is a writer looking to get clicks for a story, right? No way Carolina is actually thinking Mack Brown.\nThen he gets the job, and I\u2019m trying to rationalize. OK, so, I get it, if he hires a young coordinator or two, maybe they name one of them the coach-in-waiting, so Mack is there to jumpstart recruiting, get things moving in the right direction, then hands things off to the heir apparent.\nThat may still be happening, but all we really know right now is that he had been planning on recycling Greg Robinson to be his defensive coordinator, before wisely reconsidering that move.\nHowever things turn out with all that, Carolina Football is very much behind the eight-ball right now, which, since UNC is a Coastal Division rival, good for UVA.\nAlso good for UVA: Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson\u2019s surprising retirement. I agree with my colleague, Scott German, who said on our podcast on Monday that it\u2019s not surprising that Johnson is leaving, because he\u2019d been on the hot seat seemingly forever, and Georgia Tech had been stagnant in recent years, going just 24-24 since 2015, for instance.\nI still call it surprising, though, that Johnson is going, because of the fact that we\u2019re now a week into the post-Paul Johnson Era, and Tech doesn\u2019t yet have a coach in place.\nThe leader in the clubhouse seems to be Los Angeles Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt, whose college coaching experience consists of two seasons, way back in 1995-1996, as a position coach at Vanderbilt.\nHire him, and he has to learn on the job, after 20 years-plus in the NFL, how to put together a staff that recruits high-school kids.\nApparently, the job has been offered to Whisenhunt, and Georgia Tech is waiting on him to decide. Should he take the job, presumably, then, he\u2019s head coach at Tech part time while he finishes out his season with the Chargers, who look to make a deep run in this year\u2019s NFL playoffs.\nWhich is significant in the context of what the biggest priority will be at Georgia Tech: overhauling the offense.\nWhen you make the call to hire a guy like Paul Johnson who runs a gimmick offense, the problem you face on the back end is building your way out of said gimmick offense. For Whisenhunt, or whoever ultimately takes over at Georgia Tech, you inherit a solid defense, ranked fourth in the ACC in total defense in 2018, but on offense, you have quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers and linemen recruited and trained to run a triple-option.\nAnd how the triple-option translates to whatever your new coach decides he wants to run \u2013 be it pro-style, some sort of spread \u2013 is, well, it doesn\u2019t translate.\nYou\u2019re going to be trying to fit square pegs into innumerable round holes for at least next year, and if you\u2019re not able to get recruiting started ASAP, probably into Year 2 as well.\nThis isn\u2019t a rebuild; you\u2019re starting over with new floor plans before you can even break ground.\nGood luck with all that, Georgia Tech, and, with the Jackets being another Coastal rival, good for UVA.\nFinal good news for UVA: the dumpster fire that is Louisville, which the ACC has assigned as UVA\u2019s annual cross-division opponent.\nDumpster fire might be putting it mildly. Here\u2019s how bad things have to be: Jeff Brohm, born and raised in Louisville, played quarterback at Louisville, coached there, was the obvious next guy after Louisville fired Bobby Petrino, and could tap on the shoulder of Brohm, who is two years into turning around Purdue, after a nice run at Western Kentucky.\nIt\u2019s the kind of offer that you only get to turn down once: your dream job, where you grew up, where you played, where you coached.\nAnd Brohm turned it down.\nAnd so Louisville moved on to its second choice, and I like the guy they ended up with, Scott Satterfield, an App State alum who put up a 51-24 record in six seasons at his alma mater, including a 10-2 mark in 2018.\nIt won\u2019t be easy to get things turned around at his new job. Louisville is two seasons removed from a November swoon that dropped the Cardinals out of the playoff discussion, but, damn, this year\u2019s team stunk on ice, and it didn\u2019t seem like there was a lot in the cupboard.\nFor UVA, we play \u2018em every year, so, good for UVA.\nAll of that, plus the mess at Virginia Tech, and you have to like where the guys in orange and blue are heading into 2019 and beyond.\nI\u2019d say, as long as we don\u2019t screw this up, we should be good for a while.\nI hesitate to say that, though, because I just feel like we\u2019re about to, you know, screw things up, but you know that if you read my column yesterday.\nColumn by Chris Graham\nLike this: Like Loading...\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n}}

{{UCLA is in the midst of a revival under head coach Jim Mora, who in three seasons has finally maximized and reinvigorated a roster that underperformed under Rick Neuheisel.\nBut with quarterback Brett Hundley and a handful of other teammates headed to the NFL, the Bruins have work to do this offseason to make sure there\u2019s no drop-off in 2015. Here\u2019s a look at the seniors that are leaving UCLA, the players that declared early, and the ones that are still in Westwood.\nWho\u2019s done?\nLinebacker Eric Kendricks \u2011 The three-year starter was underappreciated for most of his UCLA career, despite leading the country in solo tackles twice. He finally seized the spotlight in 2014, winning the Butkus Award as the top linebacker in college football despite somehow being left off the All-Pac-12 first team. Kendricks is a bit undersized for the next level, but his instincts and savvy play formed the heart of the Bruins\u2019 defense on the way to a second consecutive 10-win season.\nDefensive end Owamagbe Odighizuwa \u2011 Perhaps the 6-foot-3, 270-pound lineman wasn\u2019t as dominant as some may have hoped in his final season, but he still bounced back from multiple hip surgeries to rack up 11.5 tackles for loss, six sacks and five pass breakups.\nOdighizuwa was arguably the team\u2019s most impressive physical specimen, and had moments this season where he simply outclassed any opposing blockers.\nDefensive back Anthony Jefferson \u2011 After losing the first half of his career to back and foot injuries, Jefferson spent the second becoming the most versatile member of UCLA\u2019s secondary. Capable of playing both safety and corner, he finished third on the team with 72 tackles, and tied for the team lead with eight pass breakups.\nRunning back Jordon James \u2011 James opened the last two seasons at the top of the backfield depth chart, but was quickly overshadowed this year by the emergence of redshirt sophomore Paul Perkins. Perkins became the Pac-12 rushing leader with 1,575 yards, the second-highest single-season total in UCLA history. James ran for 239 and a touchdown as a senior.\nOffensive lineman Malcolm Bunche \u2011 A graduate transfer from Miami, Bunche started the season at left tackle but was eventually moved to left guard, and then benched entirely. He did not travel with UCLA to the Alamo Bowl due to academics.\nWho\u2019s leaving early?\nQuarterback Brett Hundley \u2011 The biggest question UCLA must answer in 2015 is how it will replace \u201cThe Savior.\u201d\nHundley arrived on campus anointed as the player who would finally resuscitate a program that had become a conference afterthought. And after a redshirt year, that\u2019s exactly what he did, leading UCLA to 29 wins over three years and setting numerous personal records in the process.\nBesides Hundley, the Bruins\u2019 offense returns essentially every significant piece. Now, they just need someone new to lead.\nDefensive lineman Ellis McCarthy \u2011 This was UCLA\u2019s only unexpected loss, and it was a shocker. McCarthy was a five-star recruit in 2012, but started just eight games as a Bruin. None of those starts came this past season, where he was relegated to a reserve role behind sophomores Kenny Clark and Eddie Vanderdoes. McCarthy struggled with knee injuries and weight issues during his career, and likely could have used another year to try and boost his NFL stock.\nWho\u2019s staying?\nReceiver Jordan Payton \u2011 A report surfaced late last year that Payton was declaring for the NFL draft, but both he and Mora said that had never been a serious consideration. His return gives UCLA\u2019s new quarterback a receiver who notched 954 yards and seven touchdown catches \u2011 and one who excels at breaking tackles and blocking downfield.\nCenter Jake Brendel \u2011 The Bruins\u2019 most experienced offensive lineman requested an NFL draft evaluation, but said he is definitely coming back for his senior season. Brendel anchors a unit that finally has significant experience at all five starting spots. Besides the 2014 season opener at Virginia he missed due to a knee injury, Brendel started every single game through the past three seasons.\nWho\u2019s on the way?\nQuarterback Josh Rosen \u2011 After UCLA\u2019s Alamo Bowl win over Kansas State, Payton said, \u201cWhoever starts next year, whoever that is, they walk in with the keys to a Ferrari. They walk into an offense that, all it needs is a driver.\u201d\nThat person will likely be five-star prospect Josh Rosen, who has already enrolled at UCLA as the top-ranked quarterback in the class of 2015. With Hundley off to the NFL, the former St. John Bosco star will have every chance to win the starting job behind center \u2011 where his biggest competition will likely be backup quarterback Jerry Neuheisel, the sparkplug to UCLA\u2019s nonconference win over Texas.\nBut as well as Neuheisel did at AT&T Stadium back in September, he is not as talented as Rosen, who was chosen Player of the Year by the Long Beach Press-Telegram. If the Bruins want to hit double-digit wins for the third consecutive season, they\u2019ll need Rosen to live up to the hype.\n}}

Yarber\u2019s first two touchdowns, Cajon\u2019s first two scores, made a difference when there was a difference to be made. But his third one validated that nickname. Again, Yarber disappeared into the line, popped out 5 yards on the other side, then bounced off \u201ctwo or three guys\u201d on his 16-yard jaunt to the end zone.\n\u201cWe have so many guys on the edge you hear about on our passing attack, but Joseph is one of the most consistent players we have,\u201d Cajon coach Nick Rogers said. \u201cHe gets us yardage, he finds the end zone and he runs hard every time he has the ball.\u201d\nThis is why Yarber is so hard to deal with when he does get the ball. Teams tend to not pay a lot of attention on the little guy in the backfield. And Yarber is good with that.\n\u201cPeople look at me as they said last week, that tailback is undervalued. But with this group of guys, I\u2019ve never had this type of team chemistry in any sport I played or any gathering of guys I played with,\u201d he said.\n}}
{{Yes, it's \"jump to conclusions\" time around the sport. Time to assess some plausible knee-jerk reactions before September's midpoint arrives.\nHerm Edwards already has it going at Arizona State.\nSettle down a bit. The Sun Devils (2-0) deserve credit for out-Michigan Stating Michigan State in their 16-13 victory Saturday, a truly impressive feat against a program known for thriving in low-scoring games. And Arizona State's run defense is off to a stellar start, which is always a welcome sign. At the same time, it's merely two games. Let's see how things go with trips to San Diego State and Washington up next.\nMichigan State was overhyped.\nWith the Arizona State loss (which included a squandered 13-3 lead in the fourth quarter) and a sluggish opener against Utah State, the inclination is to say this is probably true. The Spartans will still probably end up with eight or nine wins, though.\nDan Mullen is doomed at Florida.\nCome on, the man won consistently at Mississippi State, which was no easy task in a stretch when three schools in the SEC West (Alabama, Auburn and Louisiana State) played for national titles. There was nothing good coming from losing to Kentucky for the first time since 1986, but it was always going to take time to fix things in Gainesville.\nWillie Taggart is doomed at Florida State.\nThe Seminoles' gift for getting in their own way at Samford wasn't a great look. Also, in a sentence never uttered before, Florida State's vulnerable defense is going to get a serious test at Syracuse on Saturday. But much like predecessor Jimbo Fisher, Taggart has to fix an offensive line that's been erratic for a few years now. Solve that (and it probably won't happen this year), and the Seminoles could be a top-10 team again pretty quickly.\nKevin Sumlin is doomed at Arizona.\nThis might actually be true. At the very least, the Wildcats' lifeless 0-2 start and the ineffectiveness of quarterback Khalil Tate haven't done Sumlin any favors in his new job - especially with Edwards creating excitement elsewhere in the state.\nScott Frost's honeymoon at Nebraska is over.\nNot in the slightest. After years of four-loss seasons with a scowling coach followed by a lack of traction in three seasons under one of the sport's nicest people, Frost arrived in Lincoln with the benefit of (a) being a Nebraska alum and (b) leading Central Florida to an undefeated season just last year.\nThe Cornhuskers let one get away last weekend against Colorado, no question. But Nebraska wasn't going to leap to the top of the Big Ten West this year. Besides, it could be worse. . . .\nPurdue's not taking another leap forward this season.\nIf the Boilermakers keep turning over the ball, it definitely isn't happening. They are minus-4 in that category (tied for 121st nationally) after losses to Northwestern (understandable) and Eastern Michigan (less so), and the back half of their season-opening four-game homestand (against Missouri and Boston College) isn't forgiving. Other troubling early rankings: Just 109th in red zone offense and 119th in fewest penalty yards per game.\nTexas is stuck in neutral.\nOne quick look at the Longhorns' numbers reveals they're not exceptional at much - tied for 22nd in red zone defense, 29th in third-down conversion defense. They lost a winnable opener against Maryland, then plodded through a defeat of Tulsa. A final determination on Texas will come sooner than other teams; it will face Southern Cal, TCU, Kansas State and Oklahoma over the next four weeks.\nKellen Mond is for real.\nSure seems that way, doesn't it? The Texas A&M sophomore threw for 430 yards and three touchdowns in last week's 28-26 loss to Clemson. As a point of comparison, here's the full list of quarterbacks before Mond who throw for 350 yards against Clemson since defensive coordinator Brent Venables arrived in 2012\nThose are three pretty good college quarterbacks. Throw in new Aggies Coach Jimbo Fisher's history of developing quarterbacks, and things look good for Mond moving forward.\nChad Morris needs some time at Arkansas.\nAffirmative, but that seemed obvious even before the season, let alone before last week's loss at Colorado State. Whether he needs time or not, a three-game stretch against Auburn, Texas A&M and Alabama looms starting Sept. 22, and it probably won't be fun for the Razorbacks.\n}}
{{Last week's collective groan from Provo wasn't an echo from football season. It stemmed from a new source of underachievement, this time courtesy of the BYU men's basketball team.\nThe Cougars, predicted by many to round out a three-team power in the West Coast Conference, dropped ugly back-to-back games to San Diego and cellar-dweller San Francisco. For fans and national pundits alike, the defeats seemingly put BYU directly on course for the NIT, a destination even less appealing to Cougar fans than the Poinsettia Bowl.\nFootball and basketball share more in common than a let-down present, however. The future looks brighter for both programs, thanks to the respective presence of young and explosive offensive players.\nFor football, it's all about Jamaal Williams (on offense, anyway). As a 17-year-old, the freshman running back finished with over 1,000 yards of total offense, including 775 yards rushing, averaging 4.7 yards per carry. Twelve of his 13 touchdowns came on the ground, including seven over the final five games.\nWilliams' sooner-than-expected production produced an immediate fan following starving for a grade-A star in a C-minus season. The Cougars finished 8-5, making fans only too eager to look forward.\nThe scene isn't much different just up University Parkway. BYU basketball is 19-8 with only four games left in the regular season, putting Dave Rose's six-year streak of at least 25 wins (and the subsequent NCAA Tournament berths) in serious jeopardy.\nMuch as they did with football, BYU fans are snagging what optimism they can by clinging to individual success as long as the team's is lacking.\nSophomore forward Tyler Haws has become the feel-good story both locally and on national circuits. Less than a year back from an LDS mission in the Philippines, Haws is leading the WCC in points per game (21.0) on 48.2 percent shooting.\nToss in his 4.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.5 steals per contest, and it's easy to see why imagining how good Haws could be is a lot more appealing than how good the Cougars are right now as a whole.\nHaws will look to provide more wins along with optimism tonight against Utah State, who he hasn't played since Dec. 2, 2009. The Cougars lost that game 71-61, then their first loss of the season.\n}}
{{AP\nRobert Kraft bought the Patriots 20 years ago. During two wildly successful decades (both on the field and financially), Kraft has noticed one significant change to the culture that has helped football become as popular as it now is.\nWith technological advances creating more isolation, football creates a true sense of togetherness.\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happened in America, but pretty much the Western world, is people are wedded to their smartphones and their iPads, and they\u2019re texting and they\u2019re not connecting with one another,\u201d Kraft told Bil Littlefield of 99.9 WBUR\u2019s Only A Game. \u201cWhen 70,000 people come to our stadium on a Sunday, they\u2019re all about the team on the field, and I think everybody has a sense of community in supporting these teams.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon that extends well beyond stadiums.\n\u201cIt was amazing to me: this past weekend we had the [NFL] draft, and almost 50 million people watched the draft, double the ratings of the NBA [playoffs], triple of the hockey [playoffs], and this is a draft, that\u2019s passive,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just because people are into \u2014 they play fantasy football with their kids, and they\u2019re just into what we try to create and integrate into community.\u201d\nWhile he never may have seen it coming in 1994, the NFL remains one of the few, if not only, products that can unite a multi-million-person audience in real time. Every other popular form of entertainment can be consumed at many, or any, specific hour or day. Live NFL football happens in the now, and that\u2019s when the vast majority of the audience take it in.\nAs technology continues to provide more and more options for the individual, the NFL will continue to be the thing that is defined by the collective. Which means that it won\u2019t be disappearing any time soon.\n}}
{{SOUTHEAST GLENDALE\u2014 In its previous game, the quarterback position was an afterthought for the Burroughs High football team, as it didn\u2019t attempt a pass in the second half.\nBut quarterback Andrew Williams was back on the field for the Indians in Thursday night\u2019s Pacific League game against host Crescenta Valley at Moyse Field and left a deep imprint on the game.\nWilliams managed an effective offensive effort for Burroughs and altered the game with a pair of huge runs after being flushed out of the pocket in the fourth quarter to preserve a 20-16 win, the team\u2019s second in a row.\n\u201cI trust my O-line with all my heart, but what [CV] did was try to trip us up by bringing many guys on the outside and the kind of offense we are, we like to roll out and I have the ability to run and that was just ineffective to [stopping] what I can do,\u201d said Williams (15 for 21 passing for 143 yards and 110 yards rushing in four carries). \u201cMy O-line, I\u2019m really proud of them today, they got it done, but you\u2019ve got to make big plays in games like this to win.\u201d\nWilliams did just that, starting with an 89-yard run away from pressure in the backfield with the Indians pinned back at their own nine-yard line on third and long with 11:43 left in the fourth quarter. The ensuing one-yard score on an option pitch from Williams to Garrett Manoukian put the Indians up, 20-0. After Crescenta Valley answered with its first touchdown of the night on a 36-yard run by William Wang (92 yards rushing in 15 carries) to cap a 71-yard drive with 7:13 to play, Williams against scrambled for a 32-yard gain on third and nine from the Burroughs 36-yard line to keep an Indians drive alive. Although Burroughs wouldn\u2019t get points on the drive, the extra minutes run off the clock and improved field position on an ensuing punt from the Falcons\u2019 35 were crucial in holding off Crescenta Valley\u2019s comeback.\n\u201cTo be honest, I should have scored on both of those plays,\u201d Williams said.\nCrescenta Valley\u2019s offense was stagnant through the first three quarters, racking up just 103 total yards, with fumbling issues wrecking any semblance of momentum. The Falcons lost two fumbles in the first half and mishandled two more snap exchanges in one third quarter drive for a loss of 14 total yards, forcing a punt. The Indians scored a touchdown on a two-yard run by Israel Montes (107 yards rushing and two touchdowns in 17 carries) to go up, 13-0, on the ensuing possession.\n\u201cWe were a little bit off in that,\u201d Crescenta Valley Coach Paul Schilling said. \u201cThe funny thing is [the Indians] have been doing that in all their games. They figured it out and then we caught the disease of not getting the snap down.\u201d\nBurroughs played its own worst enemy at times, too, committing 10 penalties for 105 yards, including consecutive pass interference calls on the Falcons\u2019 final scoring drive, that saw quarterback Joe Torres move the ball 80 yards to pull within 20-14 on a 12-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Tavizon with six seconds left.\nBut the Falcons\u2019 mistakes proved to be costlier, especially a Tavizon fumble at the end of run with 5:03 left in the first quarter that gave the Indians the ball at midfield an set up a scoring drive for the Indians culminating in Montes\u2019 25-yard burst up the middle for a 7-0 lead with 2:39 in the first.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the play of the game,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cThat was a huge play because that was the only touchdown [in the first half]. We were playing great defense. ...That sort of let the wind out.\u201d\nTorres (eight for 17 for 89 yards) also lost a fumble while being sacked with 38 seconds left in the second quarter. Burroughs\u2019 Jason Hamm recovered the ball at the CV 43, but the Falcons caught a break when a 39-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left to end the half..\n\u201cEvery game this is how our season\u2019s gone,\u201d said Schilling, whose team was coming off a win over Pasadena. \u201cWe play a good game and then we come back all confident and we don\u2019t do what we\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n}}
{{Share:\nLONDON - The debate over the damage inflicted by heading a football took another turn on Wednesday as a leading expert in brain injuries said children under the age of 18 should not be allowed to.\nDoctor Bennett Omalu, who was the first specialist to discover how American footballers were affected by the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), told the BBC he realised his remarks might jar with some people but that society was evolving.\n\"No child under the age of 18 should be heading the ball in soccer,\" said the 49-year-old Nigeria-born naturalised American. \"Kids under the age of 12 to 14 should play a less contact form of soccer which we should develop for them.\n\"Kids between 12 and 18 can play but should not head the ball. \"I know this is difficult for many people but science evolves. We change with time. Society changes. It is time for us to change some of our ways.\"\nOmalu, whose discovery of the impact of CTE on NFL players arose from his autopsy of former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster in 2002, said heading a football was dangerous and that it should be restricted even at professional level.\n\"It does not make sense to control an object travelling at a high velocity with your head,\" he said.\n\"I believe, eventually, at the professional level we need to restrict heading of the ball. It is dangerous.\"\nThe side effects of heading has been a burning issue since an inquest into the death of former England and West Brom striker Jeff Astle ruled he died from brain trauma caused by heading old heavy leather footballs.\nHe died in 2004, aged 72, after suffering with Alzheimer's for almost 10 years following his 16-year football career.\nA second former professional player, Rod Taylor, was also recently diagnosed with a similar form of dementia linked to heading the ball, after his family donated his brain to scientists for analysis following his death aged 74 earlier this year.\nSeveral other high profile footballers - including a trio of England's 1966 World Cup winning team in Martin Peters, Nobby Stiles and the late Ray Wilson - have also been diagnosed with dementia.\n\"The human brain floats like a balloon inside your skull so when you head the ball you suffer brain damage,\" said Omalu.\n\"You damage your brain when you head the ball.\n\"Playing soccer would increase your risk of suffering brain damage when you are much older and developing dementia and CTE.\"\n}}
{{Just two weeks after forfeiting to Taft, Young officially canceled its football season because of a dwindling roster caused by injuries and academic struggles.\nYoung principal Dr. Joyce Kenner confirmed the decision Tuesday, adding that she spoke with the players before making the announcement on the school intercom at the end of the day Monday.\nKenner said most of the players agreed with her decision.\n\u201cObviously, there were some sad faces, but I know everyone agreed this was the right decision to do for this school,\u201d Kenner said.\nCoach Tim Franken said the decision didn\u2019t surprise him.\n\u201cOur numbers have been low since last spring,\u201d said Franken, who has been coaching football at Young for 24 years and has never seen the participation numbers this low. \u201cMost of the players are underclassmen, sophomores and freshmen. I could just see it was very difficult for our young team to compete against teams coming up, and there was a concern for their safety.\u201d\nFranken hinted that the lack of interest in playing football could stem from the sport\u2019s concussion controversy or the school\u2019s wide variety of varsity sports.\nBut the decision ultimately came down to the team\u2019s inability to compete with a short-handed roster.\nChicago Public Schools mandate that teams need at least 22 players to play, but the Dolphins have only 19 active players.\nThe football program started the season with 26 players, but seven became ineligible to play. Four players are out with injuries \u2014 most of which were suffered in Week 3 against Goode \u2014 and three others couldn\u2019t maintain academic eligibility.\nKenner said students won\u2019t be able to participate in athletic events if they have multiple failing assignments in a class in a week.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t tolerate that,\u201d Kenner said. \u201cAcademics are a priority. And if they can\u2019t compete in the classroom, they can\u2019t compete on the playing field or have that opportunity to play on the field.\u201d\nThe football season was canceled just days before Young\u2019s homecoming game. The school now will celebrate homecoming at the boys\u2019 soccer game against Curie at 4:15 p.m. Thursday. The five senior football players will be honored on the field before the game, and the team will participate in the school\u2019s pep rally.\nKenner said Young will look to rebuild its program but wouldn\u2019t detail how the school might go about it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to bring football back next school year,\u201d Kenner said.\nFranken, the chairman of Young\u2019s physical-education department, also is confident in the program\u2019s future.\n\u201cA few years ago, we\u2019re 9-0 and in the state playoffs, and in a short time this dropped,\u201d Franken said. \u201cThe encouraging thing is, we have freshmen and sophomores that are skilled and want to play, and that molds well for me for the future of the program.\u201d\nYoung was 0-5 this season and coming off a 72-0 loss to Simeon on Friday.

The 2016 season was going to be the one where the Seminoles played for a chance to win the fourth national title in program history. With all three of you (likely) heading to the pros after this season, this was going to be the shining moment for the three of you \u2013 getting your first ring (second for DeMarcus) and cementing your legacy.\nArticle continues below ...\nInstead, the three of you are likely going to spend your final time in a FSU football uniform playing in the Russell Athletic Bowl, the Belk Bowl or maybe even the Sun Bowl. You\u2019re going to go down as being a part of a team that was the most underachieving one in program history after all the expectations entering the year.\nIt has nothing to do with you guys. All three of you have done your job most of the season. Dalvin, you have found your form after a slow start and have been quite possibly the best player in college football over the last six weeks of the season.\nDeMarcus, you started off the year with guns blazing against Ole Miss. Your 4.5 sacks against the Rebels made the nation take notice and you\u2019ve been the unquestioned leader of a defense that has not played up to your level.\nTravis, you have been the most reliable receivers this season, helping to give Deondre Francois a safety blanket in the passing game \u2013 as well as being a class act off the field who made us all proud to be fans or alumni of Florida State.\nSo, on behalf of those who have watched you during your careers in Tallahassee, we\u2019re sorry.\nWe\u2019re sorry that your last times in garnet and gold are being spent with other players and coaches who, on the surface, don\u2019t play with the same heart you three do. There is no question that the talent is there, but the execution is a different story \u2013 and all of you deserve better.\nYou deserve to be playing in Orlando during the first week of December to win the ACC title for the fourth time in the last five seasons. You deserve to be playing in either the Peach or Fiesta Bowl on New Year\u2019s Eve and then, 10 days later, making a return trip to Tampa to play for the national title.\nHell, at the worst, you deserve to be in the Orange Bowl on December 30th \u2013 bringing home another big bowl win that would be even more special for the two of you from South Florida.\nPlease don\u2019t be mad and turn your back on the program. The three of you will go down as some of the best to ever play for the Seminoles \u2013 and we will always be thankful for what the three of you meant to FSU football.\nThis article originally appeared on\n}}

{{Oregon Ducks Benefactor Phil Knight has spoken and he believes it may be time for a Coaching Change.\nThe Oregon Ducks may not be competing in a Bowl Game this season. It is a far cry from where they were just two seasons ago. The Ducks have lost six of their last seven games with what was a Heisman Candidate at Running Back, but the team is in a rebuilding year, and a Defensive year that has players playing out of position in the new 4-3 Defensive Scheme. According to one member of the media, the above may not be enough to save the Coaching Staff.\nESPN Business Reporter Darren Rovell sent out a tweet before halftime on Saturday when the Oregon Ducks were flailing against USC that could spell out the future of the Oregon Coaching Staff and it\u2019s not good.

He has even spent time with Chip Kelly in recent weeks and according to Rovell is set to make someone very happy and very well paid to come in and \u2018fix\u2019 the Ducks. Honestly, with the switch to the 4-3 Defense it is recruiting that will make the biggest difference, but the double-edged sword is that Oregon has already lost it\u2019s luster. The team is reeling and signing a big name Coach may be the only thing to save the Ducks even though it may take a few seasons for the team to return as a Contender in the Pac-12.\nOregon needs to win their final three games of the year to become Bowl Eligible. After the game against USC I\u2019m not sure three wins are in the cards for this team the rest of the way. The talent is definitely there as is the will to win, but the rest of the Pac-12 has caught up to the Oregon Ducks. The team needs to find a way to innovate.

{{The first workout in pads during training camp usually belongs to the defense, but Los Angeles Chargers center Mike Pouncey was ready to bring his own level of physicality.\nPouncey traded blows with Chargers defensive linemen Brandon Mebane and Corey Liuget on Monday, showing a ferocity he rediscovered because of how his time in Miami ended after seven seasons.\n\"It just lit that fire again in me,\" Pouncey said. \"I never thought I would play with anybody but the Dolphins, but once they released me, it made me want to be an even better football player. It made me want to prove everybody wrong, and I'm excited to be here. I can't wait to help this run game out, help this football team do something special.\"\nPouncey signed a two-year contract with the Chargers in March, inspired by the chance to play with one of the game's top quarterbacks in Philip Rivers.\nHis time in Miami saw Pouncey working with a host of journeymen before helping first-round draft pick Ryan Tannehill transition to the NFL. Rivers is at the other end of the spectrum in terms of talent, experience and understanding of the game. It didn't take long for Pouncey to recognize Rivers' comprehensive mastery of the position.\n\"I just like that he knows everything that is going on each and every play. When we go up, he's the guy that points out the Mike (linebacker). He knows when blitzes are coming, so he puts us in the right protections and he gets us in and out of plays. When a bad look is there and we don't want to run that play, he switches the play,\" Pouncey said.\n\"To be able to play with him, I don't take it for granted. I feel like it's something that I lucked up into, and I'm going to take full advantage of it.\"\nThe chance to play on a team with viable Super Bowl aspirations was just as important for Pouncey, who reached the playoffs once during his time with the Dolphins, as the Chargers are the only team in the AFC West that returns its head coach, both coordinators and starting quarterback. The professionalism displayed by his new teammates during their brief time together has convinced Pouncey the Chargers can deliver on their growing expectations.\n\"Every year in the league I've always wanted to win,\" Pouncey said. \"That's the goal every year you go into training camp is to try and win something, win the Super Bowl.

Being both a student and an athlete is probably the most difficult thing most of us have ever done.\" -- Evan Vance, Rockwall long snapper\n\"What I want people to know about high school football is that it's about so much more than Friday nights and letter jackets. For our team high school football is also about learning the proper life lessons, being a family, giving back to the community, and being good role models for the young kids in the community. While we are very focused on refining our game on the field to yield the best results on Friday night, we also understand that there is so much more to life than football and we are always looking to improve in all aspects off of the field as well.\" -- Blake Watson, Flower Mound Marcus linebacker\n* * *\nFinally, here's a great email response I received from Keller Fossil Ridge graduate Tate Hawkins, who played outside linebacker and safety for Fossil Ridge. Hawkins graduated in the spring and now attends Mississippi.\n\"I was never the star of my team. In two seasons on the varsity squad, I never started a game. I played alongside guys who now play on scholarship at colleges such as Harvard, TCU, and the Air Force Academy while I'm a self-proclaimed intramural star at Ole Miss. Even though I wasn't the star, my years of high school football mean so much to me. Without it, I would never have had the experiences such as playing on an icy West Texas field or playing in AT&T Stadium in the postseason. I would have never experienced team dinners or the hallowed locker room shenanigans. Above all that, the reason high school football means so much to me is what I was taught by my coaches. To them, it was more than a game, and it will always be more than a game. They did all in their power to focus more on having great men rather than great players because they knew if we were great men, we would perform at game time. One thing that was done, was during team meetings the day before a game, while most coaches would be looking for \"bulletin board material\" to tick us off before the game, they would have a life lesson prepared. My personal favorite talked about a guy who fell out of a cell tower and was completely messed up, and when he was at his lowest he had a positive attitude, all to show us that each day is what you make of it, and you can choose to have a good attitude or a bad attitude; I have that story posted in my dorm room. The biggest thing that I learned from my coaches and from high school football was that when it comes down to it, you don't have to be THE man, you just have to be A man. Thank you for the opportunity and all the lessons, friends.\"\nTwitter: @mattwixon\n}}

{{When discussing challenges, Rodney Taylor tells his wife, Dr. Shontae Taylor, \u201cIf you want to know if you\u2019re good or effective, grab something that hasn\u2019t been doing well and try to turn that around.\u201d In accepting the job as Menchville\u2019s head football coach, Taylor will test that philosophy to the extreme.\nTaylor, an assistant coach at Heritage the past nine seasons, takes over a Menchville football program mired in nearly a quarter-century of futility. The Monarchs have not finished .500 since 1996 and have won as many as four games only once in the past 22 seasons.\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Menchville doesn\u2019t have athletes walking its halls. The Monarchs have won the Peninsula District (Julian Rice) all-sports trophy 20 of those 22 years.\nTherein Taylor sees a possible solution.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to recruit the heck out of that school,\u201d Taylor said of Menchville. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to win that battle first and foremost, before heading to some of the middle schools and the boys\u2019 clubs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make it interesting and exciting for them, and just work our tails off in getting the best possible players out there.\u201d\nTaylor replaces Ray Savage, who resigned after four seasons in which the Monarchs won five games total. Taylor, 43, a counselor at the Enterprise Academy and a former assistant at Bowie (Md.) High and for the club team at George Mason University, helped with a similar rebuild at Heritage.\n\u201cComing from Heritage, when we went 0-10 (his first season as an assistant there in 2010) to heading to the state semifinals against Dinwiddie (in 2013), that was definitely a build and a turnaround,\u201d said Taylor, who, most recently, coached Heritage\u2019s linebackers and running backs. \u201cI\u2019ve been a part of that before.\n\u201cI welcome the challenge and I signed up for the challenge to do it again. Coming from where I\u2019ve been and seeing the results, I think it\u2019s Menchville\u2019s turn now.\u201d\nTaylor should inherit six starting defenders, including talented linebackers and brothers Seth Naotala and Koa Naotala. Seth Naotala should team in the offensive backfield with Geo Hales, one of best returning running backs in the district, but Taylor will have to build the lines.\nHe\u2019ll do that, and construct the rest of the program, with a keen focus on fundamentals and details.\n\u201cI tell everyone my philosophy is to pay attention to the front part of the alphabet, the A\u2019s, B\u2019s, C\u2019s and D\u2019s, and the X\u2019s and O\u2019s will take care of themselves,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf we take care of our academics, attitude, behavior, character and discipline, when we get to the back part of the alphabet, the X\u2019s and O\u2019s, we\u2019re going to be able to compete and compete really well.\u201d\nMarty O\u2019Brien, 757-247-4963, mobrien@dailypress.com Twitter @MartyOBrienDP\n}}
{{During the first week of fantasy football season, you can expect the unexpected and this year\u2019s regular season first week wasn\u2019t any different. Players who were thought to be a lock to put your team over the top fell short of expectations.\nWith that said, here are three Redskins you should start this weekend as the Burgundy and Gold head to Las Angeles to face the Rams.\nQB Kirk Cousins\nCousins didn\u2019t have a good day last week against the Philadelphia Eagles. He completed 23 of 40 pass attempts for 240 yards, one touchdown, and one interception and a pair of fumbles. He also had four rushes for 30 yards only producing 10.6 fantasy points.\nLook for coach Jay Gruden to get Cousins into a rhythm using the quick passing game. He should have a better week as they take on a Los Angeles Rams secondary that is vulnerable to the pass especially in the middle of the field. For this reason, Cousins should be in your starting lineup.\nRB Chris Thompson\nIn week one against the Eagles, Thompson only had four yards on the ground but was targeted five times in the passing game. On the day, the former Florida State standout caught four balls for 52 yards and a touchdown for a total of 17.40 fantasy points.\nHis ability to make people miss in the open field can be lethal for an overly aggressive defense in the Rams. The Redskins should use a lot of screenplays and delayed draws to neutralize the speed and athletic ability of the Rams defensive front. Thompson is a player you should start in week two.\nWR Jamison Crowder\nCrowder didn\u2019t have one of his best performances last week, bringing in three of seven targets for only 14 yards. His day as a punt returner wasn\u2019t much better either, as he only had three yards on two attempts and a costly fumble.\nWith the Rams best defensive back Trumaine Johnson likely shadowing WR Terrelle Pryor, Crowder could have a bounce-back game as the Redskins offense should look to get the ball out quickly given the struggles of the offensive line.\n}}
{{When the U.S. military aide carrying the nuclear football entered the Great Hall, Chinese security officials blocked his entry. (The official who carries the nuclear football is supposed to stay close to the president at all times, along with a doctor.)\nA U.S. official hurried into the adjoining room and told Kelly what was happening. Kelly rushed over and told the U.S. officials to keep walking \u2014 \"We're moving in,\" he said \u2014 and the Americans all started moving.\nThen there was a commotion. A Chinese security official grabbed Kelly, and Kelly shoved the man\u2019s hand off of his body. Then a U.S. Secret Service agent grabbed the Chinese security official and tackled him to the ground.\nThe whole scuffle was over in a flash, and the U.S. officials told about the incident were asked to keep quiet about it. Trump's team followed the normal security procedure to brief the Chinese before their visit to Beijing, according to a person familiar with the trip \u2014 but somebody at the Chinese end either didn't get the memo or decided to mess with the Americans anyway.\nI'm told that at no point did the Chinese have the nuclear football in their possession or even touch the briefcase. I'm also told the head of the Chinese security detail apologized to the Americans afterwards for the misunderstanding.\nUpdated with Secret Service statement:\n\u201cAn individual, not part of the official delegation, attempted to prevent one of our protectees from entering a room. A U.S. Secret Service agent quickly intervened and a short scuffle ensued. The individual complied with the agent\u2019s directions and no further action was necessary. At no time did anyone involved fall to the ground. The event continued without incident.\u201d\nFor more reporting like this, sign up here for Sneak Peek and our other Axios newsletters.\n}}
{{In an important appeal that divided Hollywood, the Third Circuit sides with the likeness rights of celebrities over protections afforded by the First Amendment. (SAG 1, MPAA 0)\nIn a ruling that some in the entertainment industry are going to love and others are going to hate, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals revived former Rutgers QB Ryan Hart's lawsuit against Electronic Arts for allegedly violating his publicity rights in the video game \"NCAA Football.\"\nHart played at Rutgers from 2002 to 2005 and objected to EA's video game which let users go into \"dynasty mode\" and control digital avatars that bore strong resemblance to real-life counterparts.\nThe case tested the balance between an individual's right to protect their likeness from commercial exploitation and an entertainment studio's right to engage in free speech. In September, 2011, a federal judge granted EA summary judgment victory, finding that EA's free expression outweighed Hart's publicity rights and that the game contained creative elements that were transformative fair use.\nThe case then went on appeal, and among those supporting EA was the Motion Picture Association of America, which submitted an amicus brief. On the other side, supporting Hart was the Screen Actors Guild. (Other amici included the professional sports leagues, A&E Television, Gawker, ESPN, The New York Times, etc.)\nOn Tuesday, the Third Circuit judges overturned by a 2-1 margin the lower court's call and remanded the case back to a trial court for further proceedings.\nThe majority opinion by Judge Joseph Greenaway Jr. accepts the fact that video games are protected as expressive free speech by the First Amendment and analyzes case law on the subject of publicity rights including the only case on the issue that has made it to the U.S. Supreme Court -- Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. (1977), which involved a man named Hugo Zacchini who performed a human cannonball act and sued after a local Ohio TV station broadcast Zacchini\u2019s entire act. (Zacchini won.)\n\"In the wake of Zacchini, courts began applying a balancing inquiry to resolve cases where a right of publicity claim collided with First Amendment protections,\" notes Judge Greenaway. \"Consequently, we now turn our attention to more standardized balancing tests to see whether any of them offer a particularly compelling methodology for resolving the case at hand and similar disputes.\"\nIn the ruling (read here in full), the appeals court ultimately settles on using the \"Transformative Use\" test, which taken from copyright precedent, generally means an analysis of the creative contributions that might transform use of a protected work into a fair use.\nJudge Greenaway also leans on other big decisions in the rights of publicity genre including one in California involving an artist who sold lithographs and T-shirts bearing the faces of the Three Stooges. That case (Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup) put the question as whether the celebrity likeness is one of the \u201craw materials\u201d from which an original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question. (It has recently come up in a lawsuit over the opening credits in the hit series, Mad Men.)\nUltimately, the appeals court judges look at the former Rutgers QB's situation and see it similarly to the way an appeal had gone for No Doubt's Gwen Stefani over a videogame from Activision.\nJudge Greenaway writes:\n\"The digital Ryan Hart does what the actual Ryan Hart did while at Rutgers: he plays college football, in digital recreations of college football stadiums, filled with all the trappings of a college football game. This is not transformative; the various digitized sights and sounds in the video game do not alter or transform the Appellant\u201fs identity in a significant way. Indeed, the lack of transformative context is even more pronounced here than in No Doubt, where members of the band could perform and sing in outer space.\"\nThe circuit judge also looks at the videogame \"users\u201f ability to alter the avatar\u201fs appearance\" but finds that it is insufficient to overcome the plaintiff's publicity rights as transformative. \"To hold, therefore, that a video game should satisfy the Transformative Use Test simply because it includes a particular interactive feature would lead to improper results. Interactivity cannot be an end onto itself.\"\nThe majority ruling even cites the amicus brief filed by SAG here that said, \"[U]nder [EA's] application of the transformative test [sic], presumably no infringement would be found if individuals such as the Dalai Lama and the Pope were placed within a violent 'shoot-em-up' game, so long as the game include[d] a 'mechanism' by which the user could manipulate their characteristics.\"\nIn perhaps the part of the 73-page ruling that will cause most concern going forward for Hollywood studio lawyers, the appeals court addresses the issue of what to do about works that contain many creative elements so as to possibly outweigh a minor portion that includes something bad. Says the ruling, \"It cannot be that content creators escape liability for a work that uses a celebrity's unaltered identity in one section but that contains a wholly fanciful creation in the other, larger section.\"\nThe case now moves forward. There are other similar fights going on, including an appeal that was just argued weeks ago at the Ninth Circuit over a lower judge's dismissal of a publicity rights claim brought by an Iraqi veteran against producers of The Hurt Locker.\nThe Hart v. Electronic Arts ruling could be appealed up to the Supreme Court.\nSaying his guild was \"very gratified\" with the ruling, SAG-AFTRA GC Duncan Crabtree-Ireland commented that the \"clear and unambiguous adoption of the transformative use test by the Court should lay the groundwork for the establishment of a consistent jurisprudence that will make resolution of these issues much easier in the future.\"\nE-mail: eriq.gardner@thr.com; Twitter: @eriqgardner\n}}
{{Malcolm Jones, a former Gatorade National Player of the Year out of Oaks Christian High, will transfer out of UCLA, according to an online published report.\nJones, a 6-foot, 220-pound running back, rushed for only 10 yards on three carries in the Bruins\u2019 49-24 victory over Rice last week.\nThe former Parade Magazine All-American has struggled in previous years to gain playing time, this season falling behind Johnathan Franklin, Jordan James and Damien Thigpen.\nThe website BruinReportOnline.com was first to report Jones\u2019 transfer.\nJones, whose transfer paperwork has not yet been filed to make it official, was the No. 8 rated running back in the nation according to ESPN.\nJones has shared minimal carries the past two seasons while also playing on special teams.

{{Saturday\nLiberty (12-1) vs. Sierra Canyon-Chatsworth (12-3) in CIF Division I-A state championship game at Cerritos College in Norwalk, 8 p.m.: Two schools with a similar style of play strap it on for a state title. This will be Liberty\u2019s first appearance in a state championship game. Sierra Canyon is here for a third time. Two years ago the Trailblazers finished a 16-0 season by beating Serra 42-40. \u201cThey are extremely multiple,\u201d Liberty coach Ryan Partridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like looking at us.\u201d In what had to be considered at least a mild upset, Sierra Canyon earned a trip to state by beating Upland 7-3 in the CIF Southern California regionals. Upland was at home and has a lineup loaded with three- and four-star recruits. Sierra Canyon starts seven sophomores and a freshman. Sierra Canyon coach Jon Ellinghouse said he expects plenty of those youngsters will become attractive recruits. This game has the potential to be a shootout. Sierra Canyon averages 37.4 points per game but allows 19.6. Six times teams have scored 25 points or more against the Trailblazers, who are 3-3 in those contests. The SoCal school runs slightly more than it passes, but the offense is pretty balanced. Sophomore quarterback Chayden Peery has passed for 2,805 yards. Leading rusher EJ Gable has run for 1,520 yards, but the Trailblazers have three more backs who have gained at least 429 yards. They have five receivers with at least 15 catches. \u201cWe have a lot of weapons,\u201d Ellinghouse said. The question is whether Sierra Canyon can stop Liberty. Junior quarterback Jay Butterfield passed for 337 yards against Valley Christian\u2019s highly touted defense last week. His receivers \u2014 Sione Vaki, Jerrin Easter-Williams, Adrik Lamar \u2014 are tough to cover. The Lions also have incorporated Cody Muth into the passing game. Tyerell Sturges-Cofer is a premier running back with two good substitutes in Brenden Bell and Darrion Bartley. The Lions will be without linebacker Nicky Einess on defense, and that\u2019s a concern. He stands 5-9, 170 but plays like he\u2019s 6-5, 225. He suffered a concussion against Valley Christian, and no matter how hard he tries, he\u2019s not going to talk his way onto the field. TV: NBC Sports California .\n\u2014 Mike Lefkow\nLincoln-San Diego (11-4) vs. Menlo-Atherton (12-2) in CIF Division 3-AA state championship game at Sequoia High, 6 p.m.: For a second time in three years, M-A gets a shot at a state title. Four-star inside linebacker Daniel Heimuli, who is considering offers from Alabama, Oregon, UCLA, Utah and Washington, along with nose guard Noa Ngalu, a Washington commit, played key roles for the Bears as sophomores in a 39-21 loss to Paraclete at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, reliving the same thing,\u201d Heimuli said. \u201cAnd some of the lessons that I learned from that year coming into this year is that any noise outside the team, it shouldn\u2019t really matter. The hype shouldn\u2019t get to us. Whatever we\u2019re doing, we need to execute.\u201d The fact M-A will need to drive fewer than five miles to Redwood City this time around is an added bonus. \u201cSequoia is like a backyard to us,\u201d Ngalu said. \u201cIt\u2019s really close and I\u2019m just happy that my whole family can actually make it to the state game, my last high school game wearing an M-A jersey.\u201d On offense, the Bears feature sophomore wide receiver Troy Franklin, the No. 1 recruit in the state for the class of 2021 according to 247Sports. He scored three touchdowns in a 27-20 victory over Eureka in last week\u2019s NorCal title game, including the game-winning score on a 70-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Lincoln, which is making its first appearance in a state final, isn\u2019t afraid to air it out in its spread offense, with a pair of dangerous wide receivers of its own in Jamahd Monroe (1,254 yds, 13 TDs) and Keyshawn Smith (945 yds, 14 TDs), while also capable of handing it off to running back Carlito Nothaft (1273 yds, 16 TDs). \u201cThey have a deep and storied tradition as a program; they\u2019ve put out a lot of college and NFL players,\u201d M-A coach Adhir Ravipati said. \u201cThis is the first time all season I think we\u2019re going to play a team that\u2019s more athletic than us, and so it\u2019s going to test us in a different way.\u201d\n\u2014 Vytas Mazeika\nKaiser-Fontana (14-1) at Wilcox (13-1) in CIF Division 3-A state championship game, 6 p.m.: This is a new experience for both teams as neither has played in a state championship game. Kaiser will bring a 13-game winning to the field. Since their only loss \u2014 9-0 to Aquinas-San Bernardino on Aug. 24 \u2014 the Cats have averaged 44.5 points per game. Wilcox has averaged 39.8 points per game. Both get it done on the ground. To say that Kaiser running back Christian Hunter is prolific would be a huge understatement. Entering Saturday\u2019s game, he has rushed for 3,635 yards and 54 touchdowns on the season. The 6-foot senior has not rushed for fewer than 127 yards in any game and has been limited to fewer than 200 yards only four times. In the Southern California 3-A final, he rushed for 324 yards in 30 carries and scored all seven of his team\u2019s touchdowns as Kaiser advanced with a 48-40 win over Eisenhower-Rialto. The Cats also have another 1,000-yard rusher, sophomore quarterback Trey Tribble (1,096 yards, eight rushing TDs). Tribble has also passed for 957 yards and 11 touchdowns. Wilcox has a pair of 1,000-yard rushers in Paul M. Rosa (1,471 yards, 19 rushing touchdowns) and Gabe Herrera (1,330 yards, 19 rushing touchdowns). Rosa has also caught a team-high 26 passes for 573 yards and eight touchdowns. Quarterback Alex Adame has passed for 1,260 yards and 20 touchdowns. He had a team-high 119 yards rushing in a regional win last week over Capital Christian-Sacramento.\n\u2014 Phil Jensen\nGarfield-Los Angeles (13-1) vs. McClymonds (11-2) in CIF Division 4-A state championship game at Laney College, 6 p.m.: McClymonds is going for a third consecutive state title after rallying to defeat Aptos 28-20 in a regional championship game last week. The Warriors traveled to the San Diego area to win the 5-A state crown in 2016, 20-17 over La Jolla Country, and to the Central Valley last season to win the 5-AA state title, 42-12 over Golden West. Saturday, Mack will travel fewer than three miles to play Garfield for the 4-A title. This is the second consecutive season that the CIF moved the Warriors to a higher classification. Mack reached this stage by breezing once again through badly overmatched Oakland Athletic League opponents, winning the six games by a combined score of 359-0. Before the onslaught, the Warriors challenged themselves in non-league play, beating Marin Catholic and San Leandro and losing to Liberty and Palo Alto. Mack finished with 399 yards against Aptos, 371 on the ground in 51 attempts. The Warriors are a big, physical team, led by running back Adi Anderson \u2014 the OAL MVP \u2014 running back/linebacker Jarmar Julien, linebacker Javanz Dornners and lineman Mark Hoching. Garfield qualified for the state playoffs as a section Open Division runner-up \u2014 something the CIF will not allow starting next season \u2014 and took advantage of the rules by beating Kennedy-Delano 42-10 to advance to the game Saturday. Peter Jason Garcia leads Garfield with 1,778 yards and 22 touchdowns rushing. Sophomore QB Jonathan Bautista has passed for 1,541 yards and 15 TDs. Garfield\u2019s only loss came in the Los Angeles Section Open Division final, 55-7 to Narbonne-Harbor City, the team that rallied from 21-0 behind to beat Pittsburg 28-21 in the Division I-A state title game last season in Sacramento.\n\u2014 Darren Sabedra\nOther games\nOpen Division state championship (Dec. 8): Mater Dei-Santa Ana 35, De La Salle 21\nDivision 1-AA state championship: Folsom (13-1) vs. Cathedral Catholic-San Diego (12-1), at Cerritos College, Norwalk, Friday, 8 p.m., NBC Sports California\nDivision 2-AA state championship: Del Oro-Loomis (13-1) vs. Grace Brethren-Simi Valley (13-2) at Cerritos College, Norwalk, Friday, 4 p.m., NBC Sports California\nDivision 2-A state championship: San Joaquin Memorial (14-0) vs. Lawndale (13-2), at Cerritos College, Norwalk, Saturday, 4 p.m., NBC Sports California\nDivision 4-AA state championship (Dec. 8): Pleasant Valley-Chico 43, Central Valley Christian-Visalia 14\nDivision 5-AA state championship: San Gorgonio-San Bernardino (12-3) at Rio Linda (12-2), Saturday, 6 p.m.\nDivision 5-A state championship: San Diego (11-2) at Colfax (13-0), Saturday, 6 p.m.\nDivision 6-AA state championship: Hilmar (12-2) vs. Strathmore (13-1), Saturday, 6 p.m.\nDivision 6-A state championship: Orange Glen-Escondido (10-3) vs. Lincoln-San Francisco (12-0) at City College of San Francisco, Saturday, noon\nPLAYOFFS?

{{Getty Images\nSo much for San Antonio and Los Angeles. The Raiders could be on the verge of striking a deal to stay put in Oakland.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, the team and the city have reached a tentative agreement on the construction of a new home for the Silver and Black.\n\u201cI expect it to be executed soon,\u201d attorney Zach Wassrman said. Wasserman represents the developers of Coliseum City, a sports, housing and retail complex that would be constructed near the new venue.\nThe Chronicle characterizes Raiders owner Mark Davis as having final say over whether the arrangement will proceed.\nThe stadium would be built with funds generated by the Coliseum City project, resulting in a reduced (and possibly non-existent) financial obligation for taxpayers. However, the public would be on the hook for the $120 million still owed as a result of the O.Co Coliseum expansion that brought the Raiders back to town more than a generation ago.\nSo where does the $120 million come from?\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great question that we will probably not say anything about,\u201d a spokesman for Oakland mayor Jean Quan told the Chronicle.\nLand also would be transferred from the city at no charge, but the new stadium \u2014 expected to cost between $900 million and $1.2 billion \u2014 would be paid for separately.\nIt\u2019s unclear how this arrangement would affect the A\u2019s, who recently signed a 10-year lease to play at a place that will be blown up, sir if/when the deal goes through.\nSo this one is far from being resolved. But at least it shows that progress has been made to keep the Raiders from leaving town, again.\n}}
{{He finished his senior 10-game regular season with 111 tackles and 14 sacks. He was nearly unblockable at times from his defensive tackle position.\nNo wonder Woodland High School\u201ds Damien Borel was named the Tri-County Conference\u201ds defensive player of the year.\nBorel\u201ds is the top honor among the 12 local players named to the All-TCC team. Pioneer placed seven players on the squad (running backs Jacob Schoch and Sammy Marquez, offensive linemen Dylan Kinser and Shayne Souza, linebackers Thomas Gonzalez and Jimmy Mahoney and athlete Jay Puckett) while Borel was joined by four of his Woodland teammates (athlete Dalen Jones, defensive back Wyatt Bartholomew, linebacker John Morris and offensive lineman Justin Davis).\nYuba City running Back Taylor Rowe earned league MVP honors after compiling over 1,500 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns in the regular season. Inderkum had both the offensive MVP (running back Jordan Adams) and lineman of the year (tight end/defensive end Randy Allen).\nBorel was the most disruptive force on a solid Wolves defense and showed his overall athleticism returning the occasional short kickoff or catching two passes (one for a touchdown) during the rare times Woodland used him at tight end.\n\u201cComing from the defensive tackle position (Borel\u201ds stats) are pretty impressive,\u201d Woodland coach Bert Salinas said. \u201cA lot of his tackles were made from behind, running people down.\u201d\nBorel will likely go the junior college route next year according to Salinas, who added that every junior college in the region has shown interest in the 6-foot-3-inch, 245-pound standout.\nAmong his Wolves teammates named to the squad, Bartholomew likely landed as a defensive back because of the slew of talented running backs in the league. The junior himself was actually most effective as a running back, finishing the regular season with 690 yards rushing and six touchdowns.\nSenior Justin Davis\u201d honor was the most unlikely when the season began, according to Salinas.\n\u201cHe probably by far made the biggest improvement over all four years of football,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cHe wasn\u201dt even in a starting role during camp. Then someone got injured, he stepped in and really took over. He got a little more fire, a little more ornery.\u201d\nBartholomew, Jones and Morris were selected as juniors for the 6-5 Wolves. The Patriots, meanwhile, landed five seniors from an 8-3 team that had one of the best seasons in school history.\nThen again, success has been the norm for Pioneer\u201ds senior class. It won the outright TCC title at the junior varsity level and shared the crown as freshmen with Inderkum and River Valley.\n\u201cI\u201dm just so proud of what we accomplished. I think we all though we could accomplish what we did,\u201d Patriots coach Matt Bryson said.\n\u201cWe spoke openly about being TCC champions. It was a little fuel to the fire having people question whether we could do it.\u201d\nIt helped matters to have a player like Souza, who at 6-1, 215 pounds was a jack of all trades.\n\u201cHe just has an explosiveness, that\u201ds his thing,\u201d said Bryson, who used Souza as a defensive end and tackle, and a middle linebacker.\nKinser had similar versatility.\n\u201cHe was our left tackle on offense and we mixed him in a great deal on the defensive line \u2014 he was a tackle and a noseguard,\u201d Bryson said. \u201cAt 6-5, 285 he was one of our two or three biggest guys.\u201d\nPioneer received seven all-league selections compared to Woodland\u201ds four (excluding Borel\u201ds award) because of its status as the TCC\u201ds No. 2 team. Pioneer, Yuba City and Woodland tied for second in the TCC behind Inderkum with 3-2 league records. For all-league selection purposes only the TCC used the Sac-Joaquin Section\u201ds 13-point tiebreaker rule (utilizing the margins of victory in head-to-head results, with 13 being the largest margin possible) to place the Patriots second and the Wolves fourth. Yuba City was third and received six All-TCC selections in addition to the MVP Rowe.\n}}
{{There will definitely be more than one winner no matter what the final score of tonight's Lehigh Valley All-Star Football Classic which begins at 7:30 at Andy Leh Stadium in Nazareth with the East Penn Conference standouts taking on the Colonial/Centennial League stars.\nThe annual event, now in its 18th year, will most importantly generate proceeds to benefit the Volunteer Paramedic Groups of the Greater Lehigh Valley. However, football players, coaches, cheerleaders, and fans will be enriched by the total experience.\nEPC coach Ted Steiner has expressed that the game is meant to be a community affair which will not only benefit many residents, but create better interest in the upcoming season. Colonial/Centennial mentor Dick Ortwein believes that both the players and coaches benefit from the exposure to seasonal competitors. Also, not only do the players get to showcase their talents, but the cheerleaders, coached by Susan Unger, strut their stuff for perhaps the final time of their careers.\n\"This is an experience you will remember for years to come. You can look back and feel proud for your efforts and tell people you participated in the all-star game of 1987,\" Ortwein told his troops after yesterday's final warm- up. He then shook each players' hand and distributed t-shirts and certificates that, along with the game jerseys, will serve as mementos.\nOver 800 advance tickets have been sold according to board member Cindy Adams. Last year approximately 500 advance tickets were sold and 4,000 fans eventually jammed Bethlehem School District Stadium, allowing the Lehigh Valley coaches to present the Paramedics with a $2,000 check.\nYesterday, the Colonial/Centennial squad spent the final practice scrimmaging while the East Penn team went over specialty groups and teams.\nEast Penn wide receiver Jon Pinckney, a Bethlehem Catholic grad who is enrolling at Stanford, took a break from last night's practice to explain his excitement at participating in the classic.\n\"Before last season even started I wanted to play in this game,\" said the 6-2, 175-pounder. \"We've been here practicing for two weeks and we got to prove that we're better than the other team. I'm sure the feeling is mutual and the natural rivalry between these divisions makes the game more meaningful. Plus you get to play with guys you didn't really know before and maybe didn't like. But now you get to like them.\"\nColonial/Centennial League linebacker Dan Grant, a Pocono Mountain product who will pursue either football or wrestling at Purdue, was eager to put on the pads.\n\"We're ready to play and licking our chops. They (EPC) think they have it wrapped up, but we have other thoughts,\" he said. \"But just being here is exciting because you get to play with a bunch of guys who all know what they're doing. You can depend on them to be where they're supposed to be and just concentrate on your job.\"\nEach coach has been pleasantly surprised by at least one player who has surpassed pre-practice expectations.\nCoach Steiner is high on Whitehall's Tim Clancy who wasn't initially chosen to the squad, but got onto the team because Allen's John Morgan was injured. The defensive left end did so well this week that his teammates elected him game captain. Also, Steiner is proud of Liberty's Warren West who was listed as a defensive back/runningback/wide receiver, but asked if he could play quarterback in place of no-show Dan Yannes of Parkland. West has not quarterbacked since his junior year.\nOrtwein singled out Nazareth's Mark Ferraro who has done an outstanding job as a last minute replacement at offensive center. Ortwein has named quarterback Pat Rinard of Stroudsburg as offensive captain and end Rich Shander of Catasauqua as defensive captain.\n\"I've been pleased with the movement and quickness off the ball that we have on defense and our passing game has developed well,\" said Ortwein. \"With each of these kids being an all-star in their own right, the coaches have tried not to over-coach. They've been learning new alignments but we've just been telling them where to go, not how to get there.\"\nSteiner is happy with quarterback West and Rob Melosky of Northampton and is not worried about the passing game. In fact, he's pretty happy with his whole team and is ready to roll.\n\"We didn't do any intensity work because we've been too busy trying to teach everyone what to do. But at 7 p.m. we're going to turn up the intensity level and get the guys pumped up.\"\nAll persons involved in the game hope that area fans will be equally as pumped up and show their support by populating the stands.\n}}

{{HERRIMAN \u2014 It took John Cullen years to learn to love football.\nWhen it came to rugby, however, the former Utah offensive lineman was passionate from the first play.\nBut as a teen growing up in California, the former Utah offensive lineman realized it was football that offered him the best chance to play collegiate sports.\nStill, he doesn\u2019t believe he would have achieved his goal of playing college football \u2014 or in the NFL \u2014 if he hadn\u2019t found rugby his freshman year of high school.\n\" It\u2019s a sick obsession with the sport.

I wouldn\u2019t have been the player I was in high school, which then got me to college, it\u2019s not even a discussion. I didn\u2019t even play my freshman year of high school football. I was a bench warmer. I came back, and I was on varsity my sophomore year after one season of rugby.\u201d\nHe\u2019s willing to concede he doesn\u2019t know if there is a direct correlation for every player, but there certainly was some impact for him.\n\u201cIt will either toughen you up,\u201d he said, \u201cor you won\u2019t play anymore.\u201d\nNot only did the 28-year-old stick with the sport, he returned to it after his dreams of playing in the NFL didn\u2019t materialize. After stints with practice squads for both the Chargers and the Jets, Cullen decided to return to the University of Utah and finish his degree while playing rugby in his final year of athletic eligibility.\nThat decision paved the way for an opportunity that just a few years ago he couldn\u2019t have imagined possible \u2014 Major League Rugby in the U.S.\nA special kind of 'suck'\nCullen was introduced to rugby in the weeks after he finished playing his freshman season of football.

I don\u2019t have to be 300 pounds, and I get to score.\u201d\nCullen said the mental toughness required by each sport was similar because the physical demands are uniquely brutal. But rugby, he said, requires an embrace of pain that is found only in a few sports.\n\u201cMaybe only the combat sports, UFC and wrestling, have this, but there is just no other level of suck like rugby,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re different from the individual sports because we\u2019re doing it, and 15 guys have to be held accountable.

{{It is always dangerous to discount underperforming players after only three weeks, but it's also important to regularly reassess your fantasy players based on what we've seen on the field.\nAt the QB position, Tony Romo (Cowboys) and Tom Brady (Patriots) have been so disappointing they've even been outscored by preseason third-stringer Austin Davis (Rams).\nAnd there are valid reasons to downgrade both, as Dallas is more determined to run the ball than anticipated while New England's offensive line has crumbled. However, both have been too consistent for too many years to consider them anything worse than QB2s.\nAt WR and TE, fantasy points can be volatile, so it is important not to rush to judgment. But, there are legitimate reasons to downgrade Vincent Jackson (WR, Buccaneers), Larry Fitzgerald (WR, Cardinals), Torrey Smith (WR, Ravens), and Jordan Cameron (TE, Browns).\nWhile none should be cut, if you can find a willing trade partner valuing them based on preseason hype, feel free to offload them.\nMeanwhile, no position has disappointed quite like RB, where elite preseason players have let down their owners. Injuries have derailed Jamaal Charles (Chiefs), and Adrian Peterson (Vikings) is no longer playing for off-the-field reasons, but one has to dig a little deeper to understand why Matt Forte (Bears), Eddie Lacy (Packers) and LeSean McCoy (Eagles) haven't performed better.\nBoth Forte's and Lacy's best excuse is simply that they have faced some very talented defenses thus far. Their matchups will get easier. Meanwhile, offensive line issues and additional carries for Eagles backup Darren Sproles have minimized McCoy's impact.\nHowever, McCoy has still averaged 23.3 touches per game, and the offensive line will get healthier in the coming weeks. Thus, while all three may not wind up dominating quite as their owners hoped, they should still be considered RB1s.\nEat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help.

{{Georgia, a team that gave no inkling of being national champion timber before the season, now surveys the realm from college football's most coveted pinnacle -- the No. 1 position in both wire-service polls.\nThe Beatles surely would have labeled the Bulldogs' ascent a magical, mystery tour, a perfect season forged on the heels of a disappointing 6-5 record the previous year. No other team, not even ones originally sporting the \"invincible look\" such as Pittsburgh, Ohio State, or Nebraska, could match Georgia's 12 -straight victories.\nThe \"Dawgs,\" of course, were not always a steamroller either. Few teams have ever won a landslide national title with less convincing results. \"The best thing you can say about these guys is they haven't got beat,\" volunteered assistant coach Rusty Russell before Georgia beat Notre Dame 17- 10 in the Sugar Bowl to lock up its first football crown.\nThe victory kept any other bowl result from having a bearing on who finished No. 1. Yet who lined up where the remainder of the Top 20 was decided largely in the Orange, Rose, and Cotton Bowls, plus other post-season contests.\nPittsburgh, for example, turned in a strong showing in the Gator Bowl, beating South Carolina 37-9, to move up to the No. 2 ranking in the final UPI coaches' poll with an 11-1 record.\nSeven squads with 10-2 marks came next, all but No. 5 Florida State winning its final game. Oklahoma, an 18-17 victor over Florida State in an exciting Orange Bowl rematch, finished No. 3. Michigan broke its drought in the Rose Bowl, knocking off Washington impressively, 23-6, to secure the No. 4 spot.\nNo. 6 Alabama, the undisputed national champion last year and a joint tenant of the honor in 1978, \"salvaged\" its season by annihilating Baylor, 30-2 in the Cotton Bowl. No. 7 Nebraska took care of Mississippi State 31-17 in the Sun Bowl and No. 8 Penn State defeated Ohio State 31-19 in the Fiesta Bowl.\nThings fell uncannily into place all season long for Georgia, beginning with a 16-15 escape against Tennessee in the opener. Later came a potentially game-saving fumble recovery against South Carolina on a ball coughed up by Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers and a 93-year touchdown pass in the waning moments to beat Florida.\nEven Georgia's schedule, made up years in advance, was a thing of wonder. It called for the Bulldogs to play all but three Southeastern Conference members, including Alabama and Mississippi State, their strongest league rivals.\nThe well of good fortune could easily have run dry at this point, but it didn't. For in the Sugar Bowl, a fluky play virtually gave Georgia one touchdown, a 22-yard \"drive\" following a fumble recovery set up the other, and a 46-yard field goal, also after a turnover, completed the winner's scoring.\nUltimately, Notre Dame appeared to outplay the nation's top-ranked team, limiting it to one pass completion and 127 total yards the entire game, while holding it scoreless in the second half.\nWhat Georgia did, though, was put more points on the board -- a tried and true way of winning.\n\"The stats don't matter,\" said Bulldog quarterback Buck Belue. \"We won the game. We're the type of team that figures out how to win a game. We're an opportunistic team.\"\nOpportunity never knucked louder than it did late in the first quarter, when Notre Dame's tandem deep men let a kickoff bounce free at the two-yard line. It was a bizarre error caused by the pair's inability to communicate amid the din that engulfed New Orlean's Superdome.A Georgia player pounced on the loose ball, setting up Herschel Walker's leap into the end zone. For the record, Walker (A misnomer if ever there was one) rumbled for 153 yards, a figure partially offset by 65 yards in quarterback sacks.\nHere, again, Georgia can consider itself fortunate, for how many times does a freshman emerge to carry an entire offense? Not often, and maybe not at all beginning next year, when the NCAA possibly will declare freshmen ineligible for varsity competition.\nIt is to Notre Dame's credit that it played such a gritty game, particularly in the face of continued frustrations. One wouldn't expect the Fighting Irish to go down any other way, however, especially not with a chance to send retiring coach Dan Devine out a winner. Next year, the reins will be taken by Gerry Faust, coach of Cincinnati's Moeller High School, a producer of many Notre Dame players.\nOverall, the conference that fared the worst in post-season play was the Southwest. Baylor, the conference champion by a sizable three-game margin, was embarrassed in the Cotton Bowl; No. 9 North Carolina knocked off Texas in the Bluebonnet Bowl; and Southern Methodist was edged by No. 11 Brigham Young in the Holiday Bowl. Houston and Arkansas nailed down victories in lesser bowls, but the conference was shut out of the Top 10, with Baylor at No. 13 its highest ranked team.\nThe Pacific 10 didn't exactly enjoy a banner year either. Washington won the conference crown outright to legitimately earn the Rose Bowl berth, which five league members were ineligible for. Yet its loss to Michigan dropped the Huskies to No. 17, as Southern Cal and UCLA -- among the Outcast Five -- secured the 12th and 14th spots.\n}}
{{Saturday December 15, 2018 12:11 AM\nShareef Miller, Miles Sanders and Connor McGovern acknowledge they are considering foregoing their final year with the Nittany Lions\nSTATE COLLEGE - Three Penn State juniors said Friday they're playing in the Citrus Bowl against Kentucky, but the Jan. 1 game very well could be their final college appearance.\nDefensive end Shareef Miller, running back Miles Sanders and guard Connor McGovern at least acknowledged they're considering foregoing their final year with the Nittany Lions to enter the NFL draft.\nMiller, a two-year starter and an All-Big Ten third-team pick this season, said he's already made his decision.\n\"I'm going to make my announcement after the bowl,\" he said. \"I talked to Coach Spence (defensive line coach Sean Spencer), a coach I love and trust. He keeps it real with me. I met with Coach Franklin (head coach James Franklin) and my family.\n\"I can't really say what Coach Spence said word for word. It was great input. I listened to him.\"\nMiller has seven sacks (third on the team) and 14 tackles for loss (second on the team). Drafttek, a site devoted to the NFL draft, rates him as the No. 11 defensive end available in the draft.\nMiller is on track to receive his degree in rehabilitation and human services in May.\n\"I just have to do my internship,\" he said. \"I'm done with classes and exams. It feels great. I don't have homework. Nothing.\"\nMiller left no doubt that he will play in the Citrus Bowl.\n\"Because they're my brothers,\" he said of his teammates. \"I'm playing for them. It's always been like that. I wouldn't do anything selfish like that.\"\nAfter backing up Saquon Barkley for two years, Sanders has rushed for 1,223 yards and nine touchdowns this season and was named to the All-Big Ten second team. Draft analysts rank him anywhere from the sixth-best running back available to the 11th.\n\"I've been really focused on finals,\" Sanders said. \"Now I'm focused on Kentucky. I haven't really been thinking about it (whether to return to Penn State next season). We had a meeting with Coach Franklin. It was the players who could potentially leave.\n\"I haven't really made a decision.\"\nAsked whether he expects to play against Kentucky, Sanders said: \"Yes, sir. I will be playing in the game.\"\nMcGovern, a three-year starter on the offensive line, is rated as the No. 4 guard in the draft and the No. 5 center by Drafttek. He was named to the All-Big Ten third team this season.\n\"Right now, I'm focused on the game,\" McGovern said. \"I have to make some decisions. The day after the Maryland game, he (Franklin) brought me and my family in for discussions and updated us on the process.\"\nMcGovern also was asked whether he'll play against Kentucky.\n\"Oh, I'm definitely playing,\" McGovern said.\nThere was no indication that any of the four seniors who start for Penn State would sit out the Citrus Bowl. Senior cornerback Amani Oruwariye is projected as a second-round pick, but he's playing.\n\"It's important (to play) because it's my last opportunity as a Penn State player and my last opportunity with my brothers,\" Oruwariye said. \"It can help me for the next level. It's another opportunity to catch someone's eye and make a play. I'm excited for it.\"\nMiller was asked how he would like to be remembered by Penn State fans if the Citrus Bowl is his final game.\n\"As a guy who gave everything he had, who was real passionate and who loved to win,\" he said. \"Coming from where I come from (Philadelphia), having the support from Penn State fans and the community who accepted me, that was real great.\n\"I want them to remember me as a great person, a great player and a great teammate.\"\nContact Rich Scarcella: 610-371-5070 or rscarcella@readingeagle.com.\n}}

He\u2019s a key defensive player for Palmdale, which is looking to break a 12-game series losing streak against visiting Hart, traditionally one of the Southland\u2019s highest-scoring teams. Woods, a returning All-Golden League linebacker, figures to be an important factor if the Falcons want to break the streak.\nDAILY NEWS: You open against Hart, and they\u2019ve defeated Palmdale 12 times in a row by an average margin of nearly four touchdowns. What do you think?\nWALTER WOODS: It\u2019s going to be a test. We know that. But we\u2019ll be prepared.\nDN: The other thing is, Palmdale has kind of a reputation for being aslow starter, agreed?\nWW: We have. It seems like we always lose the opener, but we\u2019re trying to change all that and give a different perception. I think we can handle our own.\nDN: You\u2019ve got two really good quarterbacks returning, Brandon Mims and Joshua Shaw. What\u2019s that like?\nWW: Well, Brandon will start at quarterback, and that means Josh goes to wide receiver, so that gives us two weapons on the field at the same time.\nDN: You can do a double pass, where you throw to Joshua, and he throws downfield, right?\nWW: Oh, we haven\u2019t tried that yet, but maybe we can throw it in.\nDN: You\u2019ve also got running back Marquell Jefferson returning. He had a great year last year but also got into some trouble. How\u2019s he doing?\nWW: Marquell is working hard, and he\u2019s ready to play. He\u2019s got his head straight. He\u2019s a pretty big guy, too. When he goes one-on-one against a cornerback, I feel kind of bad for the cornerback.\nDN: Palmdale has won a lot of games through the years \u2013 you\u2019re 31-1 over the past 32 Golden League games \u2013 but has never won a title. You lost last year in the Western Division championship game at St. Paul (of Santa Fe Springs). What happened that night?\nWW: It was a tough night, but no excuses. They had quicker blockers than we\u2019d seen, quicker than Dominguez, who we had beat the week before. Just a different technique.\nDN: You\u2019re 6-foot and 275 pounds. Not your typical linebacker, know what I mean?\nWW: Yeah, I get that a lot. I just try to take a great angle and read plays well, but in college I\u2019ll probably switch to defensive line and focus on that more.\nDN: And you can play short-yardage fullback, too. Are you going to score any touchdowns this year?\nWW: I\u2019ll try. I scored when I was a sophomore. I\u2019d love to see me and Marquell in the backfield at the same time.\n}}
{{The Mininera and District Football League representative squads have been named for the junior carnival in Hamilton on Sunday. The league will send an under-16, under-14 and under-12 team to compete in the event with no official interleague matches scheduled this year. Alistair Rentsch will coach the under-16s while the duties will be shared by Archie Conboy, Lachie and Tyson Marr for the under-14 representative squad. Matt Burmeister will take on the coaching role for the league\u2019s under-12 group. League chairman John Box said it was a good opportunity for the players to face players they wouldn\u2019t normally come up against teams they would not normally be against. \u201cI think it is a great opportunity especially for the Mininera and district league,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of our players get overlooked sometimes, so this is a good chance to play some high quality football against other leagues in the region. \u201cYou always want to get a win, it is competitive but you are playing against top-line footballers but it It is something the league hopes to embrace in future years but Box said he was hoping for a slight change next season. \u201cDefinitely something we want to embrace in the future but it is disappointing some of the boys who are playing in the under-16.5s are unable to play, due to the competition being under-16 only,\u201d he said. Each team plays games in a round robin format against other squads from the Hampden, Warrnambool and district, Portland and Hamilton and district leagues. The games will be 10-minute quarters with finals to follow in the afternoon. Box said the under-12 team was still being finalised and will be released by Friday night. \u201cWe will have a full squad but we have not got all the names together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working on it at the moment and once the lists are complete, we will forward them onto the clubs so they are aware of which juniors will be playing.\u201d Games will be played at Pedrina Park, the Mininera start times are at 9.55am, 10am and 10.30am for under-12, under-14 and under-16. Under-16 team: Will Cooper, Charles Waites, Caleb Robinson, Mitch McKinnis, Shaun Moran, Josh Rentsch, Duncan Rentsch, Aaron Glare, Oscar Linke, Brent Wardlaw, Ethan Turner, Oscar Reynolds, Jaylen Lyons, Jackson Thomas and Tyler Wineberg.

{{This is not chaos.\nEven after four top-10 teams (Georgia, West Virginia, Washington and Penn State) lost last weekend, the top 10 is still comprised solely of teams that were ranked before the season started.\nIt can\u2019t be chaos when similar upsets happen every season. It can\u2019t be chaos when more than half the season remains. It can\u2019t be chaos when the top three teams (Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State) have possession of the past four national championships, or when the No. 4 team (Notre Dame) is the sport\u2019s most storied program, or when the No. 6 team (Michigan) has the most all-time wins, or when the rest of the top nine is made up of college football\u2019s elite (LSU, Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma).\nChaos rarely comes, and not just because Alabama has won five of the past nine national titles. In the playoff era, only nine schools have claimed the 16 spots. This century, there has been no first-time national champion.\nEven if it felt new two years ago when Clemson broke a 35-year title drought, the Tigers have become as powerful as any program outside of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and have made three straight playoff appearances.\nThis week, Clemson (6-0) faces its biggest hurdle to a fourth trip, against North Carolina State (5-0), the ACC\u2019s only other ranked team. In the past two years, the Wolfpack have given the Tigers fits, losing by seven last season, and losing in overtime the year before, following a missed 33-yard field goal that would have been a game-winner.\nThis year, N.C. State averages more than 35 points per game, surrenders the nation\u2019s 12th-fewest per game (17.8 points), and has a senior quarterback (Ryan Finley), who soon will be an NFL first-round pick.\nHowever, the No. 16 Wolfpack have built their status against James Madison, Georgia State, Marshall, Virginia and Boston College. It is the same path West Virginia took to become the No. 6 team in the nation. It is the reason why it is too early for most rankings to carry any weight.\nWith CLEMSON (-17), you know where you stand \u2014 and you know where the Tigers will be by season\u2019s end.\nStanford (-2\u00bd) over ARIZONA STATE: David Shaw and Herm Edwards have both had nearly two weeks to prepare for Thursday\u2019s game. Something tells me Shaw has come up with the better game plan.\nBOISE STATE (-23\u00bd) over Colorado State: Brett Rypien\u2019s recent slump ends in a meeting with the nation\u2019s 105th-ranked defense.\nTCU (+8) over Oklahoma: Firing defensive coordinator Mike Stoops won\u2019t solve the Sooners\u2019 defensive shortcomings. If it were that simple, just about every team in the Big 12 would do the same thing every season.\nMichigan (-7) over MICHIGAN STATE: Much is made of Jim Harbaugh\u2019s terrible record against his in-state rivals, but the Wolverines coach would be 2-1 against the Spartans if not for the one of the craziest endings in college football history \u2014 Blake O\u2019Neill\u2019s fumbled punt in 2015. The Spartans aren\u2019t going to pull another rabbit out of their hat (head?) after last weekend\u2019s shocker over Penn State.\nIOWA (-9\u00b9/\u2082) over Maryland: D.J. Durkin has made nearly $600,000 since being put on administrative leave as coach in August. That is all. Enjoy your day. Jordan McNair won\u2019t.\nCincinnati (+3\u00bd) over TEMPLE: The unbeaten Bearcats are coming off a bye, and will play the three-loss Owls in a mostly-empty Lincoln Financial Field. The crazier part is that Temple pays the Philadelphia Eagles seven figures each year for the rights to a neutral-site atmosphere.\nTENNESSEE (+29) over Alabama: This year\u2019s consistently overinflated Alabama lines make it too hard to have much confidence either way. Nick Saban enters his first game against Jeremy Pruitt with a 13-0 record against former assistant coaches, winning by an average of more than 26 points.\nColorado (+15\u00bd) over WASHINGTON: Someday, the Huskies may live up to their reputation as the Pac-12\u2019s most talented team. Someday, the Pac-12 might look like a power conference, too.\nINDIANA (+15) over Penn State: With a couple of breaks, the Nittany Lions easily could have come out on the right side of their four losses over the past two seasons, decided by a total of nine points. Talent isn\u2019t the problem, and that has revealed an even deeper issue on their sideline.\nEAST CAROLINA (+21) over Central Florida: The Pirates have shown up in their biggest on-paper games this season, beating North Carolina, and taking a tie into the fourth quarter against No. 21 South Florida.\nLSU (-6\u00bd) over Mississippi State: Single-threat Bulldogs quarterback Nick Fitzgerald has thrown for an average of 104 yards per game, with no touchdowns and two interceptions in SEC play, and won\u2019t be able to win with his legs against one of the country\u2019s top run defenses.\nOhio State (-13\u00b9/\u2082) over PURDUE: Nick Bosa\u2019s departure could cost the Buckeyes a national championship \u2014 but it won\u2019t have much impact until they face an opponent in their weight class.\nWASHINGTON STATE (-3) over Oregon: The high-powered and well-rested Cougars haven\u2019t lost at home in nearly two years, while the Ducks are due for a letdown after their overtime win against Washington.\nKENTUCKY (-11) over Vanderbilt: Benny Snell has led the Wildcats to back-to-back wins over the Commodores, rushing for 116 yards and three touchdowns last year. The nation\u2019s eighth-leading rusher (116.5 yards per game) could have an even bigger day against a defense allowing an average of 257 rushing yards in its four games against power conference opponents.\nBest bets: Iowa, Washington State, Kentucky\nThis season (best bets): 54-61-1 (10-11)\n2014-17 record: 518-471-10\n}}
{{Head coach Urban Meyer of the Ohio State Buckeyes during the Goodyear Cotton Bowl against the USC Trojans in the second quarter at AT&T Stadium on December 29, 2017 in Arlington, Texas.\nAdvertisement Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer to retire Share Shares Copy Link Copy\nAs Urban Meyer walked off the field after Ohio State routed Michigan, he was pondering his future and when to make a decision about when to call it quits.The 54-year-old Meyer, in fact, had been thinking about retiring since the middle of last season.The pain from headaches caused by an arachnoid cyst in his brain had grown worse this season. Off-the-field issues, including a three-game suspension for mismanagement of an assistant coach accused of domestic violence, had worn on him. And an ideal successor just happened to already be in place in the person of Ryan Day, his 39-year-old offensive coordinator.On Tuesday, two days after the Buckeyes beat Northwestern to earn a second consecutive Big Ten championship, Meyer announced he was stepping down after the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 and likely would never coach again.\"The decision was a result of cumulative events,\" Meyer said during a packed news conference. \"And health number one. The fact that we have an elite coach on our staff. The fact that our program is very healthy. We've recruited very well. All played a significant role in this.\"Meyer is leaving at the top of his profession after three national championships in a career spanning three decades, the last seven years at Ohio State, where he has an 82-9 record.He had shown obvious effects of being in pain on the sideline this season, leading to questions about his future. Meyer explained that the headaches became severe last season during Ohio State's game at Penn State and have become a persistent problem this season.Meyer said he believed he could no longer coach the way he has from the early days at Bowling Green to Utah, Florida and, finally, with the Buckeyes.\"The style of coaching I've done for 33 years is very intense, very demanding. I tried to delegate more and CEO more and the product started to feel ...,\" he said, not finishing his thought. \"I didn't feel I was doing right by our players and by Gene (Smith, the athletic director).\"Meyer said leaving would have been more difficult if the program wasn't healthy. The Buckeyes are 12-1 and Meyer said he felt good about his replacement. Day will take over as the 25th coach of the storied program where Meyer won a national title in 2014 after two at Florida (2006, 2008).\"You want to hand it off to someone who could make it stronger,\" Meyer said.It was Day who led the Buckeyes when Meyer was suspended before the season opener over his role in the handling of now-fired assistant Zach Smith, who was accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse. Meyer said he knew about the allegations against Smith \u2014 grandson of former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce \u2014 but wasn't sure they were true and kept Smith on staff because no criminal charges were filed. The university cited that lapse in suspending Meyer after an investigation.A report issued by an investigative committee left a stain, detailing behavior by Meyer that could have taken down a coach of lesser stature. The investigation showed he tolerated bad behavior for years from Smith, including domestic-violence accusations, drug addiction, lies and other acts that directly clash with the values Meyer touts publicly.Meyer acknowledged the investigation was among the reasons for stepping down, and he was asked if the suspension will affect his legacy.\"I'm sure it will,\" he said. \"I can lie to you and say it is not important to me.\"The announcement came as the Buckeyes begin preparations for the bowl game against Washington and less than three weeks before schools can sign a fresh batch of recruits. Meyer said his decision had to come before the early signing period opens Dec. 19.The Buckeyes' strong finish this season belied on-the-field problems that made for a stressful season for Meyer and his staff. He lost star defensive end Nick Bosa to an early season-ending injury, and the defense never fully recovered.The team alternated expected blowout wins with puzzling play that included a pair of one-point wins (Penn State, Maryland) and a closer-than-expected win over a struggling Nebraska team. A startling blowout loss at unranked Purdue on Oct. 20 pushed Ohio State to the fringe of the national championship chase and prompted questions about Meyer's future. He was forced to address speculation that he would step down and Oct. 29 said he definitely planned to return next season.Ohio State followed that with five straight wins, including a rout of archrival Michigan that gave the Buckeyes another division title and then pulled away for the easy win over Northwestern.The success was nothing new for Meyer, who was a standout coach at Utah before he left for Florida in 2005 and rocketed to the top of the college football coaching ranks, a peer of Alabama coach Nick Saban in terms of respect and ability. Critics noted that his success with the Gators was marred by a series of legal issues for his players, with more than two dozen arrests.Almost exactly nine years ago, Meyer shocked college football by resigning at Florida after five seasons amid what he called stress-related health concerns that came to light when he suffered chest pains following the SEC championship game. He quickly changed his mind, returned for another season and then stepped down in December 2010, saying he wanted to spend more time with family.He was 46 then. And he wasn't gone long: He took the Ohio State job before the 2012 season after Jim Tressel was forced out for lying to the NCAA amid a memorabilia-for-tattoos scandal.It appeared to be a dream job for the Toledo native. His contract was extended in April by two years through 2022, increasing Meyer's salary to $7.6 million in 2018 with annual 6 percent raises. Meyer has about $38 million left on his contract.Ohio State will now turn to Day, a second-year Ohio State assistant who had never before been a head coach before he stepped in during Meyers' suspension. Gene Smith said transitioning immediately to Day made more sense than conducting a national coaching search.\"Our program does not need disruption,\" Smith said. \"It does not need to blow up and have people come in and try and adapt to our standards of operation and try and change the infrastructure that we've put in place for the student-athlete.\"Former players and fellow coaches were full of praise for Meyer. As former Ohio State running back Carlos Hyde gushed about Meyer in the Jacksonville Jaguars locker room, former Florida defensive end Lerentee McCray walked by and shouted \"Urban Legend! Urban Legend!\"\"He's definitely one of the best coaches I've been around,\" Hyde said. \"That's one thing I'm going to always remember about him: We won so much.\"\n}}
{{Liberty Athletics will embark on its first season of FBS football next month with the full support of the NCAA Division I Strategic Vision and Planning Committee.\nEarlier this week, Liberty Athletics received notification the committee had approved a submitted annual report and updated strategic plan, agreeing to advance the athletics program to Year Two of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) reclassification process.\n\u201cWe are excited to progress into year two of the Football Bowl Subdivision reclassification process and appreciate the support from the NCAA Strategic Vision and Planning Committee,\u201d said Director of Athletics Ian McCaw. \u201cPresident Falwell\u2019s leadership and commitment has afforded the football program the necessary infrastructure to succeed at the highest level of college football.\u201d\nOn Feb. 16, 2017, the NCAA approved Liberty\u2019s waiver request to begin the two-year FBS reclassification process.\nLiberty Athletics has spent the last 17 months meeting all the necessary requirements for the FBS reclassification process, including playing its final season at the FCS level during the 2017 season. Liberty was a member of the Big South Conference during the 2017 season, but was not eligible for postseason competition.\nLast week, Liberty announced a secondary bowl agreement with the AutoNation Cure Bowl for the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Although Liberty is currently in the middle of its two-year FBS transition process, the NCAA bylaws do have provisions for the Flames to qualify for a bowl game in 2018 now that they have successfully transitioned to Year Two of the FBS reclassification process, and if they are a deserving team.\nTeams from the Sun Belt Conference and American Athletic Conference are scheduled to play each year in the AutoNation Cure Bowl. However, in years in which either conference does not have enough deserving teams, defined as meeting the six qualifying win threshold, other FBS teams may be substituted before consideration would be given to five-win teams.\nLike this: Like Loading...\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n}}

A third player Mike Kenosky was treated and released from the hospital.\nPhotos from the crash show the devestating wreckage, with the car split in two. However, despite the nightmarish week, family members of two of the injured players were at the game, wearing their relative's jersey.\nSteve Dienno's grandfather sat in the stands next to Justin Bullock's father Franklin.\nBullock says he is greatful for all of the support that has been shown in and beyond the Pocono Mountain East community. He says,\"A lot of prayers, a lot of prayers, a horrific thing happened, but things happen, people are teenagers, things happen.\"\nSenior Kayla Elliott described why both of the players are so popular.\n\"Steven's like an outgoing kid, when you need someone he is there for you, and Justin puts a smile on your face and makes you laugh all the time.\"\nThe boys numbers, #3 and #38 were everywhere as parents and kids raised money for the injured players.\nThe Gridiron Club offered bumper stickers and t-shirts and collected cash in buckets at the gates. They hope to help all of the families involved with their medical bills and other expenses.\nBullock says his son has a long road ahead, but being surrounded by support is helping him face the hardship.\nHe says,\"It's humbling, very humbling, it takes a tragedy to bring a community together like this, it's really beautiful.\n}}
{{Campaigners are demanding that football clubs in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank to be banned from playing in Israeli leagues.\nFIFA\u2019s Council will be meeting next week (Jan 9 to 10) to decide the issue and the Red Card Israeli Racism campaign urges the council to be guided by International Law and FIFA Statute 72 (2).\nSpokesperson Dr. Geoff Lee said that under the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal. Allowing settlers to play in the Israeli leagues was tantamount to supporting the Occupation.\n\u201cIt is invidious to give them this status, glossing over the fact that the settlements are built on Palestinian-owned land and are a grave breach of International Law\u201d he said.\n\u201cMeanwhile football matches between Palestinian clubs in the Occupied Palestinians Territories are routinely disrupted because Israeli soldiers won\u2019t allow teams to move freely about their own country.\n\u201cFootballers have been shot in the feet. Palestinian center forward Mahmoud Sarsak was locked up without trial or charge for three years. He will never play football to the same standard again following the treatment he received at the hands of his gaolers.\n\u201cThis is the reality in the Palestinian territories.\n\u201cIsraelis will argue that the situation is very complicated, that the status quo should be maintained in order to keep football clear of politics. But the legal situation is not at all complicated. FIFA does not need to take a political decision, but simply to observe international law.\u201d\nDr Lee cited the support of high profile lawyers such as QCs Geoffrey Bindman, Michael Mansfield as well as former UN Special Rapporteurs John Dugard and Richard Falk. Twenty-five MPs and more than 60 MEPs had also lent their names to the campaign, he added.\n(For more information visit Red Card Israeli Racism website.)\n}}

{{Henry Baker has received a big pay bump from his first stint on Chris Ash\u2019s coaching staff.\nBaker, a Paterson native who returned to Rutgers in December after one year at North Carolina, received a two-year deal with a base salary of $275,000 as Rutgers' new cornerbacks coach and pass game coordinator, according to contract terms obtained by NJ Advance Media after an open records request.\nBaker made $175,000 when he was on Rutgers' staff in 2017. He then left for a significant pay raise at North Carolina - $275,000, according to USA TODAY - that Rutgers has now matched upon his return. Baker is also set to make $25,000 more annually than Cory Robinson made before he left for a position on Maryland\u2019s staff, opening the door for Baker\u2019s return. Robinson\u2019s base salary was $250,000 annually.\nBaker has a $30,000 buyout if he leaves the staff prior to March 30, 2020 to accept another job.\nIt\u2019s worth taking note of the increased salary as Ash seeks to fill at least two more positions on his staff, specifically the now-open offensive line spot. Ash and offensive coordinator John McNulty are interested in potentially hiring Wisconsin inside linebackers coach Bob Bostad, a person with knowledge of the situation told NJ Advance Media, and he may be a coach they can land if the money is there.\nBostad, who worked with Ash at Wisconsin and with McNulty at two NFL stops, made $370,000 this past season - only $20,000 more than departed offensive line and associate head coach A.J. Blazek made. A healthy pay bump and the ability to coach the line again - Bostad has spent the bulk of his career with that group - could be enough to snag him from a Big Ten rival.\nJames Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com.

{{LONDON (AFP) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed victory over Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho at the 14th attempt as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's goal gave the FA Cup winners a 1-0 win in Sunday's Community Shield.\nThe England midfielder struck in the 24th minute at a sun-soaked Wembley Stadium to break Mourinho's longstanding hold over his French rival and give Arsenal hope of a sustained assault on Chelsea's Premier League title.\nWhile Chelsea improved in the second half, they could not find a way past their former goalkeeper Petr Cech, who registered a clean sheet as his new club claimed their 13th outright Community Shield.\nWenger will be mindful that a 3-0 win over Manchester City in last season's Community Shield was not followed by a convincing title bid, but with Cech already looking at home and Mourinho no longer able to boast a spotless record against him, he will approach next weekend's opening league fixtures with pre-season belief fully intact.\nChelsea's team-sheet suggested that Diego Costa is not yet free of the hamstring problems that plagued him last season, with Loic Remy leading the line in the Spain striker's absence and new signing Radamel Falcao on the bench.\nQuestions about the reaction that Cech would receive from the fans of his old club were answered quickly, a standing ovation greeting him as he jogged over to the goal at the Chelsea end prior to kick-off.\nNot for the first time, Wenger is embarking on a season with a surfeit of midfielders and he unveiled a new shape here that saw Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla line up on either flank, allowing Aaron Ramsey to take up his favoured central role alongside Francis Coquelin.\nWith Mesut Ozil shadowing lone striker Theo Walcott, who signed a new four-year contract on Friday, Arsenal were able to cluster men around the ball both in and out of possession, swarming around Chelsea's midfielders to win the ball back before zipping quick passes between each other.\nAfter Walcott had worked Thibaut Courtois with a header, he created Arsenal's opener in the 24th minute with a pass wide to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who cut inside Cesar Azpilicueta and lashed home left-footed.\nHazard squanders chance\nIt was Arsenal's first goal against Chelsea in 506 minutes of football.\nA quiet showing from Eden Hazard left it to Ramires to drive Chelsea forward, the Brazil international curling wide from distance and heading a cross from Remy over the bar.\nBut there was greater thrust to Arsenal's attacks and Ramsey threatened to add a second when he slammed a shot into the side-netting.\nRemy, caught offside four times in the first half, gave way for Falcao at half-time and Oscar entered the fray shortly after in place of his countryman Ramires.\nThe changes revived Chelsea and after Oscar had dragged wide, Cesc Fabregas gave Hazard a clear sight of goal with a slide-rule pass, only for the off-key Belgian to blaze wastefully over from eight yards.\nCech was finally tested in the 69th minute, springing to his right to palm a free-kick from Oscar behind, which drew an approving roar from Arsenal's supporters.\nMoments earlier Olivier Giroud, a replacement for Walcott, had slid a cross from Oxlade-Chamberlain over the bar and he was to spurn an even better chance, prodding Ramsey's right-wing cut-back over the top.\nCech also had to field a header from Chelsea substitute Kurt Zouma, but the best late openings fell to Arsenal, only for Courtois to save alertly and impressively from first Cazorla and then Kieran Gibbs.\n}}

{{El-Hadji Diouf endured a forgettable spell at Liverpool (Picture: Getty)\nSenegal international Sadio Mane has admitted that his idol growing up was his compatriot and former Liverpool forward El-Hadji Diouf.\nHeralded as a coup for Liverpool after signing following an exceptional World Cup in 2002, Diouf\u2019s time at Anfield was instead marred by controversial incidents, the most famous of which was when he spat at a supporter during a UEFA Cup game against Celtic.\nA total of six goals in 79 appearances for the club wasn\u2019t much of a return on Liverpool\u2019s sizeable \u00a310m investment in Diouf while his negative comments about Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher since retiring have further diminished his reputation amongst Liverpool\u2019s fanbase.\nDiouf was sent off against Celtic for spitting at a supporter (Picture: Getty)\nIn an interview on French TV, Diouf said he did not respect Gerrard as a player and labelled Carragher \u2018s**t\u2019. Despite his regular criticisms of the two Liverpool legends, though, Diouf is a hero to Mane, as is former Barcelona star Ronaldinho.\nSpeaking at length to Bleacher Report, Mane said: \u2018When I was young, I had lots of favourite footballers, but Ronaldinho was my real favourite, along with El-Hadji Diouf from Senegal. They really inspired me.\n\u2018Those two players were examples for me as a footballer. They were skilful players and good dribblers who beat their opponents easily.\n\u2018I was a very good dribbler as a young player, but now that I\u2019ve got more experience, there are some useless things that I don\u2019t do anymore.\n\u2018It\u2019s all about making and scoring goals for the team, like my idols did when they were at the peak of their powers.\u2019\nDiouf certainly had his share of controversial moments during his time in British football in spells with Liverpool, Bolton, Sunderland, Blackburn, Rangers, Leeds United and Doncaster United.\nThere were further accusations of spitting while he was playing for Bolton and Doncaster, while Neil Warnock labelled him a \u2018sewer rat\u2019 after he allegedly taunted Jamie Mackie after he had suffered a broken leg.\nNevertheless, despite his reputation in England, Diouf is revered in his homeland for his performances for the Senegalese national team, particularly during the country\u2019s run to the World Cup quarter-final\u2019s in 2002.\nSadio Mane scored during Liverpool\u2019s 2-1 win over Leicester (Picture: Getty)\nMane meanwhile has far surpassed Diouf\u2019s accomplishments at Liverpool since joining from Southampton in a \u00a336m deal in 2016, becoming an integral member of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side in attack, alongside Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah.\nHe is the leading goalscorer in the Premier League this season with four in as many games and will be looking to extend that record against Spurs at Wembley on Saturday.\n}}
{{LONDON (Reuters) - Dressed in a sharp grey suit, blond hair neatly side-parted and wooing a crowd of French reporters with his boyish English charm, David Beckham began the latest, and possibly final, chapter of an extraordinary boys\u2019 own football tale on Thursday.\nSoccer player David Beckham (R) presents his new jersey as he stands near Nasser Al-Khelaifi (L), Paris St Germain's club owner and owner of Qatari TV channel Al Jazeera Sport, President of beIN Sport French TV channel, and Paris St-Germain sports director Leonardo (C) after a news conference in Paris January 31, 2013. Former England captain Beckham has joined Paris St Germain on a five-month contract, the French Ligue 1 club said on Thursday. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nGiven the clamor surrounding his signing of a five-month deal with Paris St Germain, the marketing gurus will already be rubbing their hands at the thought of Beckham sprinkling his magic dust on the ambitious club\u2019s global profile.\nWhether or not Beckham\u2019s brief tango in the City of Light has much impact on the club\u2019s performance on the field of play is another matter, as they doing rather well already.\nOne thing, however, is for sure.\nThe 37-year-old, despite the glitz and glamour, the Hollywood friends and an annual turnover the size of a small country, will be desperate to prove he still has something to offer the game that made him a sporting icon.\n\u201cWherever I\u2019ve played, whatever team I\u2019ve played for, I\u2019m always 150 percent committed,\u201d Beckham told a news conference in which he announced his salary would be paid to a children\u2019s charity in the French capital.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this will be my last contract. People have been speculating about that for a number of years, but I continue to play and sign contracts.\n\u201cI will see how I feel but I want to play as long as possible. My passion is football. It always has been.\u201d\nSome may see PSG\u2019s signing of the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder as little more than a gimmick, but Beckham\u2019s fanatical devotion to the game means PSG fans can look forward to some illuminating cameo performances.\nThe week in week out hurly burly of league football might be too much for Beckham\u2019s ageing legs, but as an impact substitute, manager Carlo Ancelotti may have a useful weapon in his armory.\n\u201cI can run around,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cI\u2019ve not lost any of my pace because, to be honest, I\u2019ve not had a lot of pace during my career. For me, Carlo Ancelotti is one of the best managers I have played for. It\u2019s exciting on a number of levels.\u201d\nWhatever Beckham\u2019s impact on the pitch, his presence around the training ground will do PSG no harm as they try to win the French title and progress in the Champions League in which they face Valencia in the last 16.\nGLOWING PRAISE\nHaving not played a match since signing off with LA Galaxy in the MLS Cup final in November, Beckham trained with Arsenal this week to regain his fitness and received glowing praise from Arsene Wenger.\n\u201cThis guy has fantastic quality and has done the maximum in his career. Why? Because he loves football. After training he stays and plays,\u201d Wenger said.\nFrom the day a teenaged Beckham scored a goal from inside his own half for Manchester United in 1996, most of his career has been spent scaling dizzy heights.\nWhile never blessed with lightning pace, nor the tricks of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, Beckham\u2019s tireless energy, trademark free-kicks and ability to deliver crosses on a coin, made him a potent force.\nAt Manchester United, the club of his boyhood dreams, he was instrumental in six Premier league titles. After leaving Old Trafford he spent four years at Real Madrid, winning LA Liga in his final season before pitching up in Los Angeles in 2007.\nWith Galaxy he joined a select group of players to win titles in three countries and yet, rather than relax on the California beaches during the off-season, the father of four twice headed back to freezing Milan for loan spells with Milan.\nNothing has given Beckham greater pride, however, than captaining his country and in 2009 he became England\u2019s most capped outfield player, edging past the 109 of Bobby Moore.\nA Champions League winner with Manchester United in 1999 and twice runner-up in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards, there is precious little missing from Beckham\u2019s footballing CV while his off-field appeal continues to soar.\nOnce nicknamed Golden Balls, Beckham has had films named after him, become an ambassador for his country, befriended Hollywood A-listers and British royalty and even played a James Bond-inspired role in last year\u2019s London 2012 opening ceremony.\nWhile the family man clearly enjoys the fame and fortune he has gained from his talent, a passion for battle on a football pitch remains his real fix.\nHis five months in Paris could be the last stop for the Beckham bandwagon although on Thursday he declared he still felt like a 21-year-old so who knows where the story will end?\nA circus it may be, but Beckham clearly remains the ringmaster.\n}}
{{As the various dramas surrounding Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones whirl around the NFL and Donald Trump today called for the suspension of the Oakland Raiders\u2019 Marshawn Lynch for not standing for \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d during a league game against the New England Patriots in Mexico City yesterday, seemed almost a low-key affair.\nGoing distinctly not low-key, the President got going early this morning and once again centered his social media spotlight on the continuing protests taking place on the sidelines of NFL games.\nMarshawn Lynch of the NFL\u2019s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2017\nIn that context, SNF could seem low-key that is unless you are the Philadelphia Eagles and you demolished the Cowboys 37-9 last night on SNF in Arlington, Texas. In what was the Cowboys\u2019 worst loss ever at AT&T Stadium, every member of both teams escaped Trump\u2019s anger as they all stood for the National Anthem in a Week 11 that saw protests through the day at home and abroad. On the field itself, the blowout win sees the team from the City of Brotherly Love with the NFL\u2019s best record at 9-1 and dominating the NFC East.\nHowever, with such a lopsided game and facing the American Music Awards on ABC, Sunday Night Football itself scored a 13.5/22 in metered market results \u2013 a very not low-key rating for the NFL and NBC.\nEven with the big point spread, the ratings-challenged league and network won again by having the big-draw Cowboys playing and maybe getting some political calm on the sidelines. Last night\u2019s game was up 17% from last week\u2019s SNF to hit the best rating for any NFL primtime matchup since Week 1 of the season. Which, of course, is a solid win for the night for the net.\nLooking back to last week, that 8:30-11:30 PM ET Patriots\u2019 41-16 beatdown of the Denver Broncos on November 12 went on to snare a 5.8/20 rating among adults 18-49 with 17.5 million fans watching.\nCompared to the Week 11 SNF of last year, last night\u2019s Eagles win saw an uptick of 14% over the Green Bay Packers 42-24 loss to the Washington Redskins on November 20, 2016.

{{RIALTO >> One of the multitude of high school football coaching positions has been filled and Rialto High School didn\u2019t need to look far.\nRialto\u2019s school board approved Robert Mitchell as the school\u2019s new head coach, replacing Drew Young.\nMitchell played football, wrestled and was on the track and field team at Rialto, graduating in 1999. He is the head wrestling coach at the school and also a substitute teacher in the district.\n\u201cHe has a very unique interest not only in the success of our school, but our athletic program. He bleeds royal blue,\u201d Rialto Principal Arnie Ayala said in a voice mail. \u201cHe knows his football. He\u2019s built a lot of positive relationships with our students and staff. We are very excited to have him on board.\u201d\nSaid Mitchell: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some success here before and I want to get back to that. We\u2019re going to take a wrestling mentality. We\u2019re going to grind it out for 48 minutes.\u201d\nAthletic Director Dan Williams felt Mitchell\u2019s connection to Rialto was a big part of his hiring, but it went beyond that.\nIn terms of coaching football, He first coached football at Carter, went to Rancho Cucamonga, then coached football at Rialto under Gavin Pachot including the last time the Knights made the playoffs in 2013. He applied for the job when Pachot resigned, but didn\u2019t get it and went back to Rancho Cucamonga. There, he was the offensive line coach and running game coordinator last year, and had some play-calling duties.\nSaid Mitchell: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just run. We\u2019ll mix it up.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been part of a winning program over there,\u201d Williams said of Mitchell\u2019s time at Rancho Cucamonga. \u201cAnd he\u2019s committed to Rialto High School.\u201d\nWilliams said Mitchell has also served as an assistant track coach at Rialto and Williams believes that will serve him well as Mitchell recruits players to play football from other sports.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a really good connection with the kids here at the school,\u201d Williams said.\nMitchell said he just needs to pass one more test for his teaching credential before he can begin his student teaching, which he hopes he can start in the fall.\n}}
{{Kalani Sitake\u2019s vision of bringing the best football recruits possible to BYU may originate from a worldwide perspective, but the sample size of prospects still remains small and extremely targeted, and the requirements for admission are getting tougher.\nBut he still has the charm, according to assistant head coach Ed Lamb, who sees it up close.\nStarting this past week, Sitake began sending recruiters to respective territories from coast to coast and the islands of the South Pacific.\nUtah head coach Kyle Whittingham has been the beneficiary of Sitake\u2019s recruiting at Utah and told ESPN 960 this past week that, as a school, BYU\u2019s greatest competitive advantage is getting prospects who \u201cwant to go to BYU no matter what.\u201d\nIn Sitake and quarterback coach Aaron Roderick, BYU has inherited two very good recruiters from rival Utah. How can BYU best use them?\nIt\u2019s not as complicated as one might think because the recruiting universe is whittled down significantly, said Lamb.\nFor instance, BYU had a Junior Day last weekend, and those who came were mostly prospects who\u2019d been on campus most of their lives. Coaches were very familiar with them and their parents, and many knew BYU football history by heart.\nAlmost two months ago, BYU released recruiting coordinator Tevita Ofahengaue and has yet to replace him. Lamb said unlike other schools, that position may morph more into a technology, social media expert because there is significant \u201crecruiting\u201d experience on Sitake\u2019s staff. A \u201choarder\u201d of recruiting targets isn\u2019t necessary.\n\u201cWe do not cast a wide net here in comparison with other schools. We have a different dynamic. First, there are the returning missionaries and second, there are a number of walk-ons who have stepped up and are deserving of scholarships. That impacts our numbers,\u201d Lamb said.\nPointing to a wall in the football office lobby where names of 2018 signees are featured, Lamb said he can point to guys there who didn\u2019t \u201ctake much salesmanship\u201d to sign.\n\u201cThey grew up as Cougar fans and were just waiting for the offer.\u201d\nAt most Pac-12 schools, Lamb said, a recruiting coordinator may start with 10,000 prospects and narrow it down to 700 or 800. At BYU, a recruiting year doesn\u2019t even start at 700. \u201cIt\u2019s a much lower number.\u201d\nSaid Lamb, \u201cI believe it\u2019s a higher trust factor we have to establish with the player and the parent. It\u2019s a deeper and more deliberate decision a recruit has to make, and in that way it\u2019s more work to do but less work in terms of the actual number.\u201d\nLamb admitted the 2017 four-win season had an impact on some recruits who decided to go elsewhere on signing day, but there were other highly regarded athletes whom the Cougars did not want in the end.\nLamb said Sitake often may not get credit for recruits he got to come to BYU including running back Zach Katoa, linebacker Chris Folau, quarterback Zach Wilson and one of BYU\u2019s most dominating defensive linemen sophomore Khyiris Tonga.\nKnowing some fans like to count recruit star rankings and judge, Lamb said the ultimate judgment is wins.\n\u201cOur fans are only looking for victories on the field, and that is the end result of recruiting,\u201d he said.\nLamb explains a Sitake recruiting strength that doesn\u2019t show up in signing day ratings, a factor he proved at Utah and will do so at BYU. It is something he has experienced.\n\u201cIf I started to reel off names of kids that have accomplished the most in the sport that I\u2019ve recruited, nobody else recruited them,\" he said. \"They aren\u2019t guys who would be exciting to fans until they\u2019ve moved on to the NFL. Kalani has that same kind of experience. Many of the guys he brought into Utah were under the radar or developed from walk-ons or guys he switched into other positions.\u201d\nSitake is known for switching player positions and finding success, guys like Trevor Reilly, Paul Kruger and Harvey Langi.\nHe also turned walk-ons into all-conference players, including Christian Cox and Mike Wright, who came from SUU.\n\u201cHis relations inside the business, his reputation, is more about the guys he has developed, as much as recruited,\" Lamb said. \"He has found diamonds in the rough, guys he has taken from among walk-ons, moved to other positions and has had an eye for it.\u201d\nThose players have moved on to become NFL prospects for the Utes.\n\u201cReally that is more about development. The thing that usually makes a strong player developer is that he can develop trust,\" Lamb said. \"The reputation Kalani does have as a recruiter is the fact he can walk into a room with a group of coaches and he\u2019s the one the players feel the most comfortable with. Pretty soon they\u2019re all gathered around him.\n\u201cHe still has that magic, but that doesn\u2019t win games, and those aren\u2019t always the guys we\u2019re after. If anything, there is a history here at BYU of highly ranked recruits coming in and not living up to expectations,\" he said. \"This is a really tough place for a guy who really feels entitled, or that BYU owes him something for being here. This is a place where if you are a highly recruited player and you choose BYU, your gratitude is not going to come from your opportunity at BYU, it is going to come from your environment at BYU. We are keeping a close eye on that. It just has to be about wins.\u201d\nIndeed, wins absolutely solve most debates in coaching and recruiting.\nSitake circa 2018 is about getting more wins. And recruiting with proper development has to be the answer.\n}}
{{1) Micky Quinn (PAOK Thessaloniki 1995-96)\nIt is hard to imagine a striker as typically old-school as Micky Quinn choosing to broaden his horizons. He was a burly scouser, his nickname was \u201cSumo\u201d because of his wobbly midriff and he was unashamedly fond of a pie and pint. So how was it that he ended up seeing out his career in northern Greece with PAOK Thessaloniki aged 33? \u201cThey offered me twice as much money as I\u2019d been earning for just one season in Greece.\u201d Ah. He also wanted to carry on playing after being released by Coventry and had received very few offers in England despite having been prolific pretty much everywhere he played. His signing was seen as a coup in the Greek Super League. The club met him with garlands off the flight and hundreds of fans turned up to roar their approval as he stepped off the plane with eyes agog. That was as good as it got.\nThe Dutch coach Arie Hann left to manage Feyenoord a few months into the season and PAOK\u2019s form took a nosedive. The club chewed up three managers between October and February and \u201cthe chairman was driving round with guns in his car because of all the stick he was getting\u201d, explained Quinn who was as wary of possession football as he was of club owners with firearms. \u201c[It] was dire. There were 70 passes before you even crossed the halfway line \u2026 you\u2019d get one chance and if you missed it you\u2019d be slaughtered in the papers.\u201d Quinn left in February, criticising the club in the press for the shambolic way in which they were run, with many players not receiving their wages unless the previous game had attracted a large crowd. He still kept his goal ratio up though, having scored seven in 15. He never played again.\nThe Joy of Six: happy endings in sport | Nick Miller Read more\n2) Johan Cruyff (Feyenoord 1983-84)\nThree years after leaving Barcelona to see out his career in his slippers in the US, Johan Cruyff got bored and returned to Ajax to end it on a serious note. Even in his mid-30s his brilliance was such that he inspired his boyhood club to the league and cup double in 1983, his majestic left foot launching wave after wave of attacks that swept the club to glory. So when he wasn\u2019t offered a contract extension at the end of the season, you can imagine how it went down. His blood boiled to the extent that he crossed one of football\u2019s most venomous divides, signing a contract at Feyenoord.\nJohan Cruyff\u2019s Feyenoord lost 8-2 to Ajax and won the double. Photograph: Getty Images\nThe sight of Cruyff in Feyenoord\u2019s kit simply didn\u2019t look right. The press were stunned. Fans of both sides, who bitterly hated each other, didn\u2019t know how to act. Cruyff\u2019s new Feyenoord team-mates treated him warily at first, perhaps still unsure of his motivations but they soon found their groove and won five of their first six games before Cruyff\u2019s return to face Ajax. Feyenoord lost 8-2 amid scenes of violence on the terraces. Was Cruyff\u2019s move about to turn into a disastrous one?\nNot in the slightest. With the burgeoning talent of a young Ruud Gullit beside him, Cruyff\u2019s Feyenoord went on a run of 15 games unbeaten, including 12 wins. As the season neared its end, Ajax visited De Kuip. Cruyff wouldn\u2019t be humbled again. He had been allowed to have his say on tactics and Feyenoord were now confusing teams by playing advanced full-backs. Ajax could not handle them. Feyenoord were 2-0 up inside 15 minutes thanks to goals from Gullit and Cruyff. Their 4-1 victory fuelled a successful push for the title. The satisfaction this win gave Cruyff cannot be underestimated. Feyenoord won the Cup too. Cruyff had wrestled away the two trophies he won at Ajax and placed them in Feyenoord\u2019s trophy cabinet as a gigantic and simply glorious two-finger salute to Ajax. He could now retire. Bravo.\n3) Terry McDermott (Cork City and Apoel 1985-87)\nThe five-time league champion and triple European Cup winner was 34 when he got a phone call from his former Newcastle team-mate Tommy Cassidy asking him to come and play for Apoel in Cyprus, for whom Cassidy was manager. At the time Terry McDermott was flying over to Cork City each weekend, where he was often taken out for a night on the booze before having to trot out at Turners Cross the next morning for which he\u2019d receive a brown envelope containing his wages. It wasn\u2019t the most glamorous \u2013 or healthy \u2013 way to end such a decorated career and he was on another level in terms of ability. \u201cThere was a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be making the runs I used to make at Liverpool and unfortunately, the players couldn\u2019t find you because they\u2019re not looking for you.\u201d\nWith his shaggy hair and pale skin, he wasn\u2019t a fan of hot weather but decided to give Cyprus a go. He would be helping out a mate after all and Cassidy believed that with McDermott running things in midfield he could help get the best out of the former Spurs and Leyton Orient striker Ian Moores, who had joined Apoel the previous season. McDermott struggled to make an impact at first. \u201cTerry\u2019s game was all about running,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cFor four months in the heat he was rubbish. Then one day Terry rang me, thrilled it was raining, and in the end he won us the title.\u201d He helped win them the Cup too, to complete the double for the first time in the club\u2019s history. And despite mostly hating the weather, he stayed another season before bringing the curtain down on a brilliant and often overlooked career in 1987.\n4) Clarence Seedorf (Botafogo 2012-14)\nThe only player to win the European Cup with three different clubs was quite some signing for the least celebrated of the four big Rio teams, Botafogo. At 36, Clarence Seedorf had been pushed into the background at Milan by Max Allegri, who wanted to field a more youthful team. Often \u2013 and this seems absurd \u2013 Alberto Aquilani and Kevin Prince-Boateng were preferred in midfield. There were no shortage of suitors for Seedorf in Europe when he left San Siro, so why Botafogo? Partly because of a deep admiration for the Brazil national team. \u201cWhen I was watching the 1986 World Cup with my dad, he had to take me outside and calm me down after Brazil lost to France,\u201d Seedorf explained. \u201cI was crying with anger, because it was Zico\u2019s last tournament. For me, he was what football was all about.\u201d\nClarence Seedorf in action for Botafogo against Flamengo. Photograph: Ricardo Ramos/Getty Images\nAnother reason is Seedorf\u2019s heritage. He was born in Suriname, which borders northern Brazil and returning to play football in south America felt right. He also wanted to play with freedom in his twilight years, and this he did. It\u2019s not often you see a 37-year-old bursting forwards so often in matches but the sight of his powerful legs defying their years to transport Seedorf to the edge of the box was a regular one in his season and a half at the Est\u00e1dio Nilton Santos. He scored 24 goals, his athletic ability \u2013 which was far greater than that of most other footballers his age \u2013 meaning he was able to get around the pitch extraordinarily well and constantly get on the ball. He instilled a winning mentality in callow team-mates and inspired them to win the Rio State Cup and qualify for the Copa Libertadores by finishing fourth. To make his swansong even more romantic, he scored the third goal in the 3-0 win against Criciuma \u2013 his final professional appearance \u2013 to take them there. \u201cI\u2019m retiring with tranquility. Brazil welcomed me with open arms. I\u2019ll never forget that,\u201d a tearful Seedorf said after the match. His influence was such that without him Botafogo were relegated in 2014.\nThe Joy of Six: seasons from hell | Niall McVeigh Read more\n5) George Best (Brisbane Lions, Osborne Park Galeb 1983 and Tobermore United 1984)\n\u201cI\u2019m as fit as one can be at 37,\u2019\u2019 smiled George Best upon arrival in Australia in 1983. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t compare for pace with the player I was 10 years ago. But skill \u2013 that improves with age.\u201d Best\u2019s descent from one of the most talented players in the world to a late-30s alcoholic desperately on the lookout for a payday to help him out of debt is an achingly sad one. Best was reported to be earning around \u00a325,000 to play in the National Soccer League for three weeks. Brisbane expected a bumper crowd and good publicity. It didn\u2019t quite work out to plan. Only 3,500 fans turned up at Perry Park to watch Best help Brisbane to a 2-1 win over Sydney Olympic in his first game. According to Queensland\u2019s Courier Mail, the match was a bruising one, with Best dislocating a finger and confining \u201chimself to probing passes and corner kicks\u201d while keeping \u201cclear of some robust midfield skirmishing, preferring to find space for himself in a deep-lying role on the left wing\u201d whatever that means. Still, a win\u2019s a win.\nBest showed very little interest in the next three matches, a 3-0 defeat by St George, a 1-1 draw with Marconi and a 4-0 humbling at the hands of Adelaide. \u201cBest\u2019s disinclination to run or tackle became a handicap,\u201d reported the Courier Mail. He did score on his trip Down Under, when he turned out for Osborne Park Galeb, a wealthy amateur club founded by Croatian immigrants. Best\u2019s final competitive appearance came closer to home at Tobermore United, the only Northern Irish club that Best represented. Fortwilliam Park was packed as 4,000 fans flocked to watch Best, who had flown in from LA. They lost 7-0 to Ballymena. \u201cHe had agreed to play in the game and did what he had to do, attracting a crowd of thousands,\u201d said Tobermore\u2019s current chairman, Raymond Beatty. But the truth is that Best was the footballing equivalent of an ageing exotic animal being gawped at in the zoo in the hope it will do one last trick. That so many people were prepared to part with their hard-earned knowing they would probably be let down, tells you how good his tricks used to be.\n6) Socrates (Garforth Town 2004)\n\u201cSubstitution for Garforth Town, ladies and gentlemen. Replacing No2, Matt Higginbottom, is No6, Socrates.\u201d It still beggars belief that this happened in a competitive match, the 50-year-old chain-smoking World Cup star peeling off his coat (but not his gloves) to make a 13-minute appearance in midfield on a freezing cold November night at Wheatley Park stadium. \u201cI hear it\u2019s 28 degrees in S\u00e3o Paulo!\u201d came a shout from the crowd as Socrates familiarised himself with a football pitch again 15 years after he thought he\u2019d retired.\nSocrates feels the chill in North Yorkshire. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images\nWith the score 2-2 against Tadcaster Albion, Garforth were soon in the ascendancy and Socrates took a feather-toed touch on the edge of the box before stinging the palms of the visiting goalkeeper with a dipping shot. \u201cGive t\u2019ball to Socrates! Give t\u2019ball to Socrates!\u201d yelled a couple of old fans, according to a report in the Yorkshire Post. Socrates was probably quite happy to avoid it. \u201cThe second I got out on the pitch I suffered a terrible headache,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cUnfortunately, the cold was very bad. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve experienced anything like it.\u201d His brief appearance in the Northern Counties East League came after Simon Clifford, the club\u2019s then owner and manager, had met the Brazilian while promoting his Brazilian-style Socatots coaching schools. \u201cI decided not to play him in the next game because his warm-up had consisted of drinking two bottles of Budweiser and three cigarettes which we had in the changing rooms,\u201d said Clifford, when paying tribute to the Brazilian after his death in 2011.\n}}
{{USC inked 10 players to letters of intent during the inaugural early signing period before Christmas, one of the smaller classes in the Pac-12 Conference.\nCoach Clay Helton hinted at the time the Trojans would be able to sign more players during the traditional February signing date as a result. National Signing Day is Wednesday.\nAmong those already in the fold, Helton and his staff stockpiled more recruits on defense, with seven defensive players \u2013 including four linebackers, three players selected for the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and a junior college defensive lineman.\nWhile USC has a few verbal commiments with possibly a few more to come Wednesday, here\u2019s a look at USC\u2019s early signees:\nOL Justin Dedich: Played center and on the defensive line at Chaparral High in Temecula, helping the Pumas reach the CIF Southern Section Division 5 quarterfinals. So far the only interior offensive lineman signed or committed to USC. Also showed versatility as the goalkeeper for Chaparral\u2019s soccer team.\nOL Liam Douglass: The Trojans\u2019 second offensive lineman to sign in December lined up as a tackle at Harvard-Westlake. Also played on the defensive line, where he finished with 16 tackles, four sacks and a forced fumble and was named co-most valuable lineman for the Angelus League with Gabriel Grbavac of St. Francis.\nLB Palaie Gaoteote IV: One of the top linebackers in the nation after finishing with 80 tackles, including 20 for loss, three sacks and two forced fumbles in 2017 for powerhouse Bishop Gorman High in Las Vegas. Nephew of former NFL safety Ma\u2019a Tanuvasa, he\u2019s a candidate to wear the fabled jersey No. 55, last worn by Lamar Dawson from 2011-15.\nS Talanoa Hufanga: The two-way standout at Crescent Valley High in Corvallis, Ore., who lined up at wide receiver and safety will be a defensive back at USC. Had 44 tackles, four interceptions and a recovered fumble as a senior. Cousin is Marlon Tuipulotu, a defensive tackle for the Trojans who appeared in three games as a freshman in 2017 before season-ending back surgery.\nLB Kana\u2019i Mauga: Among the four linebackers who signed early with USC and an athletic outside linebacker, listed at 6-foot-2, 220 pounds, from Waianae, Hawaii. Led Waianae to the Hawaii High School Athletics Association open division semifinals. Also played tight end.\nLB Abdul-Malik McClain: Former UCLA commit who also played defensive end at JSerra High, establishing a reputation as a prolific pass rusher, ending with 45 tackles, plus 18 sacks as a senior. The 6-foot-4, 230-pound recruit could develop into a hybrid edge rusher much like USC linebackers Porter Gustin, Oluwole Betiku and Connor Murphy.\nLB Raymond Scott: Four-year starter at Narbonne High who played inside linebacker until a move to outside linebacker as a senior, when he led the Gauchos to a CIF State Division 1-A championship. One of USC\u2019s two linebacker signees who appeared in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in January, joining Gaoteote.\nRB Markese Stepp: Missed three games as a senior at Cathedral High in Indianapolis, but rushed for 975 yards, averaging almost eight yards per carry, with 17 touchdowns to help his team reach the Class 5A state semifinals. Former Notre Dame commit instead signed with the Trojans due to connections with former running backs coach Deland McCullough \u2014 a teammate of his father at Miami (Ohio).\nDT Caleb Tremblay: The one junior-college recruit among USC\u2019s 10 early signees, enrolling for spring practice with two seasons of eligibility left. Finished with 44 tackles, including 9.5 behind the line of scrimmage, and 4.5 sacks last season for American River Community College in Sacramento. The 6-foot-5 prospect adds size to the defensive line. Also received a scholarship offer from Alabama.\nCB Chase Williams: The one cornerback to join USC during the early signing period \u2014 a position of need as six of the Trojans\u2019 nine cornerbacks on the roster entering 2018 are upperclassmen, including four who are seniors.

{{US Senate on Wednesday confirmed Indian-American Neomi Rao, who was under scrutiny for her past writings on sexual assault, as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most powerful benches in the country. Rao, 45, will replace controversial Brett Kavanaugh who endured a bitter confirmation battle last year after US President Donald Trump named him to the US Supreme Court.\nHer confirmation came amidst stiff resistance from the opposition Democratic lawmakers and a nationwide campaign against her by rights groups for her previous position on sexual assault and minorities. Rao was confirmed by 53-46 votes in the US Senate, which was basically on party lines. The Republicans enjoy majority in the 100-member US Senate. After being sworn in, she would be the second Indian-American on this court, which is considered only next to the US Supreme Court.\nMeanwhile, opposition Democratic party said Rao did not deserve to be confirmed. \u201cA vote for Neomi Rao is a vote for a judge who blamed survivors of sexual assaults for being attacked. It is a vote for a judge who claimed sexual orientation is a \u2018behavior\u2019 that can be changed,\u201d said Democratic National Committee\u2019s Women\u2019s Media Director Elizabeth Renda and LGBTQ Media Director Lucas Acosta.\nRao is currently serves as the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget. In this capacity she played a key role in regulatory reform.\nPrior to her service as OIRA Administrator, Rao was a professor of structural constitutional law, administrative law, and legislation and statutory interpretation at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.\nShe founded the Law School\u2019s Center for the Study of the Administrative State and focused her scholarship on the political and constitutional accountability of administrative agencies and the role of Congress. She has served in all three branches of government including Associate Counsel and Special Assistant to President George W Bush. She also served as counsel to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where she was responsible for judicial nominations and constitutional law issues.\nIn between government service, Rao practiced in the London office of Clifford Chance LLP, specializing in international law and commercial arbitration.\nFirst Published: Mar 14, 2019 08:40 IST\n}}
{{Members of a legislative conference committee made several changes to a \u201cBuy American\u201d iron and steel bill that would expand a provision already in effect for the Texas Department of Transportation and the Texas Water Development Board, according to a report released Thursday evening.\nSenate Bill 1289 by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, would require large state projects \u2014 such as buildings, roads and bridges \u2014 to purchase iron and steel from an American supplier if the cost doesn\u2019t exceed 20 percent more than the price of cheaper, foreign imports. Under the bill, any country's iron and steel can be used if American suppliers aren't prepared to supply a project or there is a compelling state interest.\nIn the conference committee, lawmakers delayed \"Buy American\" provisions for water projects until May 2019 \u2014 meaning that up until then, water infrastructure projects wouldn\u2019t be required to use American-made iron and steel. A study would be conducted during the interim to assess how using American metal would affect the cost of these projects.\nBoth chambers now need to sign off on the amended language before the measure can head to the governor\u2019s desk.\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\nThe bill's House sponsor, state Rep. Chris Paddie, R-Marshall, said President Donald Trump\u2019s recent \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order may help garner momentum for the measure. Last session, a similar measure died in a House committee.\nAmong the bill's opponents is the Canadian steel industry. Three representatives of the Canadian government wrote earlier this month they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with how the bill would affect Texas-Canada trade relations. The letter notes that Canada is the top export destination for U.S. steel products, representing roughly $9.7 billion in trade last year.\nDespite this, lawmakers in the conference committee denied the exemption request.\nQuality journalism doesn't come free Perhaps it goes without saying \u2014 but producing quality journalism isn't cheap.

{{Beauty queens have won congressional, senatorial, even gubernatorial elections. Most prominently, one fell a few million votes shy of America's vice presidency (though her status as a first runner-up in Miss Alaska 1984 makes her more beauty jester than queen).\nAs of Tuesday, though, the grand dame of beauty queens \u2014 Miss America herself \u2014 has yet to convince voters that she deserves elected office. Next year, that could change, and Erika Harold, who announced plans to run for Illinois' 13th congressional seat, could be the woman to do it. What's more: She's more than qualified to do it. And maybe she just should be in Congress.\nIn 2003, Harold was crowned Miss America, earning her the tiara, the sash, and the title. But that's never what she was after. According to the bio on her newly launched campaign site, the pageant was a means to a much more intellectual end: \"Erika decided to compete in the Miss America Organization to attempt to earn the scholarship money necessary to pay for law school.\" And lest voters think she sold out her mind by using her body, reports from 2003 say she wasn't even very good at the swimsuit and evening gown portions of the competition. \"Harold won by blowing away the seven Miss America judges with her intelligence, quickness, presence, and genuineness in her closed-door interview,\" Jake Tapper wrote in a 2002 story that Jezebel dug up.\nAfter winning her crown and spending a year touring the nation promoting messages of anti-bullying and abstinence, Harold enrolled in Harvard Law School and immediately threw herself into national politics. She was an organizer for George W. Bush's \"W Stands for Women\" and a GOP convention delegate in 2004. Poor judgement of presidents aside, Harold is about as qualified as a 33-year-old comes. She works as an attorney, serves on the board of directors of Prison Fellowship, and has had national office on her mind since high school.\nBut before moving into the Capitol, Harold will first have to oust Rodney Davis, who was narrowly elected to a first term last year. A solid 7 himself, Davis has tons of money but remains vulnerable in a district where he won with the smallest margin of victory of all Republicans in 2012. He's also a white, male, career politician, which makes him as common in the GOP as bad suits. Next to a biracial former Miss America with a Harvard Law degree, a history of social conservatism, and a keen sense of patriotic fashion, he looks like a loser. And on Illinois' 2014 Republican primary night, that's exactly what he'll be.\n}}
{{Last year was a rough one for Big Tech\u2014Congress spent 2018 raking companies like Twitter and Facebook over the coals on topics like political bias and data privacy. Just last month, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing with Google CEO Sundar Pichai to grill him over the same things, as well as Google\u2019s ambitions in China. But the hearing only continued to reveal the troubling level of technical illiteracy in Congress. Lawmakers, asking humorously basic questions about things like how online searches work, maintained the antagonistic tone toward America\u2019s innovators that is sure to get us into deep trouble. Indeed, if the United States is to retain its technological supremacy over China\u2014and other nations capitalizing on emerging technologies\u2014it has to start seeing tech companies as allies, not enemies.\nIt was disappointing to see the House fail to seek Pichai\u2019s expertise on crafting forward-thinking policy during the three and a half hour hearing with Google. When given the chance to work with the company at the forefront of artificial intelligence research and deployment, the House didn\u2019t take it. Instead, it just threatened Google by speaking positively of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\u2014a draconian European Union privacy regulation. Congress failed its constituents by refusing to even try to find a way that Google\u2019s work could advance American interests.\nAs the new year begins, it doesn\u2019t look like Congress\u2019s interest in antagonizing Big Tech will subside. There is draft legislation currently circulating in the Senate, the Consumer Data Protection Act, that models itself off of the GDPR and California\u2019s recent privacy bill. This isn\u2019t a good thing\u2014the law would place severe compliance costs on technology firms, greatly expanding the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) powers and threatening company executives with jail time for privacy violations. Hardly a good balance between privacy and innovation, such a regulatory step would only accelerate the United States\u2019 declining status as the global technology leader.\nThis heavy-handed approach radically differs from developments in China, where technology firms scale quickly\u2014 enabling the country to become a technological superpower. And the Chinese Communist Party recently made clear its ambition of exporting Chinese tech in an effort to become the infrastructure for developing countries and make the world less dependent on American giants. This means that now the Chinese are just using the same smart mechanisms of speedy innovation and open trade that have historically helped America spread its values and economic dominance across the globe.\nChina is investing heavily in Africa, for instance, leading quickly to the adoption of Chinese tech firms across the continent, and National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s recent unveiling of the \u201cProsper Africa\u201d plan. Bolton\u2019s new approach to Africa threatens to reduce trade and aid with those African nations who do business with China and Russia. But this is a move from the wrong foreign policy playbook. That kind of aggression will only stop developing nations from seeing the United States as a crucial partner in their growth\u2014and they may start viewing China as their friend.\nRelated Articles Moving beyond the Trump-Russia story\nQuestion of the Week: What do you think of the Mueller report?\nWeighing the pros and cons of student loan debt relief\nThe hype-deflating Mueller report: Political Cartoons\nCan California close its \u2018achievement gap\u2019? This is where tech moguls could really help America out, but Congress is willfully refusing to let them. Google has published its own privacy regulation framework that seeks to advance the interests of innovators while protecting users, and Microsoft has called for proactive regulation on facial recognition technologies to ensure that they develop in a way that respects individual liberties. Congress\u2019s own privacy legislation is likely to come forth in 2019, and tech competition with China will intensify. If Congress doesn\u2019t listen to what U.S. tech has to say and work alongside those companies that ensure American tech leadership, it\u2019ll be failing America\u2014and the world.\nRyan Khurana is executive director of the Institute for Advancing Prosperity and a Technology Policy Fellow at Young Voices\n}}
{{\u201cIt really is disgusting, if you think about it,\u201d Tim Ryan is saying. The six-foot-four, Italian-Irish Congressman from Ohio is sitting in his office. Behind him is a blown-up photograph of his baby in a \u201cTiny Democrat\u201d onesie. He\u2019s inviting me to come to a hot-yoga class he regularly attends with his staff, but he\u2019s careful not to oversell it. \u201cPeople are sweating everywhere. Dudes are in there with their shirts off. If you\u2019re like a petite, clean woman, next to this beast who\u2019s sweating like \u2026 \u201d He makes a face. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re invited. We\u2019d love to have you.\u201d\nAlmost everyone comes to Capitol Hill to espouse a set of ideas; usually, those ideas fit neatly in the ideological confines of a political party. Ryan\u2019s are a bit different. He\u2019s established himself as Congress\u2019s mindful member, penning books on the power of meditation and what he calls \u201cthe real food revolution,\u201d advocating for yoga, meditation, and unplugging from the internet as a salve to the stresses of modern existence. Think Deepak Chopra meets Michael Pollan, in the body of a former high-school football player turned Democratic Congressman from the Rust Belt. He\u2019s introduced bills to add holistic and alternative-medicine programs for the treatment of veterans, to teach schoolchildren social and emotional skills through better self-awareness, to fund \u201cintegrated nutrition curricula\u201d in medical schools \u2014 and that\u2019s just in the last Congress.\nRelated Stories How Powerful Is the Progressive Revolt Brewing in the House?\nIn 2009, he secured funding for a program that teaches mindfulness at schools in his district; students there instruct each other to take deep breaths when they\u2019re upset, or visit the peace corner to take a break from classroom stress. He\u2019s also trying to introduce his quiet revolution to Capitol Hill, organizing a weekly staff meditation session when Congress is in town, which he estimates is usually attended by 20 to 40 staffers, and a members-only session in the House chapel, which is less well attended. \u201cIt\u2019s usually me and Tony Cardenas from California,\u201d he says, mentioning a fellow House Democrat. But Ryan is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019ve had a number of members say, \u2018I want to come.\u2019\u201d\nRelated Stories How Reihan Salam Became Literary Brooklyn\u2019s Favorite Conservative\nMore recently, Ryan has expanded his holistic congressional practice to include food policy, writing a book this fall on how to get healthier foods on the dinner table \u2014 which is why he\u2019s offered to take me to Safeway after votes. When he goes to vote, he gestures to his cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll put this in my pocket and just walk, try to reconnect. With yoga, it\u2019s the same thing; you take it off the mat. That\u2019s the practice, but are you present when you\u2019re off the mat? That really is the key.\u201d\nTwenty minutes later, he\u2019s finished votes and taken a short drive to a Safeway on Capitol Hill. \u201cIn my family, I do the grocery shopping,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be almost therapeutic. My wife gets so mad \u2014 I\u2019ll go to the grocery store, and it\u2019ll be like two hours. She\u2019s like, \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d\nRyan\u2019s journey to becoming Congress\u2019s crunchiest member began just after his reelection in 2008, when he attended a meditation retreat in the Catskills that ended in 36 hours of total silence. He has always been an overachiever \u2014 he was first elected to the House in 2002, at the age of 29, serves on top committees like budget and appropriations, and is seen as one of the bright, young Democrats that will make up the next generation of House leaders. But after six years in Congress, he could feel himself beginning to get burned out. \u201cLawmakers are so anxious and they need to raise money and there\u2019s all these elections and 24-hour news cycles and Tweeting and blogging and a crisis of every hour,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to contemplate or evaluate and look at what\u2019s happening and why.\u201d\nHe realized that meditation had an effect on him and in so many segments of society, and it was completely free. \u201cI just made the decision that I don\u2019t care what people think. I believed in this; I saw the science. I met the people it was helping. I knew it helped me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I went for it.\u201d So he wrote a book, A Mindful Nation: How a Simple Practice Can Help Us Reduce Stress, Improve Performance, and Recapture the American Spirit, which details how mindfulness can be used in schools, in the health-care system, and with veterans.\nRyan was deep into his mindfulness work, when an unexpected life event helped expand his holistic interests to include food. Just as Ryan and his wife were considering having their third child, his wife came down with a mysterious illness, which her doctor explained was likely caused by a childhood diet of antibiotics and processed foods that had ruined the good bacteria in her gut. The experience turned Ryan into a healthy-food crusader. \u201cThis one\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he says, considering a jar of peanut butter. \u201cNot bad, three grams of sugar.\u201d\nAs much as he loves it, the grocery store is also filled with perils \u2014 that\u2019s one of the takeaways from his second book, which he released in October, The Real Food Revolution: Healthy Eating, Green Groceries, and the Return of the American Family Farm. The book, blurbed by Nestl\u00e9, Bill Clinton, and Arianna Huffington, touches on the big picture, like the farm bill\u2019s favoritism toward large agricultural corporations and subsidies for food items that make us fat, as well as the small, like the steps individual people can take to change the way they eat.\nHe winds his way through the aisles, pausing to scan the sugar content on a box of Fruit Loops, peering over a meat cooler to consider various packages of pale chicken breasts wrapped tightly in cellophane, their meat juices pooling in the corner of their Styrofoam trays. \u201cThis has no hormones or steroids, which is good, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about antibiotics,\u201d he says, moving on. He grabs a few packages of turkey sausage to keep in the fridge of his Capitol Hill office for breakfasts on the go. Then, one of his aides, who\u2019s coming along to do his own shopping, hands him something that really gets him worked up: a Lunchables package.\nRyan takes the package. \u201cDid you ever read Salt Sugar Fat?\u201d he asks, referring to New York Times reporter Michael Moss\u2019s 2013 book about how food companies got Americans addicted to fatty, processed foods. \u201cHe goes through the evolution of the Lunchable, how it started, and then stopped selling, so they added the Oreo and they kept building.\u201d He is speaking at a rapid clip. \u201cOkay, so 34 grams of sugar in this thing. That\u2019s seven or eight teaspoons \u2014 over eight. You\u2019re giving your kid over eight teaspoons, just in this!\u201d He waves the package around, which looks even smaller in his large hands. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re having the Fruit Loops for breakfast, you probably have one and a half to two cups. So now you\u2019re at six, plus the milk, plus more if you have an orange juice. Then this for lunch. Do that for seven or eight years and you\u2019ll be diabetic!\u201d And yet, he says, it\u2019s hard to see all of that when you\u2019re a busy parent trying to work and put your kids through school and make sure they eat \u2014 especially when money\u2019s tight and the crappy food is cheap.\nRyan and his wife have three kids, Mason, Bella, and Brady. For the older two, he and his wife pack healthy lunches: hard-boiled eggs, baba ghanoush or hummus with veggies, soup in Thermoses, and occasionally some slices of turkey, rolled without no bread. The kids haven\u2019t totally gotten with Dad\u2019s program yet, though. \u201cMy young son didn\u2019t get the memo on my meditation practice. He\u2019s 7 months old; I\u2019m just starting to get back into a daily routine,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cBrady threw up on my books.\u201d Ryan seemed pretty Zen about it. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll text you about yoga,\u201d he says, stepping forward to embrace me in a bro hug. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely do yoga!\u201d\n}}

{{A safe, modern and efficient transportation system is critical to the economic success of our nation. Yet, policymakers in Washington have had their heads in the sand for years while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Our roads are clogged with traffic, our trains and buses are filled to capacity and our skies are approaching gridlock.\nThis has been happening all over the country, including in Utah. But then again, you probably already knew that. Forty-four percent of Utah\u2019s urban interstates are congested during peak travel times, and 30 percent of the state\u2019s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. But were you aware that driving on mediocre roads in Utah costs the average driver $287 in repairs and operating costs each year? It\u2019s no wonder that the American Society of Civil Engineers graded Utah\u2019s infrastructure a C+.\nIn some respects, Utah is ahead of the game, as America\u2019s infrastructure fared much worse at a D+. Your state has started to take action by investing more in your infrastructure. But at the national level, our policymakers have not been serious about a long-term infrastructure strategy. As a result, America has been falling apart and falling behind our global economic competitors. In 2005, the World Economic Forum rated the competitiveness of America\u2019s infrastructure No. 1. Today, we have fallen to No. 9 behind France and the Netherlands.\nSince the 1950s, our roads, bridges and transit have been funded by the users of the system through an 18.4 cent federal fuel tax. But this once reliable source of funding is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of a 21st-century transportation system. While there are more cars on the road than ever before, they are also more fuel-efficient, using less or no gas and generating smaller revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. Coupled with the fact that the fuel tax has not kept up with inflation and has not increased since 1993, the Highway Trust Fund is in danger of running out of money in 2020.\nThink about that. The cost of everything has gone up since 1993. Imagine trying to get by today on the same salary you earned in 1993. That is the woeful state of the Highway Trust Fund. The years of kicking the can down the road must end.\nCongress can address this issue sooner than later by tying infrastructure to the tax reform proposal that will be making its way through Congress in the weeks ahead. We are suggesting two ways to provide a long-term and sustainable solution to the Highway Trust Fund. The first is through an immediate cash infusion. An estimated $2 trillion in corporate earnings from American companies are currently stashed overseas and sheltered from U.S. taxes. Let\u2019s bring that cash back home by incentivizing companies to repatriate these funds at a much lower tax rate than the current 35 percent corporate tax rate and directing a substantial portion of those funds to the Highway Trust Fund or an Infrastructure Bank.\nWhile this immediate cash infusion is directed to rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s also modernize the federal fuel tax by a modest 10 cents and tie it to inflation. Ultimately, the fuel tax is likely to be phased out in several years as technology will make it possible to transition to a system based on the number of miles driven by users. This would ensure that all users of the system pay their part, including the growing number of hybrid and electric vehicles that use little or no gas. This concept is already being studied and tested in several states, including Oregon and California.\nOver the past 30 years, all revenue increases for the Highway Trust Fund have been included in tax or deficit reduction legislation. As former elected officials, we fully understand the difficult politics of raising revenue. But by tying infrastructure to tax reform, any increase in the fuel tax would be more than offset by the amount of a middle-class tax cut. Over 250 bipartisan members of Congress agree, which is why they recently sent a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee asking that a long-term fix for the Highway Trust Fund be included in a tax package.\nIt\u2019s past time for serious action to revitalize America\u2019s infrastructure. Congress must link tax reform and infrastructure, and provide a permanent fix to the Highway Trust Fund.\n}}
{{Most presidents want to forget about the campaign promises that don\u2019t exactly work out. And they certainly don\u2019t make them a central feature of the State of the Union address.\nIndeed, on Wednesday night President Obama did not mention the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp, a symbol of the US approach to the war on terror that damaged America\u2019s global image and which he had pledged to close by this month. At this point, no one knows when Guant\u00e1namo will close.\nBut strikingly, Mr. Obama did devote a significant portion of his first State of the Union speech to his campaign promise to launch a postpartisan era in Washington. That pledge crumbled as the new president, bolstered by large Democratic majorities in Congress and facing a recalcitrant Republican minority, sought to enact an ambitious agenda.\nLet\u2019s try again, Obama essentially said, amid his larger message that jobs and the economy are his top priority.\n\u201cI will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern. \u201c\nAnyone who follows politics knows that \u201clast week\u201d referred to the upset election of a Republican to the Massachusetts Senate seat of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Voters there said they wanted to send a \u201cmessage\u201d to Washington: We still want change.\nIn his speech Wednesday, Obama sought to reseize the change mantle, and pushed back on the notion that he was na\u00efve to think he could change the way Washington works.\n\u201cNow, I'm not na\u00efve,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and some postpartisan era.\u201d\nObama blamed both parties for feeding divisions that are \u201cdeeply entrenched\u201d and pointed out that philosophical differences represent the essence of democracy.\n\u201cBut what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side \u2013 a belief that if you lose, I win.\u201d\nObama promised to renew his efforts to reach out to Republicans, noting that this week he is addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. He suggested monthly meetings with the Democratic and Republican leadership.\n\u201cI know you can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said to laughter as he glanced at the Republican side of the House chamber.\nUntil last week\u2019s Massachusetts shocker, Obama\u2019s first State of the Union was to be a different affair. He expected to have finished comprehensive healthcare reform \u2013 if not signed, at least passed in its final version through both houses of Congress. Healthcare was to be the crowning achievement of Obama\u2019s first year in office, and in the State of the Union address, he was going to start the selling process \u2013 explaining to a skeptical public what it would do for them.\nThe loss of the Massachusetts seat meant the loss of the Democrats\u2019 60-seat supermajority in the Senate, the number of votes needed to halt a filibuster.\nSo instead, a chastened Obama went before the joint session of Congress and the American people, and accepted blame. He acknowledged how the complexity of the reform had made Americans increasingly skeptical.\n\u201cI take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people,\u201d Obama said.\nBut he also chastised congressional Democrats for their behavior since the Jan. 19 election loss.\n\u201cTo Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills,\u201d he said.\nThen he turned to the Republicans with a similar scolding message: \u201cJust saying no\u201d is not leadership, he said.\nWhether Obama\u2019s cajoling can begin to move Washington beyond its partisan ways, even an inch, is open to debate. But with each passing day, as the clock ticks toward the November midterms, it will be increasingly difficult.\nObama has not given up on his ambitious agenda, but as the new political calculus settles in, that may change. In the meantime, he used fighting words to set the tone for his larger vision of a strong union: \u201cI don\u2019t quit.\u201d\n----\nFollow us on Twitter.\n}}
{{Testifying before the US Senate Committee on Armed Services on Thursday, Pentagon officials claimed that \u201cwar on terror\u201d legislation gives them sweeping powers to wage war anywhere in the world, including inside the United States, without Congressional authorization.\nAssistant Defense Secretary Michael Sheehan argued that the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks, constituted effective Congressional authorization for future wars waged under the rubric of the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d In his view, the Pentagon can continue its global campaign of drone assassination strikes and launch further wars under the heading of the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d without renewed authorization from Congress.Donate\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re comfortable with the AUMF as it is currently structured,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cRight now \u2026 it serves its purpose.\u201d\nSheehan made clear that he believed that this authorization of war extended into the indefinite future. He said, \u201cIn my judgment, this is going to go on for quite a while, yes, beyond the second term of the president \u2026 I think it\u2019s at least 10 to 20 years.\u201d\nSheehan\u2019s position represents a flagrant rejection of the US Constitution. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution specifies: \u201cThe Congress shall have power \u2026 to declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\u201d However, top Pentagon officials are effectively asserting that Congress\u2019 power will be indefinitely superseded by the President and the military, which can launch limitless wars at will.\nWhile the issue is publicly presented as a debate over revising the AUMF, powerful sections of the American ruling class are in fact moving to suspend key provisions of the US Constitution and install a presidential-military dictatorship. In response to questioning from friendly Senators, the Pentagon officials indicated that they believe the AUMF allows the executive to unilaterally invade other countries and wage war inside the United States.\nSenator Lindsey Graham asked whether the current AUMF gave US President Barack Obama the authority to put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Yemen in the Middle East, or the Congo in Africa. The Pentagon\u2019s acting general counsel, Robert Taylor, said that it did.\n\u201cWould you agree with me, the battlefield is anywhere the enemy chooses to make it?\u201d Graham asked.\nSheehan replied, \u201cYes sir, from Boston to FATA,\u201d\u2013referring to Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a key target of US drone strikes, and the decision to put the entire city of Boston on lockdown after the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings.\nIn his prepared testimony, moreover, Sheehan wrote that \u201cbeing a US citizen does not immunize a member of the enemy from attack\u201d by US forces. With this comment, Sheehan was again aligning the Pentagon with the US drone assassination of Anwar al-Awlaqi, a US citizen, on September 30, 2011. Washington gave no evidence that Awlaqi was planning or executing any attack on the United States before murdering him with a Hellfire missile.\nThis follows public speculation earlier this year by US Attorney General Eric Holder about possibly extra-judicially murdering US citizens on US soil, during counter-terrorism operations.\nThe entire framework of the Senate hearing testified to the deep decay of American democracy. The AUMF itself is an anti-democratic document, authorizing the President to use force against any \u201cnations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations.\u201d\nWhile the AUMF was cynically presented as being directed against Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, Washington took it as a blank check to wage unpopular wars and order assassinations throughout the world.\nThis pretext was fundamentally fraudulent, in that these policies were not primarily directed at Al Qaeda. They aimed to install neo-colonial rule in the Middle East, where most countries played no role in launching the September 11 attacks, in order to seize control of key oil resources and strengthen Washington\u2019s geo-strategic position vis-\u00e0-vis other major powers. They also were aimed at suppressing popular opposition to such policies in the American working class by installing a climate of fear and intimidation.\nThe shifting needs of US imperialist policy over the last 12 years have exploded the pretext that its wars are justified by the AUMF. Many Al Qaeda-affiliated groups Washington is attacking, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb or Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, did not exist in 2001 and played no role in the September 11 attacks. Washington even uses others, such as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group or the Al Nusra Front in Syria, as allies of convenience in its wars for regime change in these countries.\nThe Pentagon has responded by asserting that the AUMF also grants it the authority to wage war on \u201cassociated forces,\u201d referring to Al Qaeda, though the term does not appear in the text of the AUMF. This provoked questions and even certain criticisms from the Senators.\nSenator Angus King noted, \u201cYou guys have essentially rewritten the Constitution here \u2026 You guys have invented this term, associated forces, and it renders the war powers of Congress null and void.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m just a little old lawyer from Brunswick, Maine, but I don\u2019t see how you can possibly read this to be in comport with the Constitution.\u201d\nSenator John McCain said that, when the Senate voted for the AUMF in 2001, \u201cNone of us could have envisioned [granting] authority [for war] in Yemen and Somalia \u2026 For you to come here and say we don\u2019t need to change [the AUMF] or revise it, I think is, well, disturbing.\u201d\nSenator Joe Donnelly raised Al Nusra in the Senate hearing and asked whether by affiliating to Al Qaeda\u2013as Al Nusra has done\u2013a group automatically could be considered a threat to the United States.\nSheehan replied, \u201cYes sir, although it\u2019s a bit murky, I hate to say, because there are groups that have openly professed their affiliation with Al Qaeda yet, in fact, as a government we haven\u2019t completely grappled with that as of now.\u201d\nNonetheless, all the Senators stressed their basic agreement with the fraudulent framework of the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d King stressed, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree that we need to fight terrorism.\u201d\nMcCain told the Pentagon officials, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you because basically you\u2019ve got carte blanche as to what you are going to do around the world.\u201d\nThese comments expose the political reality that the only constituency for democracy in the United States is to be found in the working class. Even as the AUMF and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d are publicly exposed as pretexts for the US military to unconstitutionally seize immense powers, the political establishment continues to support the Pentagon, in order to further the strategic interests of US imperialism.\n}}

{{Sunday signaled the completion of a major milestone: the end of the first round of negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Canada, Mexico and the US are set to meet over multiple rounds in the coming months.\nToo frequently I have heard the mantra \u201cdo no harm\u201d from industry leaders as they encourage Donald Trump\u2019s negotiations. I take a different stand, as I have since Nafta was signed into law 23 years ago. This is an opportunity to do right by workers across the continent. This moment must not be squandered by pandering to transnational special interests. Some of us in Congress, and many workers throughout our heartland, have been waiting for this moment for years.\nCanada v Mexico: Trump seeks to divide and conquer in Nafta negotiations Read more\nWorkers in the midwest cite trade, and Nafta in particular, as a top reason they supported Trump\u2019s candidacy. In my district in northern Ohio this past election, Trump flipped two historically Democratic counties and almost won a third, Lorain, which voted for Hillary Clinton by the smallest of margins. It is no coincidence that his message on ripping up Nafta resonated with workers hardest hit by the export of hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\nIn his opening salvo, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, correctly emphasized that the deal had \u201cfailed many, many Americans and needs major improvement\u201d. To fulfill these goals there will need to be major changes, not simple tweaks. America needs a continental compact that lifts workers on all sides of the border, raises wages and balances US trade accounts.\nTrade agreements are highly complex documents. Their benefits to investors can be quantified; by contrast, their costs to workers are acute and cruel if not done right. Think of communities in the midwest ravaged by the loss of manufacturing jobs. Ohio alone lost about 35,000 jobs to Mexico. In rural Mexico, nearly a million farm jobs were lost as imports decimated local economies and forced economic migration as people became desperate for opportunity.\nSome economists and some of my colleagues suggest deficits are a healthy aspect of trade agreements, citing mighty American buying power as a singular point of success. That is a distorted view. Mammoth deficits are not beneficial when the job loss behind the imbalance creates seismic economic and cultural pressures. The trade deficit can even limit GDP growth as huge trade deficits can create slow growth economies.\nJust in June, the US experienced a $43.6bn trade deficit. These deficits mean more money left the wallets of hardworking Americans to feed the greed of rapacious, low-wage seeking transnational interests. Just look at Nafta\u2019s job numbers: between 1997 and 2010, the US bled 682,900 jobs to Mexico.\nTo help remedy this, Lighthizer should adopt the concept of my bill, the Balancing Trade Act (HR 2766), as a fundamental stance of US trade policy. It requires the administration adjust policy with any nation accumulating a trade deficit of $10bn or more for three consecutive years. Alternatively, Congress should pass and the president should sign this bill as part of our commitment to lowering trade deficits.\nThere is no doubt that the US economy possesses unparalleled buying power, but trade is about workers, not just goods. Imagine if North America negotiated a deal that lifted the standard of living of workers and local economies by granting increased buying power for US goods?\nNearly three decades ago, we were told Nafta was the epitome of a modern trade agreement. Supporters assured job growth, increased economic flexibility for North American industries and new buyers for American goods. The Nafta trade model simply has not lived up to those promises. Wages in Mexico and the US have stagnated or declined since Nafta, and working conditions have worsened.\nThis time around, workers in all three countries need truly enforceable provisions that protect their right to organize, work in safe environments and earn livable wages. Enforcement must come with a mechanism for investigation and remediation when violations of wage and working conditions violate the spirit of the agreement.\nNafta is not an ethereal idea about trade policy and goods. It is about people, jobs and how much money goes into the paychecks of workers across the continent.\nThe US economy and global corporations can surely benefit from international trade agreements, but that is not enough. Our trade negotiators\u2019 top priority must be the US worker and promoting fair rather than just free trade. In doing so, the continent will achieve a compact for democratic development across North America.\nCongresswoman Marcy Kaptur represents Ohio\u2019s ninth district and is the dean of the Ohio congressional delegation.

{{To the Senate:\nAmerican workers need jobs. You have the opportunity to create or save at least a million jobs through the American Jobs Act of 2011. The members of the Coalition on Human Needs urge you to vote to move this legislation forward and to enact it as quickly as possible.\nThe nearly 26 million unemployed and underemployed need you to act. So do the tens of millions of Americans anxious about whether they will be laid off, increasingly unable to make ends meet, and fearful for their children's future. They need protection and opportunity. September's unemployment rate, stuck at 9.1 percent, confirms how urgent it is that you use the power of the federal government to provide both.\nPresident Obama's American Jobs Act, as introduced in the Senate by Majority Leader Reid, will protect against the devastation caused by joblessness, both by preventing some job loss and by sustaining families when unemployment occurs. Continuation of the federal program of unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed is essential protection. Provisions to retain or hire teachers and public safety workers protect jobs. The payroll tax cut for employees will add $179 billion to households across the nation, helping them to buy what they need and infusing income into businesses that need customers.\nThe American Jobs Act offers opportunity as well, by investing in job creation by modernizing transportation and schools, by renovating foreclosed and blighted properties in low-income communities, and by targeting jobs and training to people who need it most.\nMany provisions in this legislation target the job creation to long-term unemployed and low-income people and communities. We strongly support the components in the Pathways Back to Work section, including summer and year-round employment programs for youth ($1.5 billion), subsidized temporary jobs for low-income workers ($2 billion), and grants to local entities for work-based training ($1.5 billion). We also favor the use of unemployment compensation funds to subsidize wages when businesses institute job-sharing plans in lieu of lay-offs. Targeted assistance to help veterans find employment is an important part of this legislation. September's unemployment report shows an alarming rise in joblessness among our newest veterans, jumping from 9.2 percent to 14.7 percent over the past year. They deserve better, and you must not delay the help that the American Jobs Act can provide.\nThe bill before you offsets the cost of these job creation measures by applying a 5.6 percent surtax on annual income in excess of $1 million, beginning in 2013. We believe that top income individuals and profit-rich corporations should contribute more than this as you take up the larger deficit reduction package. But we strongly support the surtax as a fair source of revenue and a significant first step towards redressing the unfairness of plummeting average tax rates for the wealthiest 1 percent. Since 1979, the average tax rate for the richest 1 percent of households fell by more than one-fifth (from 37 percent to 29.5 percent of income), according to the Economic Policy Institute. The overall average tax rate declined only slightly (from 22.2 percent to 20.4 percent over the same period). Citizens for Tax Justice analyzed the impact of the millionaires' surtax and found that only two-tenths of 1 percent (0.2 percent) of taxpayers would pay it, and that in only one state would as much as 1 percent of its population be subject to the tax (Connecticut).\nPlease do not be fooled by those who assert that this surtax will hurt small businesses. According to the Treasury Department, only 1 percent of small businesses earn $1 million or more. That means 99 percent do not, and will not pay this tax.\nIncome for the wealthiest Americans has soared while their tax rates have shrunk. This has meant a surge in inequality that hurts us as a nation. We must not continue to fire teachers when we know that people who do not finish high school have a 14 percent unemployment rate. The American Jobs Act recoups a small fraction of the fortune that has been bestowed upon the very richest among us, so that more of us can succeed and our economy can recover. We urge you to vote for it.\n}}

{{Some Members of Congress claimed to have \"buyer's remorse\" the day after they voted overwhelmingly to override the President's veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, otherwise known as the \"Saudi 9/11 bill.\" The vote was 97-1 in the Senate, and 348-77 in the House, a 4-1 margin (a 2-1 margin was necessary to override.)\nThe preposterous claim now from the Saudi appeasers is that they didn't realize before voting that some people claimed that the law might have a negative impact on some Americans. Some people had claimed that if we weaken the sacred principle of sovereign immunity, other countries might do the same, and some Americans could face broad new liabilities in foreign courts. Some people had claimed that the veto override would lead to horrible retaliation by Saudi Arabia - by selling assets in the U.S., or by refusing to purchase U.S. weapons, for example.\nHere are five reasons that these \"buyer's remorse\" claims are nonsense.\nFirst, all the claims about possible harm from the bill were fully aired by the Administration and the Saudi lobby before the vote to override the veto. These people now claiming that they had no idea that there were claims that passage of the bill could eventually expose some Americans to increased legal liability overseas or that Saudi Arabia might retaliate should swear it under oath. Or maybe they should just resign their seats immediately, if they're too stupid to do their jobs or too lazy to come up with a more plausible lie.\nSecond, as was pointed out repeatedly during the Congressional debate on the veto override that these Saudi-appeasing Members of Congress apparently missed, there are already exceptions to sovereign immunity in U.S. law. One of these exceptions is for terrorism. The Saudi 9/11 bill did not create a new exception to sovereign immunity in U.S. law. It simply expanded the existing terrorism exception. The status quo was that you could only sue countries that were on the State Department's \"state sponsors of terrorism\" list. Now that the Saudi 9/11 bill is law, you can sue Saudi Arabia over terrorism even though Saudi Arabia isn't on the State Department's list. The Establishment is having a coronary because the 9/11 families broke the State Department's monopoly on who can be called a \"state sponsor of terrorism,\" which monopoly was useful to the Establishment for other purposes. Cry me a river.\nThird, anyone who honestly thinks that the dispute over the Saudi 9/11 bill has anything to do with the prospect of U.S. soldiers being hauled in front of Iraqi courts must have slept through the (ongoing) debate over the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, which hinges on the question of immunity for U.S. troops in Iraqi courts. Here is a recent example. For our purposes here, it doesn't matter who is right in the 2011 Iraq withdrawal dispute. What matters here is that both sides of 2011 Iraq withdrawal dispute - that is, both wings of the Establishment - are so unconcerned about the prospect that U.S. soldiers will be hauled in front of Iraqi courts that they are content to keep thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq right now on the basis of a diplomatic note, with no action to immunize those troops from liability by the Iraqi parliament. Any Member of Congress who has any doubt about this should be calling for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq unless their immunity from Iraqi courts is clarified. The fact that no-one is doing this shows how fraudulent the claim is that the dispute over the Saudi 9/11 bill has something to do with U.S. troops in Iraq today. When U.S. troops are stationed in another country with that country's permission, the question of legal immunity for the troops is governed by the agreement to station the troops there.\nFourth, there is the question of threatened Saudi retaliation. The Saudis' very expensive lobbying operation in Washington huffed and puffed and threatened that there was going to be big retaliation if Congress overrode the veto. Congress overrode the veto anyway. Where's the big retaliation?\nOne of the threats was that the Saudis would sell their assets in the U.S. Here's some cold water for that threat.\nAnother threat was that the Saudis would stop buying U.S. weapons. Here's some cold water for that threat.\nFinally, there is the question: how does the \"buyer's remorse\" crowd propose to modify the bill? During a lame duck session of Congress after the election - when, they hope, Members of Congress won't be so afraid of public opinion - they propose to limit the bill to 9/11.\nA key problem with that plan is that it has already been considered and rejected by the 9/11 families. And the reason is simple: it's not about the past, it's about the future. They're trying to ensure that the State Department can't hand out \"get out of jail free\" cards to purported U.S. \"allies\" like Saudi Arabia in the future. They hope that in the future, nobody else will have to experience what they've experienced, and that's why they don't want to limit the law to 9/11.\nThe 9/11 families didn't let the Saudi appeasers in Congress roll them before, when they needed two-thirds of both Houses to take their side to override the veto. Why would they let the Saudi appeasers in Congress roll them now, when they only need 41 Senators to protect the law?\n}}
{{Rarely a day goes by without an exciting new twist in The Russian Connection, the John Le Carr\u00e9 novel none of us signed up for. This has left something of an impression on the American people, at least according to a CNN poll out today, which shows 55 percent of us are somewhat or very concerned about the allegations. Perhaps more to the point, fully 65 percent want Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to follow the trail rather than investigate it themselves. That number even includes 46 percent of Republican respondents.\nThe results should bolster the already strong case for an independent figure to lead the investigation.

Sessions has since recused himself from any campaign-related investigations.\nHouse Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes, for instance, was enlisted by the Trump White House to quash news reports of meetings between Trump associates and the Russians\u2014despite the fact his committee was simultaneously tasked with investigating the reports. Nunes agreed to spin for the executive branch, then told reporters he didn't see any conflict. Meanwhile, House Oversight chairman Jason Chaffetz has repeatedly deferred to Nunes' committee to conduct any potential investigation, reinforcing the notion that Chaffetz isn't particularly interested in providing oversight of anyone with an (R) near their name.\n(Meanwhile, Nunes, who warned against a \"witch hunt\" on the Russian issue last week while adding \"we still don't have any evidence of them talking to Russia,\" has already announced he will investigate the president's baseless 5 a.m. claims that President Obama tapped his phones during the campaign.)\nGetty Images\nHowever, there are Republicans in Congress who are at least talking a good game. Darrell Issa acceded to the idea of a special prosecutor on Real Time with Bill Maher, then promptly backtracked. In a CNN town hall last week, Senator Lindsey Graham said that \"if there is something there\" in terms of criminal charges, \"then for sure you need a special prosecutor.\" In a New York Magazine profile last month, mythical maverick John McCain made noises about a special Congressional committee to look into the matter, \"which could ultimately put pressure on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor.\" So far McCain's opposition to Trump has been more talk than action, however.\nWhile the special prosecutor crowd has more ammo with today's report\u2014just 32 percent of respondents said Congress was capable of handling the investigation on its own\u2014it's not all bad news in Trumpworld. His approval rating remains steady at a miraculous 45 percent, according to CNN, while 54 percent of Trump's Republican base has no concerns \"at all\" about the allegations. When you consider that Trump voters' support for Vladimir Putin has jumped to 35 percent\u201426 points higher than their approval of President Obama\u2014that's not all that surprising. That lines up with CNN's results, which see Democrats and Republicans switching places in terms of who views Russia as a serious threat. Democrats, at 51 percent, are about twice as likely to consider Putin's oligarchic paradise a \"very serious threat.\" Whatever happened to country over party?\n}}
{{LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen detained since last month in Vietnam should be allowed to return home to California, a U.S. Congresswoman and the man\u2019s family said on Thursday.\nThe family had learned from U.S. officials that Michael Phuong Minh Nguyen, 54, was being held in Ho Chi Minh City, his brother-in-law, Mark Roberts, told a news conference in Orange County, California.\nNguyen is under investigation for suspected activity against the Vietnamese government, but has not formally been charged with any crime, Roberts said.\nNguyen, who was born in Vietnam and has lived in the United States since he was a child, was not known to be politically active and spends his time in California raising four daughters and running a printing business, his family said.\nHis fate threatens to become a diplomatic sore point between the United States and Vietnam.\nCommunist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little criticism and in recent months has been carrying out a crackdown on dissent and stepping up arrests of activists.\nCongresswoman Mimi Walters, a Republican who represents Orange County, where Nguyen lives, told reporters she would meet with the Vietnamese ambassador in Washington on Friday.\n\u201cThe Vietnamese government needs to know that there will be consequences if they don\u2019t treat American citizens with respect,\u201d Walters said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to make sure we bring Mr Nguyen home.\u201d\nA representative for the Vietnamese embassy did not immediately return calls.\nNguyen\u2019s case has stirred outrage in Orange County, which is home to a large population of Vietnamese-Americans who fled as refugees during or soon after the U.S. war in Vietnam ended in 1975.\nOrange County is home to the Provisional National Government of Vietnam, an exile group opposed to the government in Hanoi.\nNguyen was not involved with any organizations other than his Catholic church, his sister-in-law, Christine Nguyen, 40, told Reuters in a phone interview.\nMichael Nguyen flew to Vietnam on June 27 to visit friends while his wife, Helen, stayed in California with the couple\u2019s children, Roberts said. Helen, who works as a nurse, was last in contact with her husband on July 5.\nThis week, after frantic appeals for information, Nguyen\u2019s family learned from U.S. officials that he had been detained, Roberts said, adding that they had been told that U.S. officials had met with Nguyen.\nWhen asked about Nguyen at a news conference on Thursday in Hanoi, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said her office would \u201cask the relevant authorities.\u201d\nAfter another Vietnamese-American was detained in the Southeast Asian country during nationwide protests in June, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked for a speedy resolution to the case.

{{TEN KILLED. Nine high school students and one teacher were murdered, while 10 remain injured as of press time at Santa Fe High School in Texas on the morning of Friday, May 20, after a gunman opened fire. This comes just a little more than three months after the Valentine\u2019s Day school massacre in Parkland, Florida.\nThe suspect was identified by the Galveston County sheriff as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old student of the same school in Santa Fe, and is now being held without bond on a capital murder charge.\nAccording to the report by the New York Times, the suspect appeared to have obtained a shotgun and a .38 revolver from his father, who legally owned them, the authorities said.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis had not come to the attention of the authorities before, but what could perhaps be the most menacing sign of trouble was perhaps a shirt, included on Mr. Pagourtzis\u2019s Facebook page, that read \u2018born to kill.\u201d There were reportedly no indications that the teen had a criminal record or any history with law enforcement.\nOn Friday, the Santa Fe Independent School District stated on Twitter that \u201cexplosive devices\u201d had been found both on the campus and in surrounding areas. State officials said at a news conference that different types of explosive devices had been identified elsewhere as well.\nThis tragedy is the 22nd school shooting this year alone, after a string of so many other mass shootings that has rocked this nation to its core, with people asking: WHEN WILL THIS END?\nIn his public remarks on the Santa Fe shooting, President Donald Trump said on Friday, \u201cThis has been going on too long in our country. Too many years. Too many decades now.\u201d\n\u201cWe grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support to everyone affected by this absolutely horrific attack,\u201d he said.\nAs CNN reported that on Friday afternoon, Trump ordered flags at half-staff in memory of the victims \u201cof the terrible act of violence.\u201d\n\u201cOur Nation grieves with those affected by the shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas,\u201d Trump said in a proclamation with the order. \u201cMay God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims\u2019 families.\u201d\nBLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, Mr. President. Blood on the hands of the men and women in Congress who have not enacted any sensible stricter gun laws since the Parkland School massacre.\nNo sensible gun laws have been signed into law despite the drama and theatrics in the White House when Trump had a \u201clistening session\u201d with the victims of so many mass shootings in America.\nNo stricter gun laws and regulations have been legislated even after Trump told the lawmakers not to be afraid of the powerful National Rifle Association and just craft stricter gun control laws to save lives, especially those of the young innocent children and innocent civilians\u2026not even after the protests, rallies, and clamor of the American people.\nThe National Rifle Association \u2014 with its money, power and influence over Trump and the Republicans in Congress who have been ignoring the call and will of the majority of the American people, including those of responsible gunners and Republicans \u2014 have won again over the safety and protection of this nation.\n* * *\nGel Santos Relos is the anchor of TFC\u2019s \u201cBalitang America.\u201d Views and opinions expressed by the author in this column are solely those of the author and not of Asian Journal and ABS-CBN-TFC.

{{Repealing major Obamacare provisions without a replacement plan in place would quickly strip 18 million Americans of their insurance and cause premiums to skyrocket, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday.\nThe number of uninsured people could climb to 32 million by 2026, the report from the nonpartisan office said. Premiums, which would rise by up to 25% initially, would double by 2026.\nThough the bill the CBO studied is no longer in play, the findings lay out the daunting challenge Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump have ahead as they seek to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act. A growing chorus of lawmakers and health care industry experts have demanded to see leaders\u2019 replacement plans before Congress votes to repeal major parts of the law.\nThe report, prepared at the request of Democratic congressional leaders, looked at the 2015 Republican legislation that repealed Obamacare\u2019s coverage mandates, taxes, subsidies and Medicaid expansion, but did not include replacement plan. That bill was vetoed by President Barack Obama.\nDemocrats quickly jumped on the report, saying the GOP plan will hurt Americans and raise health care costs.\n\u201cThe numbers are even worse than experts could have imagined: tens of millions will lose their health insurance, and individuals will see their premiums double,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nRepublicans said the CBO report is based on legislation that is no longer on the table and ignores the work on a replacement plan.\n\u201cThis report assumes a situation that simply doesn\u2019t exist and that no one in Congress advocates,\u201d said David Popp, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\u201cAnd after years of devastating news about the consequences of Obamacare, I can see why Democrats would want to change the subject,\u201d Popp added. \u201cBut Democrats face a choice now: Do they agree with their Leader and refuse to work together on any reforms at all? Or do they agree with us that doing nothing is not an option, and work with us on a series of step-by-step reforms to prevent the scenario envisioned by the CBO report.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan also blasted the report.\n\u201cThis projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare,\u201d said AshLee Strong, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman.\nRepublicans have been struggling to unify around a repeal and replacement plan, even as they have already kicked off the process of dismantling President Obama\u2019s landmark health reform law. The House on Friday followed the Senate in approving a budget resolution that would repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act. Committees in both chambers will now work out the details of repealing and replacing the law.\n}}
{{That take has convinced voters like Jessica Drake, a 41-year-old military wife who has four children and owes more than $80,000 in student debt. Her husband will retire from the Air Force at the end of the year, and the stay-at-home-mom who tried going back to school in her 30s is stressing about her family\u2019s health care coverage.\n\u201cI tried to educate myself, and here I am, stuck,\u201d she said at an event with Jones at Memo\u2019s Restaurant in Del Rio.\nDrake has another reason for supporting Jones. Earlier this year, one of her daughter\u2019s friends told her mother she was gay. It didn\u2019t go over well. But Jones became an inspiration to the girl.\n\u201cShe\u2019s authentic,\u201d Drake said. \u201cShe really cares.\u201d\nJones has publicly discussed how difficult it was to tell her mother she was gay. She also served in the Air Force under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d which barred openly gay people from serving in the military.\nJones said she doesn\u2019t shy away from being a member of the LGBT community \u2014 she recently was the grand marshal of the Eagle Pass Pride Parade.\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to dwell on it, either. When she meets potential voters, she tells them about her plans to require universal background checks for all gun purchases, do away with donations from corporate political action committees and improve internet speed in rural areas.\n\u201cI think talking about who we want to be as a district, as a state, as a country, that\u2019s what people want to hear about,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot.\u201d\nBorder, a big issue\nMany residents of the district, which shares an 800-mile border with Mexico, say border security is their top issue. Many live within miles of the Rio Grande and work for the federal agencies tasked with holding the line.\nAt a campaign stop, Esther Chapoy says she\u2019s worried about the \u201cporous\u201d border. As a retiree from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and an independent voter, she says she isn\u2019t impressed by Jones\u2019 ideas on how to stop illegal immigration.\nJones wants to provide a path for citizenship to immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. She also wants to invest in the State Department to help countries in Central and South America so that immigrants don\u2019t come running for our border. She doesn\u2019t support a wall, like the president has suggested, or Hurd\u2019s plan to beef up technology at the border.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have smart kids than a smart wall,\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not [about] a wall or no wall, but how else can I spend $25 billion?\u201d\nMark Jones, the political scientist, said people in the district are concerned about the border because they have to bear the consequences of \u201cextreme policies on both sides.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re a group of people who agree more with Will Hurd on border security than Trump on the right and than Gina Ortiz Jones on the left,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want a secure border, but one where people can cross and do business and visit relatives.\u201d\nHurd has also worked to nullify one of Jones\u2019 biggest strengths, her military experience, by claiming she supports Base Realignment and Closure, which could lead to closing military bases. The district is still feeling the effects of closing San Antonio\u2019s Kelly Air Force Base in 2001.\nJones says that was an attack lobbed at her by her primary opponents and Hurd is misleading people because he doesn\u2019t want to talk about his own record.\n\u201cI was very clear about that,\u201d she tells a woman who stops her at the football game. \u201cI\u2019m against closing any more bases.\u201d\nThough the challenges are steep, Jones is convinced she\u2019s headed toward victory. She keeps moving. There are more voters to convince. She thinks back to her time in the Air Force and as a national security expert.\n\u201cIt was always about, what can you do at the end of the day?\u201d Jones says. \u201cThat\u2019s what has allowed me to be successful, and I think that\u2019s what voters want to hear: \u2018What are you going to do for us?\u2019 \u201d\n}}
{{WASHINGTON \u2014 It took a near-miraculous confluence of factors for a pro-choice Democrat to win the state of Alabama \u2014 but it happened. The ruby-red Republican state delivered a stunning result to elect Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate.\nLast time Democrats didn\u2019t even mount a campaign. A write-in Democratic candidate lost to Jeff Sessions by a nearly inconceivable margin of almost 95 per cent, and this time the party won by 1.5 per cent.\nHere are six ways this reshapes American politics.\n1\u2013 Passing bills just got harder for the GOP. Republicans will hold just a one-vote majority in the Senate. That means their legislation can be more easily defeated, and their judicial appointments rejected. All it takes is for two Republicans to defect, instead of the current three. This gives Republican moderates like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski quasi-veto power on everything. Aware of this, the parties scrambled Wednesday over the timing of a major vote on taxes: Republicans rushed to pass a bill this year, ignoring a demand from Democrats that they pause for a few weeks so the newly elected senator can be sworn in.\n2\u2013 Republican infighting. The GOP has been a tinderbox of internal tension, and this is one more spark. Recriminations began before votes were even counted. The party establishment swiftly blamed the nationalist, alt-right wing for elevating controversial candidates like Roy Moore. It was party insurgents who propelled the gay-bashing, anti-Muslim, accused one-time molester of adolescents to the nomination. A close confidant of congressional leader Mitch McConnell pointed this out, while counting was still underway Tuesday. Josh Holmes tweeted: \u201cI\u2019d just like to thank Steve Bannon for showing us how to lose the reddest state in the union.\u201d GOP lawmaker Peter King put it more crudely, on CNN: \u201c(Bannon) guy does not belong on the national stage. He looks like some disheveled drunk that wondered on to the political stage.\u201d The party\u2019s other wing retorted with its own grievances. The Bannon types castigated party elites for failing to support Moore, denying him donations and endorsements. Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website offered an early taste of that counter-attack with the headline: \u201cRepublican Saboteurs Flip Seat To Dems.\u201d\n3\u2013 Democrats energized. After a dominant performance last month in races across the country, Democrats now have ample reason to believe they can reclaim the House of Representatives in next year\u2019s midterms. Turnout has been unexpectedly high in Democrat areas; among youth; and among African-American voters. There\u2019s been a surge in fundraising and candidate-recruitment. The party can now point to its long shot win in Alabama, as it tries recruiting star candidates for anticipated close races.\n4\u2013 Start the Senate-watch. Winning either of the two congressional chambers next year would give Democrats big power \u2014 to stall bills, launch investigations and generally thwart Trump\u2019s presidency. But the ultimate prize isn\u2019t the House; it\u2019s the Senate. So far, that\u2019s seemed positively unattainable. By a fluke of the calendar, the Senate seats up for election next year are overwhelmingly Democratic, giving them few opportunities for pickups. The odds have just narrowed. To end the GOP majority, Democrats now need just two Republican seats \u2014 they will be gunning hard in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere, but must still defending their own two-dozen seats up for re-election. Why does the Senate matter so much? It doesn\u2019t just adopt laws, like the House. It\u2019s also the chamber that approves presidential nominations \u2014 to the cabinet, federal agencies, and the Supreme Court. And that court has three judges aged over 75 years old, with their eventual replacements poised to decide hot-button issues like abortion.\n5\u2013 Spotlight on Donald Trump. His unpopularity is starting to worry his party. Fearing a tidal wave in next year\u2019s midterms, some Republicans are grumbling that the president must adjust his behaviour. Former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, on CNN, called the results a wake-up call for Trump: \u201cIt is a very clear warning shot.\u201d He urged the president to tone down the constant conflict and chaos, as it\u2019s turning off voters: \u201cIt\u2019s just debilitating. It wears people out. \u2026 (People are) worn out by the daily controversy coming from the president\u2019s Twitter feed.\u201d A big Trump fan agreed the result could up the pressure on him, for other reasons. Fox News pundit Laura Ingraham speculated Democrats will now recycle sexual-misconduct allegations against Trump, compare them to Moore\u2019s, point to voters\u2019 rejection of Moore and argue the president should be investigated. That\u2019s already begun. Several Democrats have been calling for investigations, or even for Trump\u2019s resignation.\n6\u2013 Roy Moore goes away. This is the silver lining for many Republicans. A number commented after Tuesday\u2019s results that his presence in the Senate would have been a political millstone. They said Democrats would have made Moore a national campaign issue \u2014 someone who\u2019s called for homosexuals to be jailed; who said Muslims should be barred from Congress; and who was reportedly once banned from a mall for his alleged habit of creeping on adolescent girls. They worried Democrats would turn Moore into the poster-boy for the Republican party and feared how that might play in states far less hospitable to them than Alabama.\n}}
{{Incoming House freshmen of the 113th Congress pose for a group photo on the East steps of the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2012.\nIt's no surprise that Americans are getting fed up with a Congress that seems to be more interested in brinkmanship and bickering than legislating and compromising. But while members of Congress continue their spats, the stock of other institutions, including banks and organized religion, is going up.\nAccording to a new Gallup poll released Thursday, Americans' confidence in Congress has dropped to an all-time low, worse than any institution since the poll was started in 1973: Only 10 percent of Americans gave Congress positive marks. This was its fourth straight year at the bottom of a list of 16 institutions.\nScraping the bottom of the barrel with Congress are health-maintenance organizations and organized labor, at 19 and 20 percent, respectively. Confidence in the medical system also dropped, falling 6 points to 35 percent among those polled.\nCongress wasn't always hated like it is today: In 1973, 42 percent of Americans had some level of confidence in the institution.\nAnd while institutions such as the military and small businesses are at the top of Americans' confidence scale, other institutions that have been at the center of controversy over the last several years seems to be enjoying a rise in stature. Confidence in banks rose 5 points in the past year, sitting at 26 percent. How soon Americans forget the banking crisis of just a few years ago that sent the market crashing and pushed the federal government to bailout those \"too big to fail.\"\nLast year, confidence in banks hit a record low for the institution at 21 percent, down 2 points from a year earlier. Before the economic downturn, confidence in banks was at 41 percent in 2007.\nThe poll was conducted June 1-4 among 1,529 adults. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\n}}
{{Neighbors in the prosperous Del Rey residential area of Alexandria weren\u2019t surprised earlier this year when police cars showed up at the home of Democratic Congressman James Moran and his wife of 11 years.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time the cops had shown up.\n\u201cThere was always a lot of screaming going on there,\u201d said one neighbor. \u201cThey fought like cats and dogs.\u201d\nMary Moran called the Alexandria police that June night and said her husband was attacking her. The police came, talked to both, and left.\nNo charges were filed.\nThe next day, Mary Moran filed for divorce, saying \u2013 among other things \u2013 that the five-term Congressman had abused her.\nMoran claimed the charges were \u201ctrumped up\u201d and filed a counter suit for divorce the following month.\nBut the incident is just the latest violent act by the bombastic Virginia congressman who has a history of bar brawls, physical assaults, threats, intimidation and even fistfights on the floor of the House of Representatives.\nAnd he has a history of getting away with it.\nJay Armington remembers his first and only encounter with Moran, then mayor of Alexandria, in a bar near the Potomac River in 1988.\n\u201cHe and another guy went from arguing to shouting to fists in just a few minutes. One of my buddies pulled the other guy away and I grabbed the mayor,\u201d Armington recalls.\nMoran, he said, wheeled around and slammed him against the bar.\n\u201cHis cheeks were bulging and he was snorting like a bull,\u201d Armington said. \u201cI realized I was looking into the eyes of a madman.\u201d\nArne Wilkens tended bar in Alexandria, where Moran served as mayor of the city from 1985-1990. He says the Mayor often got into fights.\n\u201cHe was a bully and a thug,\u201d Wilkens said. \u201cWe\u2019d call the cops, but they wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\nJonathan Schnapp, a former Alexandria resident, tried to file a criminal complaint with the Alexandria police after the Mayor threatened him following an argument outside a city council meeting. The cops just laughed.\n\u201cThey said they weren\u2019t going to risk their jobs by trying to arrest the Mayor,\u201d Schnapp said. Schnapp said he moved out of Alexandria because he felt both the Mayor and the police department were corrupt.\nAlexandria police refuse to discuss Moran\u2019s tenure as Mayor publicly, but several officers admitted privately that his behavior would have led to the arrest of \u201cordinary citizens.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mayor was clearly guilty of assault on more than one occasion,\u201d said one officer, who refused to be identified out of fear for his job. \u201cBut the word came down. The Mayor was off limits. Ordinary citizens go to jail. Not the Mayor.\u201d\nWinning a seat in Congress in 1990 didn\u2019t change Moran\u2019s violent ways. He got into more than one shoving match with other members of Congress, including Indiana Republican Dan Burton and California Republican Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham.\nMoran was an amateur boxer in his youth and told WashingtonianMagazine that had he not become a politician, he might have tried professional boxing because \u201cI like to hit people.\u201d\nSupporters of the temperamental Congressman say he is just a \u201ctypical Irish rogue,\u201d charming one minute, belligerent the other.\n\u201cAlexandria likes rogues,\u201d says one political supporter. \u201cThe city has a long, colorful history of flamboyant politicians.\nBut political opponents say Moran is a \u201cviolent man, a time bomb who is always ticking and ready to go off.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s always boiling,\u201d says Sam Asrets, a former Alexandria activist who opposed Moran on many issues during his term as mayor.\n\u201cHe knows he can get away with this because there\u2019s never any accountability,\u201d Asrets says. \u201cHe gets breaks that ordinary people don\u2019t get. Had he learned early on that there would be punishment for his behavior, he would have been a lot better off.\u201d\nSupporters say Moran deserves a break because his daughter, Dorothy, was diagnosed with brain and spinal cancer six years ago. The daughter, now 8, has gone into remission, but the Morans spent more than $15,000 on alternative care on top of $200,000 in insured treatment.\nHowever, Moran, who was also a stockbroker before becoming mayor of Alexandria, is nearly a million dollars in debt from failed investments and out-of-control spending patterns that go far beyond what the couple spent on their daughter.\nThe financial problems have become a central part of the increasingly nasty divorce proceedings between Moran and his wife. Mary Moran, 44, went heavily into debt buying gifts and antiques the year her daughter was diagnosed with cancer.\nMoran also lost $120,000 in high-risk stock options and futures contracts in 1995 and 1996, according to his financial disclosure forms on file in Congress. Two years later, he reported increasingly heavy debts\nAlexandria public records show Moran more than doubled the mortgage on his home, from $202,000 to $447,000, and is frequently late with payments. Moran earns $136,700 a year as a Congressman, but has more than $7,000 a month in housing and loan payments.\nIronically, the Congressman sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, which controls the finances of the nation. He serves on subcommittees overseeing defense and interior expenditures.\nBut the Congressman shows little ability to control his own finances and increasingly taps his campaign funds to pay personal bills.\nIn her divorce petition, attorneys for Mary Moran say the congressman has a history of \u201cwasting the family assets on his stock market gambling.\u201d Mrs. Moran seeks $25,000 in support and possession of their home. She says her husband \u201chas wasted marital funds on the excessive purchases for unnecessary items.\u201d\nMoran played the stock market and lost. He wiped out earlier stock holdings and used income tax refunds as seed money, losing $34,000 in more than 80 trades in 1995. In 1996, he lost another $93,000 in more than 100 failed trades.\nEven though the stock market was booming, Moran risked his money on high-risk, potentially lucrative futures and options trading, seeking higher profits by trading on the direction of general market index funds, as well as on an array of U.S. and foreign technology and industrial stocks. He lost it all.\nAs his losses mounted, Moran borrowed heavily against both his Alexandria home and a vacation home in King George County, VA. The two mortgages amount to more than $600,000.\nBoth loans came at above-market rates from MBNA Consumer Services Inc., a finance operation that makes high interest loans to high-risk customers.\nMoran has tried, and failed, to sell both of his houses over the past 18 months. Public appraisals put the value of both homes below the amount that the Congressman owes on his loans.\nCongressional disclosure forms also show the Morans tripled their credit card debt from 1993 to 1997 and now owe more than $45,000 on the cards. Moran also has borrowed the maximum against his congressional retirement fund \u2014 $20,000.\nMoran sold his car in 1996 and turned to his campaign fund to lease a car for his personal use, according to his campaign financial statements. While other members of Congress use campaign funds for a car in their districts far from Washington, Moran\u2019s actions have raised eyebrows in Congress.\nHe also tripled his reimbursement requests from the campaign in 1997\u2013an off year for elections\u2013for meals and gifts, increasing the amount the campaign pays from $4,000 in 1995 to more than $12,000 in 1997.

{{PRINCETON, NJ -- Americans remain highly critical of the job Congress is doing, but the 19% who approve is up significantly from 14% last month, and the highest in any month since October 2012. Congress' approval rating has exceeded the current 19% on only a few occasions over the last three years, a span that includes the all-time low ratings of 10% in February 2012 and August 2012.\nThe latest evaluation of Congress comes as the institution is considering President Barack Obama's request that it authorize U.S. military action against Syria in response to reports that the country's leaders used chemical weapons on its citizens. The Sept. 5-8 poll was conducted before Obama's nationwide address about the situation in Syria on Sept. 10, and before he asked Congress to delay a vote to give new Russian diplomatic proposals a chance to work.\nIn contrast to Congress' ratings, President Obama's overall job approval ratings and ratings on specific issues have not improved in recent weeks. However, his job approval rating, currently at 45% in Gallup Daily tracking, remains much higher than that of Congress. His approval rating for handling the situation in Syria, specifically -- again from the pre-speech Sept. 5-8 poll -- is 31%.\nCongress Approval Ratings Better Among All Party Groups\nRatings of Congress are improved among all party groups compared with August. Republicans' approval has increased five percentage points to 18%, independents' ratings have gone up six points to 19%, while Democrats' approval has increased three points to 20%.\nSince the middle of last year, Republicans have generally given Congress lower approval ratings than have Democrats or independents. But now Republicans' ratings of Congress are about the same as those of the other party groups.\nImplications\nCongress' approval rating remains low, and well below the historical average of 33% since Gallup began asking the question in 1974. However, given that Congress' ratings have been almost exclusively below 20% the last three years, its current 19% approval rating seems positive by comparison.\nThe timing of the recent poll -- closely following the president's request for authorization to use force in Syria -- combined with Americans' opposition to such action suggests that Congress' apparent lack of enthusiasm about this military intervention may be the reason for the increase in its approval rating. Before Obama asked for a delay in the congressional vote, it was unclear whether Congress would authorize military action against Syria, with many more members publicly opposing it than publicly favoring it, and a large number undecided.\n}}
{{As a new Congress takes office Thursday amid a partial government shutdown, most Americans see quite a few key issues as important for Congress and the White House to tackle this year.\nWhile education, healthcare and the economy once again rank as their top three priorities, majorities of U.S. adults also desire to see leaders tackle a host of pressing issues such as immigration, gun policy, the nation's infrastructure and the distribution of income and wealth across the nation.\nWhile most of the priorities remained stable, those saying education is extremely important was up (42%) compared with the last time the question was asked in 2014 (26%). However, one noticeable shift took place at the very bottom of the priority list -- the issue of income and wealth distribution.\nAs low unemployment has been coupled with slow wage growth, income inequality has gained importance among Americans. Sixty-two percent of Americans say it is either very or extremely important that the president and Congress deal with the issue of distribution of income and wealth within the country, up from Gallup's last measure of 57% in 2014.\nAlthough it ranked lower than traditional issues, such as dealing with the federal budget deficit and immigration, the majority of Americans who see income distribution as important for leaders to deal with reflects how it has become a major issue of focus not only in the United States, but also other developed economies.\nOn a related note, Gallup recently found that rising numbers of Americans view socialism positively and associate it with some form of greater equality. Americans' increasing embrace of socialism, coupled with the fact that a majority view the issue of income distribution as important for national leaders, could mean a greater focus on such issues as the presidential campaign season begins its long march to 2020.\nDrug Abuse\nThree out of every four Americans view drug abuse as either an extremely or very important issue for the new Congress and the president to address this year.\nWhile this was the first time Gallup offered drug abuse as an answer choice, it's no surprise that 75% would cite this issue as important, with more than 100 daily deaths across the country related to opioid overdoses alone, as well as a rise in national overdose deaths in general. Recent research has shown it has also contributed to Americans' lower life expectancy.\nJust a few months earlier, three in 10 Americans told Gallup that drug abuse had caused trouble in their family, a perception that has seen a steady increase since the mid-1990s. Slightly more Americans (37%) cite alcohol abuse as a cause of trouble in their family than cite drug abuse.\nBottom Line\nDespite the partisan contentions that many expect to define the working relationship between the incoming Congress and the Donald Trump White House amid a partial government shutdown, Americans are clear on what they want to see their leaders tackle in 2019.\nWith education, healthcare and the economy topping priorities as they have for the past several years, more specific concerns about drug abuse and the distribution of income and wealth also garnered widespread importance in the minds of most Americans.\nA majority of Americans also express a strong appetite for leadership to take action on issues such as the federal budget deficit and immigration.\nThere is a lot of common ground on the issues Americans want to see their leaders prioritize; a failure to effectively tackle those issues will likely continue to be reflected in low approval ratings for Congress.\n}}
{{Elouise Cobell first sensed something was wrong with the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a student, when she got a summer job at a BIA office in Montana. \"[People] would wait for hours. I didn't understand what was going on,\" she says.\nYears later, as treasurer for her Blackfeet tribe, her suspicions were confirmed. The BIA oversees trust accounts worth billions for individuals and tribes, accounts that government reviews now show to have been grossly mismanaged for decades.\nToday Ms. Cobell is one of five native American leaders behind a class action suit filed against the BIA by the Boulder, Colo.-based Native American Rights Fund. The $540 million suit, filed on behalf of 300,000 Indians, may mark the start of a shift away from reliance on the federal agency for financial management.\nGovernment malfeasance and a developing financial strength and savvy (in some cases, gleaned from running casino operations) have already prompted some tribes to take their accounts out of federal hands. The Oneidas of Wisconsin have managed their own accounts since the 1980s and tribal attorney Aurene Martin says other tribes will follow. \"Tribes are thinking they could do a better job,\" she says. \"They wouldn't do any worse.\"\nA recent independent review of 2,000 tribal accounts estimated $695 million was mishandled in the past 20 years. Auditors couldn't locate records for $2.4 billion in transactions and say individual accounts, which range from 35 cents to $1 million, are in even worse shape. \"If your bank...couldn't tell you how much you had, you'd be pretty upset,\" Cobell says.\nNext week Congress will hold the last of several hearings to see if the tribes are willing to accept the findings of their investigation and what legislation needs to be introduced to compensate them. \"If we made a mistake, we'll pay,\" says Ed Cohen, deputy solicitor for the Department of the Interior. \"But I think it would be far more productive if we were handling these issues legislatively, rather than litigating them.\"\nThe BIA's role dates back to the 19th century, when Indians weren't considered competent to manage their own affairs. But Cobell says it's the BIA, which was managing 2,000 accounts worth billions by 1994, that has proved its incompetence.\nMany tribes earn money from leases on tribal lands held in trust. Royalties from oil and gas exploration leases are collected by federal agencies and transferred to the BIA, which pools and invests the funds. Tribes and individuals are supposed to receive monthly checks, but Cobell discovered her tribe was losing, not earning money. \"When I tried to look into it, I found it very difficult to obtain account statements,\" she recalls.\nThe results of a BIA audit led Congress to appoint former bank director Paul Homan as special trustee for American Indians in 1994. Among the problems he found:\n*The BIA had never set up an accounts receivable system, making it impossible to track how much money was in the system at any given time.\n*Over $50 million had not been paid to individual account holders because the BIA had lost track of them.\n*21,000 accounts bore the names of people who were dead.\n*Records were water damaged and unreadable.\n\"Honestly, I have never seen anything like it in my 30-year career,\" Mr. Homan told a Senate panel in June. Homan has presented Congress with a plan to fix the BIA's banking systems, but solutions will depend in part on Congress's willingness to fund the agency. \"It's hard to convince them they're not throwing good money after bad,\" says a House staffer who works on native American issues. There have been proposals to privatize the BIA. But tribal leaders say they want the system fixed before it's privatized. \"That would be a natural way out for the government,\" says Cobell. \"They transfer it, say to Wells Fargo - then who's responsible for historical wrongs?\"\n}}
{{WASHINGTON\u2013A new report by the U.S.\u2013China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) calls for a complete ban on allowing China\u2019s state-owned or state-controlled companies to buy U.S. assets. The policy recommendation reflects the growing concern among China experts that China\u2019s incursions into the U.S. economy, especially in areas sensitive for national security, might eventually help the Chinese regime to attack the United States.\nThe annual report by the USCC on developments in U.S.\u2013China economic and security issues includes recommendations for U.S. policymakers, including \u201cprohibiting the acquisition of U.S. assets by Chinese state-owned or state-controlled entities, including sovereign wealth funds.\u201d\nChinese foreign direct investment in the United States has been booming for years, reaching a record high of $45.6 billion in 2016\u2014triple the total from the year before, according to a report by the economic research firm Rhodium Group. Many of these investments are made by China\u2019s state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which are controlled by the Chinese regime.\nThe USCC report states: \u201cChinese [foreign direct investment] is targeting industries deemed strategic by the Chinese government, including information and communications technology, agriculture, and biotechnology. These investments lead to the transfer of valuable U.S. assets, intellectual property, and technology to China, presenting potential risks to critical U.S. economic and national security interests.\u201d\nChinese SOEs can evade legal action in the United States by invoking their status as a foreign government entity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\nWhat makes the matter worse, according to the USCC, is the fact that Chinese SOEs can evade legal action in the United States by invoking their status as a foreign government entity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n\u201cThe opaque nature of China\u2019s financial system makes it impossible to verify the accuracy of Chinese companies\u2019 financial disclosures and auditing reports. Chinese businesses continue to list on U.S. stock exchanges to raise capital, despite operating outside the laws and regulations governing U.S. firms,\u201d the report states.\nAt the report\u2019s release, Michael Wessel, a USCC commissioner, said that although the report only recommends the banning of Chinese SOEs, private Chinese companies would still be subjected to security reviews to examine their acquisition of U.S. assets in the context of national security.\n\u2018Long Overdue\u2019 Scrutiny\nAccording to Gordon Chang, an analyst who specializes in East Asia economic and security issues, Chinese acquisition of American assets is a serious issue to which policy responses have been \u201clong overdue.\u201d\n\u201cChina has been buying technologies that have military applications, and no one [in the United States] wants to see that,\u201d said Chang.\nWhile the USCC\u2019s report in 2016 also made the same recommendation to completely ban Chinese SOEs from acquiring U.S. assets, Chang points out that there is now a higher chance for it to be enacted. With the Trump administration in power, new people are steering U.S. policy on China.\nCongress has also launched its own initiative to tackle Chinese investments. On Nov. 8, the Senate\u2019s No. 2-ranking Republican, John Cornyn, introduced a bill known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which he said will prevent foreign investments in the United States that pose a risk to national security.\nWhile the bill does not specifically name China, it was clearly in the crosshairs when Cornyn delivered a speech on Nov. 14 in which he said \u201cit\u2019s time for the U.S. to adopt a new policy on China\u201d as it is \u201cvacuuming up U.S. technologies whenever it can.\u201d\n}}
{{Justice Stephen Breyer\n(CNSNews.com) - During oral arguments in the Supreme Court this week, Justice Stephen Breyer posed and answered the core question at issue in the controversy over the constitutionality of Obamacare\u2019s mandate that individual Americans must buy government-approved health insurance policies: Can Congress order individuals to buy a good or service?\n\u201cYes, of course they could,\u201d said Breyer.\nIn the history of the nation, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government has never done this.\nBut Breyer, on Tuesday, stated his belief that the basic power of Congress to do such a thing was settled by the Supreme Court as early as 1819, in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, in which the court decided Congress had the power to create a Bank of the United States.\nBreyer explained his point of view after becoming impatient with the convoluted answers Solicitor General Donald Verrilli had offered up in response to questions from Justices Sam Alito and Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts.\nAlito had asked Verrilli if Congress could force young people to buy burial insurance because everyone is going to die someday. Roberts asked Verrilli if Congress could force people to buy cell phones because it would facilitate contacting emergency services in the event of an accident. And Kennedy asked Verrilli: \u201cCan you create commerce in order to regulate it.\u201d\n\u201cI'm somewhat uncertain about your answers to, for example, Justice Kennedy,\u201d said Breyer. He \u201casked, can you, under the Commerce Clause, Congress create commerce where previously none existed.\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Breyer, \u201cI thought the answer to that was, since McCulloch versus Maryland, when the Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United States which did not previously exist, which job was to create commerce that did not previously exist, since that time the answer has been, yes.\n\u201cI would have thought that your answer [to] can the government, in fact, require you to buy cell phones or buy burials that, if we propose comparable situations, if we have, for example, a uniform United States system of paying for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid Burial, Ship Burial, ERISA Burial and Emergency Burial beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be: Yes, of course, they could,\u201d said Breyer.\n\u201cAnd the same with the computers, or the same with the cell phones, if you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a federal emergency service, just as you say you have to buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the environment, you could,\u201d said Breyer.\n\u201cI mean, see, doesn't it depend on the situation?\u201d said Breyer.\n\u201cIt does, Justice Breyer,\u201d said Verrilli, \u201cand if Congress were to enact laws like that, we \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWould be up here defending it,\u201d said Breyer.\n\u201cIt would be my responsibility to then defend them, and I would defend them on a rationale like that, but I do think that we are advancing a narrower rationale,\u201d said Verrilli.\nBreyer served as a counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the late 1970s, when Sen. Ted Kennedy (D.-Mass.) chaired that committee. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In 1994, President Clinton nominated him to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, who in 1973 had authored the Roe v. Wade decision that declared abortion a constitutional right.\nWhen Breyer was confirmed to the Supreme Court, only 9 Republicans in the Senate voted against him.\n}}

{{House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) (AP Photo)\nU.S. Constitution\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said that the individual health insurance mandates included in every health reform bill, which require Americans to have insurance, were \u201clike paying taxes.\u201d He added that Congress has \u201cbroad authority\u201d to force Americans to purchase other things as well, so long as it was trying to promote \u201cthe general welfare.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office, however, has stated in the past that a mandate forcing Americans to buy health insurance would be an \u201c unprecedented form of federal action ,\u201d and that the \u201cgovernment has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.\u201dHoyer, speaking to reporters at his weekly press briefing on Tuesday, was asked by CNSNews.com where in the Constitution was Congress granted the power to mandate that a person must by a health insurance policy. Hoyer said that, in providing for the general welfare, Congress had \u201cbroad authority.\u201d\u201cWell, in promoting the general welfare the Constitution obviously gives broad authority to Congress to effect that end,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThe end that we\u2019re trying to effect is to make health care affordable, so I think clearly this is within our constitutional responsibility.\u201dHoyer compared a health insurance mandate to the government\u2019s power to levy taxes, saying \u201cwe mandate other things as well, like paying taxes.\u201dThe section of the Constitution Hoyer was referring to, Article I, Section 8, outlines the powers of Congress, including raising taxes, but not the purchasing any type of product or service. The opening paragraph of Section 8 grants Congress the power to raise taxes to, among other things, \u201cprovide for the \u2026 general welfare of the United States.\u201dSection 8 partly reads: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\u201dThe Constitution then details the specific powers of Congress, including raising an Army and Navy, regulating commerce between states, and to \u201cmake all laws necessary and proper\u201d for the carrying out of these enumerated powers.\u201cTo make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof,\u201d concludes Section 8.CNSNews.com also asked Hoyer if there is a limit to what Congress can mandate that Americans purchase and whether there is anything that specifically could not be mandated to purchase. Hoyer said that eventually the Supreme Court would find a limit to Congress\u2019 power, adding that mandates that unfairly favored one person or company over another would obviously be unconstitutional.\u201cI\u2019m sure the [Supreme] Court will find a limit,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cFor instance, if we mandated that you buy General Motors\u2019 automobiles, I believe that would be far beyond our constitutional responsibility and indeed would violate the Due Process Clause as well \u2013 in terms of equal treatment to automobile manufacturers.\u201dHoyer said that the insurance mandate was constitutional because Congress is not forcing Americans to buy one particular policy, just any health insurance policy.\u201cWe don\u2019t mandate that they buy a particular insurance [policy] but what we do mandate is that like driving a car -- if you\u2019re going to drive a car, to protect people on the roadway, and yourself, and the public for having to pay your expenses if you get hurt badly \u2013 that you need to have insurance,\u201d said Hoyer.In 1994, the Congressional Budget Office reported the following about health insurance mandates: \u201cA mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States. An individual mandate would have two features that, in combination, would make it unique. First, it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society. Second, it would require people to purchase a specific service that would be heavily regulated by the federal government.\u201dUnder all five of the health care bills currently being considered in Congress, every American adult would have to have a policy that conformed to government standards for coverage and premiums. Each bill creates Bronze, Silver, and Gold health insurance plans and mandates that Americans buy one of them, either through their employer or through government-run exchanges.David B. Rivkin, a constitutional lawyer with Baker & Hostetler, told CNSNews.com that Hoyer\u2019s argument was \u201csilly,\u201d adding that if the general welfare clause was that elastic, then nothing would be outside of Congress\u2019 powers.\u201cCongressman Hoyer is wrong,\u201d Rivkin said. \u201cThe notion that the general welfare language is a basis for a specific legislative exercise is all silly because if that\u2019s true, because general welfare language is inherently limitless, then the federal government can do anything.\u201cThe arguments are, I believe, feeble,\u201d he said.\n}}

{{The US is keeping hundreds of American troops and security personnel in Iraq, despite a recently-passed resolution from Congress that failed to reauthorize funding for the US military to train and support Iraqi security forces.\nMost Americans have been led to believe that all US forces besides those guarding the massive American Embassy in Iraq have been withdrawn since the end of last year. But small units of up to 300 troops have remained in Baghdad to train Iraqi security forces and provide aid and support, allegedly for counter-terrorism operations.\nIn reality, US troops have been providing this support to elite Iraqi forces that report directly to the increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. They have essentially been used as a secret police force for Maliki to attack, detain, and torture his political opponents and crack down harshly on public dissent.\nThere were attempts in the Washington pipe-line to negotiate with Iraq an agreement in which even more US troops would be sent back. But last month, Congress passed a resolution that did not reauthorize funding for these small units. \u201cThe authority for U.S. forces to train and assist the Iraqi security forces expired Sunday [Sept. 30],\u201d reports The Cable\u2018s Josh Rogin.\nStill, the Pentagon is scrambling to try and keep the forces there.\n\u201cNo personnel will return immediately to the United States on Oct. 1, 2012 while DoD is reviewing the effect of not being authorized under the Continuing Resolution to continue the training of Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) following expiration of the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF) authority on Sept. 30, 2012,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Lt.

Obama has made bolstering national service programs a high priority, and in his overall budget proposal has called for more than $1.1 billion for the programs, an increase of more than $210 million.\nWith the nation plunging deeper into a recession, Obama and backers of the effort see it as a way to channel a rising desire among Americans to help their neighbors.\n\"History has ... shown that in time of crisis, Americans turn to service and volunteering for healing, for rebuilding and for hope. The spirit of generosity in the American people is one of the greatest assets of our nation,\" Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said during debate on the bill.\nEconomic downturn, volunteer surge\nApplications to AmeriCorps have exploded with the plunging employment market. Last month, there were 9,731 applications submitted to the AmeriCorps online system, more than triple the 3,159 submitted in February 2008. In the AmeriCorps program, 75,000 people spend 10 months to a year helping build affordable homes or responding to disasters. Most receive an annual stipend of slightly less than $12,000.\nLast year, more than 500 AmeriCorps members helped coordinate more than 200,000 Habitat for Humanity volunteers to build 1,700 new homes. Some AmeriCorps participants also helped families get ready for homeownership.\nThe bill provides for gradually increasing the size of AmeriCorps to 250,000 enrollees over eight years.\n\"People are feeling their own pain, but they're also feeling their neighbors' pain,\" said Alan Solomont, board chairman of the government-run Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees AmeriCorps and will be in charge of overseeing new programs for middle and high school students and people 55 and over.\nSpecialists sought\nThe legislation outlines five broad categories where people can direct their service: helping the poor, improving education, encouraging energy efficiency, strengthening access to health care and assisting veterans. People working in these new corps would provide such services as weatherizing homes or teaching computer skills to seniors or the unemployed.\nMark Andrews, senior director for U.S. operations for Habitat for Humanity International, said the bill was \"absolutely necessary\" because it will provide the organization with more participants who have specialized skills in construction or family services. These AmeriCorps members are then able to train more volunteers.\n\"National service gives us the opportunity to bring in some of the best and the brightest, in terms of young people right out of school, as well as folks who have completed their career and want to give back to their communities in a more significant way,\" Andrews said.\nExperience counts\nPeople 55 and older could also earn $1,000 education awards by getting involved in public service. Those awards can be transferred to a child, grandchild or even someone they mentored.\nTom Nelson, AARP's chief operating officer, said the bill gives more older Americans the chance to apply their years of experience to helping others.\nNelson said his group is hearing from thousands of people who say, \"How do I get involved, how do I help my community?\"\n\"That older volunteer can be the ideal volunteer,\" he said.\nThe bill also ties volunteer work to money for college in other ways.\nSixth graders through high school seniors could earn a $500 education award for helping in their neighborhoods during a new summer program.\nEducation awards for AmeriCorps participants would increase from $4,725 to $5,350. That money can be used to help pay for college or help pay off student loans. Future increases would be tied to increases in the maximum size of Pell grants.\nThe bill is named for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has been its champion. Kennedy is being treated for brain cancer but returned to Washington last week to vote for the legislation.\n}}
{{A few years ago, I went with a friend and her family to a Jewish restaurant in New York City known for comfort food and vodka. Early in the evening, its entertainer asked everyone where they were from, and my friend\u2019s dad announced I was Palestinian. He meant well: it was an enthusiastic \u201cIsn\u2019t it great we\u2019re all getting along?\u201d statement. The entertainer wasn\u2019t quite so enthusiastic, and proclaimed to the room: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a Palestinian.\u201d I left in tears. It kinda ruined dinner.\nWhile the restaurant incident was particularly unpleasant, it wasn\u2019t the first or last time I have been told Palestinians don\u2019t exist. It happens all the time. I am proud of being Palestinian, but it gets exhausting having to constantly prove your humanity and plead your legitimacy. It gets exhausting reiterating you don\u2019t hate anyone, you just want to be treated with dignity. So, in the end, just to make things easier, you start erasing your identity yourself. I often vaguely say I\u2019m half-Arab, half-English when people ask where I am from. Over time, you stop taking joy in your heritage and tiptoe warily around it instead.\nWhich is why 3 January, when Rashida Tlaib became the first Palestinian American woman to be sworn into Congress, was such a momentous day for me and so many other Palestinians. Tlaib did not tiptoe around her heritage; instead she wore a traditional Palestinian thobe (gown) for the occasion, prompting hundreds of other Palestinians to share proud pictures of their own national dresses, with the hashtag #TweetYourThobe. In an article for Elle explaining why she wore her thobe, Tlaib stressed: \u201cWe should embrace who we are and not be shamed for it.\u201d It was a shame there was a need for her to say that; a shame I needed to hear it.\n\u2022 This article originally described Rashida Tlaib as the first Palestinian American in Congress, rather than the first Palestinian American woman in Congress. This has been corrected.\n}}
{{Half of all Americans want President Obama to launch a missile strike on Syria, but nearly 80 percent want him to get congressional approval first, according to an NBC News poll.\nThe poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, reveals a nuanced, or perhaps contradictory, attitude about the use of force.

But support for action jumped to 50 percent \u2014 and opposition dropped to 44 \u2014 when respondents were asked specifically about \"military action \"\u00a6 limited to air strikes using cruise missiles launched from U.S. naval ships.\"\nFinally, 58 percent of respondents agreed that the use of chemical weapons by any country is a \"red line\" that requires \"a significant U.S. response, including the possibility of military action,\" while only 35 percent disagreed.\nRespondents were much more unified when asked about whether Obama should require congressional approval before getting the military involved in Syria, with 79 percent agreeing and only 16 percent opposed.\nThe poll's authors put its margin of error at 3.7 percentage points.\nScholars support a broad range of positions on how much authority the president has to attack another country without legislative approval. But regardless of the legal text, the on-the-ground reality is that Congress has been largely unsuccessful in stopping presidents from launching strikes without approval, said James Lindsey, director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nObama did not secure congressional approval for the country's most recent military intervention in the Arab world, a series of strikes in Libya aimed at toppling the regime of Muammar el-Qaddafi.\n{{ BIZOBJ (video: 4411) }}\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nHaaland, 58, had just conducted a brief staff meeting and was sitting in her new office on Capitol Hill as staffers got phones working and solved logistical problems like wrestling a printer through a narrow doorway.\nThe first-time elected official represents New Mexico\u2019s 1st Congressional District and is a member of the state\u2019s Laguna Pueblo tribe. \u201cCongress has never heard a voice like mine,\u201d the Democrat said.\n\u201cAs the first Native American woman in Congress, I know that there will be an expectation on me by tribes across the country to be somebody that can move their issues forward,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely something I feel optimistic that I will be able to do.\u201d\nShe said there is an \u201cepidemic\u201d of missing and murdered indigenous women, and Haaland would like Congress to hold additional oversight hearings on the issue and make sure tribal justice systems have the resources they need to conduct proper investigations.\nAlso at the top of her list is combating climate change, which threatens fragile tribal lands. \u201cIf you\u2019re not scared to death right now about climate change, you\u2019re not reading the news,\u201d she said.\nHaaland is one of a record-breaking 102 women who will serve in the 435-seat House during the 2019-2020 session.\nThere are many firsts among them. Haaland and Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, are the first Native American women. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim women. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut are the first black women to represent their states. All are Democrats.\nWhen Haaland was born in 1960, Native Americans did not have the right to vote in New Mexico - despite being granted full U.S. citizenship by the federal government in 1924. They got it in 1962, making the Southwestern state the last in the nation to extend it.\nOn Thursday, Haaland welcomed her new constituents to an open house at her congressional office before being sworn in on the House floor. She wore traditional tribal garments to the ceremony, including a pomegranate blossom necklace of silver and turquoise, signifying protection and strength, made by a Laguna artist.\nAfter raising her hand to take the oath of office with her peers, the consequence of the milestone sunk in.\nOvercome with emotion, Haaland turned to embrace Davids, borrowing the edge of her new colleague\u2019s scarf to dab away her tears.\nFor photo essay, please click on: reut.rs/2FdvcIx\n}}
{{WASHINGTON -- It has been political warfare with no winners. All those involved -- Republicans, Democrats, Congress, the president, the press and the voters -- have been losers.\nBoth sides walk away from the impeachment of Bill Clinton with bitterness and anger as they face the possibility and perhaps the prospect of several ugly months ahead while the Senate deals with his case.\nNor is it the usual sham anger that politicians employ for public consumption, then quickly put aside once an issue is settled. As one principal in this episode put it the other day: \"This is real. There is real bad feeling here.\"\nThis has not been the case in other political controversies that have reached a similar level of white-hot intensity in the past two generations. The guiding principle for most successful U.S. politicians is that there is a difference between enemies and adversaries and that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.\nNational consensus\nWhen the House Judiciary Committee cast its vote for impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon 24 years ago, there was a national consensus that his transgressions merited the action. That was evident not only in the bipartisan vote but in the fact that a delegation of leading Republicans -- Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott and House Minority Leader John Rhodes -- went down Pennsylvania Avenue to tell Nixon it was time to resign.\nAt the most superficial level, the Democrats were the \"winners\" in Watergate. The disgrace of the Republican president contributed to a significant Democratic gain in the midterm elections that same November and set the stage for the election of a Democrat from outside of Washington, Jimmy Carter, two years later.\nBut thoughtful leaders in both parties agreed the real winners were Americans in general. The committee produced enough evidence against Nixon to reassure most, if not all, doubters. The system had worked and had emerged essentially unscathed despite all the hand-wringing over \"the trauma of Watergate.\"\nThe political system also worked in dealing with two other issues that caused searing divisions in the country -- civil rights and the war in Vietnam.\nProtest and violence\nIn the first case, it took years of protest and violence, but the country finally reached a broad consensus that federal legislation was needed to redress the wrongs of the past. Again, there were many winners when the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nThe same could be said of the way the system worked, finally, in bringing an end to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War after years of bitterness and turmoil. Not everyone agreed with the change in policy. But it was a bipartisan product, and there was a national consensus behind it.\nIn this case, by contrast, we have had what House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt called \"the politics of smear and slash and burn\" leaving deep and lasting stains on all parties involved.\nIn their pursuit of Clinton, the Republicans have demonstrated a partisan zeal that has caused a steady and sharp decline in their approval ratings in opinion polls. A new CBS News survey found Americans saying 61 percent to 28 percent that Republicans are \"out of touch\" with the popular will.\nBut if the Republicans are losers because of their image as mindless partisans, it is hard to argue that the Democrats are winners because they may be able to use the issue in the next House elections. Instead, thoughtful Democrats admit at least privately that they suffer by being forced to defend a president who has put himself in an essentially indefensible position.\nThe awkward position of the Democrats was obvious all through the two days of House debate as one after another of these \"defenders\" of the president excoriated him for conduct that was, as one member put it, \"deplorable, reprehensible and immoral.\"\nClinton's defenders were reduced to their argument that because a sexual affair was at the root of the problem, it was too trivial. As Vice President Al Gore put it, \"You don't impeach the president over something like this.\"\nThe president has emerged as a loser on several levels. He has the dubious distinction of being the first chief executive impeached in 130 years. And he has been shown to be essentially naked to his enemies.\nHis fellow Democrats may prop him up by sticking with him during a Senate trial. But they have not forgiven him for lying to them about the Monica Lewinsky affair in the first place. And many Democrats are privately outraged by the legalistic and sometimes patronizing way that Clinton has dealt with the investigators.\nThe result is a poisonous political climate that makes it plain how difficult, if not impossible, it may be for the president to pursue any agenda of sensitive issues in the final two years of his term.\nMedia tarnished\nThe news media have also emerged from this process with a badly tarnished image. That was ensured when Robert L. Livingston decided to resign from Congress rather than serve as speaker of the House after being forced by the media to confess publicly to extramarital affairs.\nLivingston was being pursued by a pornographic magazine, Hustler, rather than by the so-called \"mainstream\" media -- meaning leading newspapers and the television networks. But what Livingston understood was that these days, anything published anywhere quickly finds its way into the mainstream on one pretext or another.\nIn his final appeal against impeaching the president, Gephardt urged the House not to capitulate to what he called \"the negative forces consuming our political system and our country.\" But if the polls are correct, most Americans think that has already happened.\nPub Date: 12/20/98\n}}
{{House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has said that Republicans won't even vote on the American Jobs Act.

The act includes measures that both Democrats and Republicans have long supported, and House Republicans are refusing to consider it.\nIf representatives would rather reverse, deny, or ignore motions from the president \u2014 even if it costs more American jobs \u2014 than work together with a Democratic president who is trying to work with them ... well, it just goes to show that the Republicans elected to office are refusing to do the job that they were elected to do.\nI would gladly watch Republicans vote no on an act that is fully paid for under President Obama's deficit-reduction plan, an act that includes new tax cuts to help America's small businesses, includes tax credits to support businesses that hire veterans and invests $35 billion to prevent the layoffs of up to 280,000 teachers and keep cops and firefighters on the job.\nI would gladly watch Republicans vote no, if only to see the public outcry against the Republican Party and watch as more Democrats are voted into office because of Republican incompetence. This at supports small businesses, and it put $1,500 into the pockets of individual American workers. I can't comprehend anyone voting no at all, unless it was as a result of some anti-American agenda. But if Republican representatives want to be voted out of office, that is totally up to them. I'll gladly watch them go.\nSamantha O'Dell\nNewport Beach\n*\nWe need bipartisanship on jobs\nI am asking Congress to vote for and pass the American Jobs Act.

Ixil Mayan genocide survivors gather outside the Guatemalan Supreme Court demanding justice for their loved ones.\nGuatemalan congressional members are actively pursuing a reform to the country\u2019s National Reconciliation law that will provide amnesty to military officials convicted or accused of committing war crimes. If passed, the reform would require the release, within twenty-four hours, of more than thirty military officials convicted of committing atrocities during the war.\nThe reform was first proposed by Congressman Fernando Linares Beltranena of the conservative National Advancement Party, and other congressional members in 2017. The measure, which the Guatemalan congress took up in February, changes the National Reconciliation law that was passed ahead of the signing of the 1996 peace accords. Guatemala\u2019s civil war raged from 1960 to 1996.\nThe law granted amnesty for guerrillas for crimes against state forces, as well as for other crimes except torture, sexual violence, genocide, and forced disappearance. The new reforms would give a blanket amnesty to those already prosecuted and convicted, or those now under investigation.\nOpposing the changes are the families of war victims.\n\u201cWe are against the reforms to the National Reconciliation law and the implementation of amnesty,\u201d Rosalina Tuyuc, the coordinator for the organization National Coordination of Widows of Guatemala, told me. \u201cIt would leave those material and intellectual actors responsible for violations of human rights.\u201d\nMore than 200,000 people were killed during Guatemala's thirty-six-year-long internal armed conflict, with another 45,000 forcibly disappeared.\nTuyuc adds, \u201cReforming the National Reconciliation law would be a step back for the culture of peace, a step back for the access to justice for the indigenous peoples, and more so a step back for the victims that were affected by the armed conflict. It would be a negative message: that in Guatemala you cannot prosecute for crimes against humanity, that it remains in impunity.\u201d\nSandra Moran, a congresswoman with Guatemala\u2019s leftwing political party, Bancada Covergenicia, agrees the proposed reform would be a setback for the already fragile Guatemalan democracy.\n\u201c[The reform] would impede the continuation of the cases [against military officials],\u201d Moran said. \u201cJustice in Guatemala would lose.\u201d\nThe United States Department of State is also wary of the proposed reforms.\n\u201cThe United States is deeply concerned about the proposed amendment to the national reconciliation law in Guatemala,\u201d Robert Palladino, the State Department deputy spokesman, said in a press statement.\n\u201cThe trials held in Guatemala for crimes related to human rights violations and abuses have restored dignity to the victims\u2019 surviving families, inspired increased trust in state institutions, and served as a positive example to other nations seeking to address a legacy of conflict,\u201d Palladino said.\nYet the administration of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales has rejected this criticism, saying \u201cWe Guatemalans should resolve our problems.\u201d\nIndigenous groups and associations of victims have filed injunctions against the reform in Guatemala\u2019s Constitutional Court. One is on behalf of thirty-six Achi Mayan women who suffered violent rapes during the internal armed conflict by members of the Guatemalan government-backed civilian defense groups at a military base in the 1980s.\nThe women are currently part of an ongoing court case against six men that is scheduled for a hearing in late April. Their story is one of many that attest to the crimes against humanity that occurred in Guatemala at the hands of military officials.\nMore than 200,000 people were killed during Guatemala's thirty-six-year-long internal armed conflict, with another 45,000 forcibly disappeared. The United Nations-backed Commission for Historical Clarification determined that the Guatemalan military, with support from the United States, was responsible for 93 percent of the atrocities, and the guerrillas were responsible for 3 percent. Responsibility for the remaining 4 percent was not determined.\nThe commission also determined that 83 percent of the victims were indigenous Maya, while 17 percent were non-indigenous ladinos. As a result, the commission concluded that acts of genocide occurred during the war.\nWhile the Guatemalan state has faced criticism in the twenty-one years since the signing of the peace accords for its failure to implement the agreements made between leftist guerrillas and the government that ended the war, it has made efforts to strengthen an independent judicial system.\n\u00d7 Expand Jeff Abbott An Ixil Mayann man holds a photo of his father, who was killed in the 1980's by the Guatemalan military. An Ixil Mayann man holds a photo of his father, who was killed in the 1980's by the Guatemalan military.\n\u201cOne of the important areas after the signing of the peace accords was the achievement of justice,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThe cases that have arrived to the courts have contributed to knowing the truth [of what occurred].\u201d\nA number of high-profile cases against former military officials for crimes against humanity have occurred in the years since the end of the war that have exposed the brutality of what occurred in the course of the war.\nThe most famous of the trials occurred in 2013 against former dictator General Efrain R\u00edos Montt. The former U.S.-backed dictator was found guilty of committing genocide against the Ixil Mayan people between 1982 and 1983. Yet the decision was overturned in May of that year by Guatemala\u2019s supreme court. Further attempts to convict the former dictator ended with his death in April 2018.\nMany other cases have successfully convicted military officials, including sexual slavery of Q\u2019eqchi Mayan women in Sepur Zarco, Alta Verapaz, the massacre of the village of Dos Erres, Pet\u00e9n, and the forced disappearance of fourteen-year-old Marco Antonio Molina Theissen in 1981.\nOther cases are currently being investigated by Guatemalan prosecutors, including into the campaign of forced disappearance coordinated by military officials at the military base in Coban, Alta Verapaz, and into the rape of the Achi Mayan women. If the reform is passed, these cases will not advance and the victims and their families remain without justice.\n\u201cIf justice and the truth are a step towards not repeating [the past], then impunity is one step for the repetition,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThis is not about those leaving in twenty-four hours from prison, who are now old, but rather the impacts for future generations.\u201d\n}}

{{Americans are more frustrated than ever with the epic level of government polarization and dysfunction in Washington D.C. With the weighty 2020 election on the horizon, things are only getting worse.\nWhile our federal leaders bicker, posture and rarely think outside of party lines, our states\u2019 governors are setting long-term visions as well as responding to short-term and emergency needs in the best interest of their constituents.\nScott Pattison, executive director of the National Governors Association (NGA) told me there is a tangible shift in power where \u201cthe action is on the state and local level, which is a huge contrast to the federal level.\u201d\nThis past week, the nation\u2019s governors convened in Washington D.C. for their annual association winter meeting. Most of the 27 Republican and 23 Democratic governors and the five territorial governors were in attendance.\nUnlike the paralysis we see in our federal government, governors are more accomplished and reliable than the federal government at taking meaningful action. Working as former-Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s chief of staff, I marveled at how the private \u201cgovernors-only\u201d meetings were void of politics and focused on collaborating to solve problems.\nGovernors are more effective than our federal leaders for a few reasons.\nThey share data and ideas with each other to find the best practices and approaches to solving complex problems.\nThey share experiences in dealing with the unexpected. From fires, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes to cybersecurity threats, they collaborate on strategies aimed at preventing loss, saving lives and protecting their citizens. When faced with life-threatening issues they make split-second decisions. They emphasize emergency planning and preparedness.\nAnd, when a crisis occurs, they call each other and lend support.\nGovernors recognize that there aren\u2019t Republican or Democratic solutions to issues such as the opioid crisis. The greatest compliment a governor can give another governor is to replicate a program that has worked in another state. For example, I watched Hickenlooper take the idea of an office of outdoor recreation from Gov. Gary Herbert in Utah. The office played a major role in expanding economic and quality of life opportunities in Colorado.\nThis year the NGA held bipartisan sessions on a variety of significant topics. Panels addressed child welfare, state innovation in higher education, improving the way government interacts with citizens and businesses, how governors can leverage different approaches to education policy, and the governors shared their experiences and lessons around Medicaid expansion.\nAt this year\u2019s conference, there were robust discussions on how to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to address issues of importance. The governors had a closed-door session aimed at identifying trends driving health spending and the tools they had to manage costs and improve the health care system. This is one of the top priorities for Colorado\u2019s new governor, Jared Polis.\nGovernors also discussed how they can work with Congress to move forward a new federal infrastructure package. While in D.C., the governors identified a strategy and then meet with President Donald Trump, key members of his administration, and congressional leadership to discuss target areas of investment and reform to provide critical funding on a state and local level.\nGovernors are also more focused on the long-term horizon. They are preparing their economies today for the disruptive technological and innovative challenges of the future. They work together to adapt their learning programs to address issues like the emerging workforce skills that will result from the proliferation of artificial intelligence.\nThese are the CEO\u2019s of their states, running billion dollar companies and they take that role seriously.\nThey are transparent and accountable. They identify their goals, measure progress and provide data and information about their outcomes on state websites.\nThey are also approachable. I had the opportunity to meet with Gov. Polis, a Democrat, and Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican from Wyoming while I was at NGA. Two new governors from two different parties from neighboring western states. The governors share so much in common and both brought with them a keen interest in working together to find areas of interest and common goals.\nRefreshing indeed.\nWhile our federal leaders talk, our governors collaborate and act.\nAs a result, our state governments are doing a better job of serving its citizens and delivering results.\nDoug Friednash is a Denver native, a partner with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber and Schreck and the former chief of staff for Gov.

{{\nRep. Ron Paul, R-Texas\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Ron Paul, a maverick Republican from Texas, today denounced plans for the proposed \u201cNAFTA superhighway\u201d in his state as part of a larger plot for merger of the U.S., Canada and Mexico into a North American Union.\n\u201cBy now many Texans have heard about the proposed \u2018NAFTA Superhighway,\u2019 which is also referred to as the trans-Texas corridor,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhat you may not know is the extent to which plans for such a superhighway are moving forward without congressional oversight or media attention.\u201d\nPaul explained that most members of Congress are unaware of the plans because only relatively small amounts of money have been spent studying the plans and those allocations were included in \u201cenormous transportation appropriations bills.\u201d\n\u201cThe proposed highway is part of a broader plan advanced by a quasi-government organization called the \u2018Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America,\u2019 or SPP,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe SPP was first launched in 2005 by the heads of state of Canada, Mexico, and the United States at a summit in Waco.\u201d\nNo treaties were involved, and Congress was not included in discussions or plans, he says.\n\u201cInstead, the SPP is an unholy alliance of foreign consortiums and officials from several governments,\u201d according to Paul. \u201cOne principal player is a Spanish construction company, which plans to build the highway and operate it as a toll road. But don\u2019t be fooled: The superhighway proposal is not the result of free market demand, but rather an extension of government-managed trade schemes like NAFTA that benefit politically connected interests.\u201d\nPaul says, however, the real issue raised by the superhighway plan and the SPP is national sovereignty.\n\u201cOnce again, decisions that affect millions of Americans are not being made by those Americans themselves, or even by their elected representatives in Congress,\u201d says Paul. \u201cInstead, a handful of elites use their government connections to bypass national legislatures and ignore our Constitution \u2013 which expressly grants Congress the sole authority to regulate international trade.\u201d\nThe ultimate goal, he says, is not simply a superhighway \u201cbut an integrated North American Union \u2013 complete with a currency, a cross-national bureaucracy and virtually borderless travel within the union. Like the European Union, a North American Union would represent another step toward the abolition of national sovereignty altogether.\u201d\nRep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., has introduced a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the U.S. should not engage in the construction of a NAFTA superhighway, or enter into any agreement that advances the concept of a North American Union.\n\u201cI wholeheartedly support this legislation and predict that the superhighway will become a sleeper issue in the 2008 election,\u201d says Paul. \u201cAny movement toward a North American Union diminishes the ability of average Americans to influence the laws under which they must live. The SPP agreement, including the plan for a major transnational superhighway through Texas, is moving forward without congressional oversight \u2013 and that is an outrage. The administration needs a strong message from Congress that the American people will not tolerate backroom deals that threaten our sovereignty.\u201d\nRelated offers:\nFor a comprehensive look at the U.S. government\u2019s plan to integrate the U.S., Mexico and Canada into a North American super-state \u2013 guided by the powerful but secretive Council on Foreign Relations \u2013 read \u201cALIEN NATION: SECRETS OF THE INVASION,\u201d a special edition of WND\u2019s acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine.\nGet Tom Tancredo\u2019s new book, \u201cIn Mortal Danger,\u201d from the people who published it \u2013 WND Books.\nPrevious stories:\n\u2018North American Union\u2019 major \u201908 issue?\nResolution seeks to head off union with Mexico, Canada\nDocuments reveal \u2018shadow government\u2019\nTancredo: Halt \u2018Security and Prosperity Partnership\u2019\nNorth American Union threat gets attention of congressmen\nTop U.S. official chaired N.

{{On March 25, House Rep. Mike Pompeo (R. KS) introduced HR 1599: Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015.\nIt seeks \u201c(t)o amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to food produced from, containing, or consisting of a bioengineered organism, the labeling of natural foods, and for other purposes.\u201d\nCritics call the measure the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act. It blocks state and local efforts to require GMO labeling.\nCurrent Vermont, Connecticut and Maine laws requiring labels on GMO foods and ingredients would be null and void.\nThe FDA would be prevented from establishing a national mandatory standard. Current agency policy lets companies voluntarily label GMO foods. No major company does so.\nDARK Act legislation lets the industry-controlled FDA approve foods for sale under a system requiring companies merely to notify the agency about products \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to non-GMOs.\nLabeling genetically modified foods and ingredients \u201cnatural\u201d is willful deception. DARK legislation lets federal regulators define the term to include harmful to health GMOs.\nIt would block states from prohibiting \u201cnatural\u201d labeling for GMO foods.\nThe DARK Act\u2019s latest version includes a section instructing the USDA to set legal rules for non-GMO labels \u2013 a provision able to establish weaker standards than already.\nDARK Act legislation is a Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) initiative. It aims to keep consumers more uninformed about what they eat than already \u2013 including about the hazards of harmful to health GMO foods and ingredients.\nGMA and its member companies lobby Congress intensively to block GMO labeling \u2013 plus efforts against labeling ballot initiatives in California, Washington, Oregon and Colorado.\nEnacting HR 1599 would let food producers continue to use dangerous GMOs while denying consumers the right to know what they\u2019re eating.\nIn February, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D. OR) introduced HR 913: Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act \u2013 \u201cto require that genetically engineered food and foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients be labeled accordingly.\u201d\nBarbara Boxer (D. CA) introduced a comparable Senate version. They require labeling GMO foods and ingredients.\nGiven industry opposition, odds for passage are virtually nil. Mass consumer outrage is needed.\nOver 90% of Americans support GMO labeling. Congress won\u2019t mandate it without sustained popular pressure.\nThe Institute for Responsible Technology lists 10 reasons to avoid GMOs.\n1. Independent studies show they harm human health. They cause organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, infertility, and other longterm problems.\n2. GMO soil contamination is permanent \u2013 threatening the health of future generations.\n3. GMOs require increased herbicide use, increasing health hazards.\n4. Gene mixing from unrelated species risk dangerous unpredictable side effects \u2013 \u201cnew toxins, allergens, carcinogens and nutritional deficiencies.\u201d\n5. Government oversight protecting consumers is virtually nonexistent. Industry executives control federal agencies. Rules they mandate serve bottom line interests, not consumer health and welfare.\n6. Monsanto and other biotech giants promoted agent orange, PCBs and DDT safety. Now they\u2019re using the same phony research claiming GMOs are safe to eat.\n7. Independent research revealing GMO health hazards is suppressed. Scientists discovering serious problems are \u201cattacked, gagged, fired, threatened and denied funding.\u201d\n8. GMOs cause irreparable environmental damage. They \u201charm birds, insects, amphibians, marine ecosystems and soil organisms. They reduce bio-diversity, pollute water resources and are unsustainable.\u201d\n9. GMOs don\u2019t increase crop yields as fraudulently touted. In some cases, yields decline.\n10. Avoiding GMOs is the only way to help eliminate them altogether. What industry can\u2019t sell, it won\u2019t produce.\nYou are what you eat. The phrase has been around a lot time. It hits home hard today given the harm to human health caused by GMOs and other toxins contaminating the typical Western diet.\n}}
{{Recent polls show it's unlikely that independent candidate Larry Pressler can attract enough Native American voters to make himself the next senator from South Dakota. But as in the election at large, there is concern that Pressler will siphon traditionally Democratic voters away from Weiland. Even with a shoestring budget, Pressler has managed to orchestrate a tribal \"listening tour.\" He earned the endorsement of his longtime friend and Oglala Sioux leader Gerald One Feather before the leader passed away in August. And Pressler has made a slew of campaign promises targeted at getting Native American voters on his side.\n\"I have been on every reservation,\" Pressler, who is a former Republican senator from the state, told National Journal. \"I have done a lot of work over the years. I secured all kinds of earmarks for all of the tribes when I was there. I have worked pretty hard.\"\nPressler has built his campaign around a promise to create an \"international Native American Holocaust Memorial Museum\" in Wounded Knee, S.D., to commemorate the human-rights abuses that have plagued American Indians throughout the country's history.\nStill, some on the reservations say Pressler's record on delivering for Native Americans in South Dakota is inconsistent.\n\"Our elders are highlighting the fact that Pressler was not really there for Native Americans,\" says state Rep. Kevin Killer, a Democrat and a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe.\nDuring his three terms in the Senate, Pressler got mixed reviews from Native American leaders in South Dakota. According to Mother Jones, his support for legislation that forced tribes to pay taxes on newly attained land was unpopular in the state. And Pressler admitted during a debate in September that he wished he would have done more to reduce poverty on reservations when he was in the Senate.\nYet even though Pressler says he has just one paid campaign staffer working for him and no internal polls to estimate how he has been faring with Native American voters, his proposals have helped him win the endorsement of the Native Sun News, an influential Native American newspaper.\n\"I have been in this business for a long long time. I have seen Democrats and Republicans come and go,\" says Tim Giago, the founder of the Native Sun News. \"What I am trying to do out here is ask our people in editorials to please stop being locked into one party. Neither party has done you any good. Sign yourself up as an independent so both parties have to come to you instead of just being taken for granted like we have for years.\"\nGiago admits Pressler's presence in the race could fracture the Native American vote enough that Republican candidate and former Gov. Mike Rounds may reap the benefits of his endorsement. One Native American leader, Bryan Brewer, the Oglala Sioux president, says his biggest concern is that Pressler could cost Weiland a victory.\n}}
{{You won\u2019t need to read this article to understand that the use and use cases of mobile phones are growing. To see this all you need to do is look around you at the many individuals glued to their phones. However, what might come as a surprise is the numerous uses that are constantly evolving from our handle held devices.\nA recent study actually found that mobile platforms are the most popular way for Americans to play games. The online study was conducted in June using over 5,000 active US gamers and discovered that 90% of American gamers play games on their smartphones or tablets. The growing prevalence of mobile phone uses has encouraged a large variety of conferences, such as the Mobile World Congress Americas which is taking place at this very moment in Los Angles.\nOne of the conference\u2019s attendees is Sygic, a leading global provider of GPS navigation with offline maps, based in Slovakia. The promising company yesterday announced that its Sygic apps, used by 200 million people worldwide, are now available on Apple CarPlay and will be accessible with the upcoming iOS 12 release. The announcement was made by Sygic CEO Martin Strigac at the Mobile World Congress Americas in Los Angeles. Sygic is also the first navigation company to bring offline maps to Apple CarPlay.\nWhen a smartphone is paired to an Apple CarPlay-enabled vehicle, control of the Sygic app is removed from the smartphone. The app is automatically projected to the vehicle touchscreen and linked to voice controls, keeping drivers\u2019 eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.\nEvery day, approximately 660,000 people in the U.S. attempt to use their phone while behind the wheel, resulting in 1.6 million crashes per year, according to the National Safety Council. Sygic is taking sizeable steps towards combating the frequency of these accidents by utilizing car connectivity and subsequently reducing driver distraction.\n\u201cThere is a reason why we\u2019ve been pioneering car connectivity technology since 2014,\u201d said Sygic CEO Martin Strigac at MWC Americas. \u201cWe consider it the safest way for people to use navigation apps while driving, instead of mobile phones. The most recent integration with Apple CarPlay will allow for millions more people around the globe to navigate and drive safely.\u201d\nSome safety features of the Sygic GPS Navigation app, now available on Apple CarPlay, include: offline maps; advanced warning of speed limit changes; predictive routing that forecasts traffic congestion; a lane assistant that helps drivers more safely switch lanes; voice navigation and real-time traffic information updated every two minutes.\nAnother cool feature stemming from the integration with Apple CarPlay is that drivers can automatically sync their personalized Sygic navigation preferences and maps to any Apple CarPlay-enabled vehicle, which is great for company vehicles, car rentals and car sharing.\nSygic is one of the only navigation companies that supports all currently available car connectivity standards and the company hopes to work with the SDKs of other large car connectivity software developers in the future, like Android Auto, to further its mission to safely guide every driver in the world.\nCarPlay connectivity is coming on Sygic GPS Navigation and Sygic Car Navigation in couple days with the latest version of iOS.\nDisclosure: This article includes a client of an Espacio portfolio company\n}}
{{The Congress opposes a wall to stop illegal immigration to the US, but it's financing Israel's wall to keep Palestinians out of their own country.\nUS Senator Marco Rubio poses as a representative of Florida Republicans, but in truth he represents the interests of Israel. He is sponsor of legislation that punishes Americans who boycott Israel as their way of protesting Israel\u2019s genocide of the Palestinian people. That Rubio is doing his best to dismantle what little is left of the First Amendment doesn\u2019t seem to bother Florida voters or the presstitute media, who are no longer protective of the First Amendment.\nOn January 9, 2019, the legislation failed to pass the Senate because Democrats blocked it. But not really. The Democrats are not opposed to the bill. Indeed, the senators of both parties are too well paid in campaign contributions by the Israel Lobby to vote against anything that Israel wants. Moreover, they know that if they do, the money and the media support in their next election will flow to their opponent. The reason the Democrats blocked the passage of the bill is that they are making a point that no legislation will pass until President Trump gives in on the issue of The Wall and signs the necessary money bill to reopen the government.\nEvery 18 months the US government hands over to Israel enough money to build Trump\u2019s wall. Israel had no hesitation in using Americans\u2019 money to build its wall, which keeps Palestinians out of Palestine. It is OK with the US Congress for Americans to finance Israel\u2019s construction of a wall that keeps a people out of their own country, but it is not OK for Trump to use American money to keep illegal immigrants out of the United States.\nHow much more plain can it be? The US Congress represents Israel, not Americans. The US Congress will even destroy the US Constitution for Israel. And the United States is called a democracy?\nThis article was originally published at PaulCraigRoberts.org on January 10, 2019.\n}}

It plans to aggressively attack candidates whose policies it believes will harm the Latinos.\nIn an email, Ms. Mark-Viverito, one of the three co-chairs, said the super PAC was backing Nanette Barrag\u00e1n of California, Salud Carbajal of California, Pete Gallego of Texas and Darren Soto of Florida. Ms. Mark-Viverito, a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, is looking to become more prominent nationally, advocating for immigration reform and other progressive causes.\n\u201cThese men and women represent some of the most exciting and inspiring Latino leaders in our country today,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito said in a statement. \u201cThey each have a hard fight ahead of them to bring more Latino representation to our government\u2013and we\u2019ll need your help to get them elected.\u201d\nAll four Democrats are locked in competitive races. Mr. Gallego is a former congressman who was knocked out of office by Republican Will Hurd last year. With Democratic turnout expected to surge with the 2016 presidential race, Democrats are eyeing Mr. Hurd\u2019s Texas seat as a potential pick-up opportunity in their long uphill climb to retake the majority.\nMs. Barrag\u00e1n, an attorney and leading contender to replace Congresswoman Janice Hahn, was recently criticized by a top rival for lacking real roots in the Southern California district.\nMr. Soto, a state senator regarded as a rising star in Florida, is running to replace Congressman Alan Grayson, a prominent progressive making a bid to fill the shoes of Republican Marco Rubio, a presidential candidate. He is facing off against a Grayson staffer and has been knocked by liberals in the area for working too closely with Republicans.\nMr. Carbajal, the Santa Barbara County supervisor, has the endorsement of the lawmaker he is trying to replace, Congresswoman Lois Capps.

{{Sweeping reform to digital mechanical licensing is hopefully on the horizon.\nThe long-overdue Music Modernization Act was introduced to the Senate today. Sponsored by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), the bill is supported by a variety of music trade groups including BMI, ASCAP, the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association (NMPA), the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI), the Songwriters of North America (SONA) and the Digital Media Association (DiMA).\nOn December 21, an identical bill was introduced to the House of Representatives, where it was then referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.\nIf passed, the Music Modernization Act would establish a central entity to handle digital mechanical licensing. The entity would control a database identifying the songwriters and publishers that control each composition. Digital music services would be able to obtain a blanket license and gain access to every composition in the database. The digital companies would take care of the costs of the database, but the entity would be operated by publishers and songwriters. Mutually beneficial, this central entity would protect digital companies from lawsuits and would ensure songwriters and publishers are paid for their compositions.\nThe bill would also reform the current rate court system. As it stands right now, BMI and ASCAP are subject to the same two judges that decide songwriter compensation. In line with other federal litigation processes, the bill would introduce a \u201cwheel\u201d system: each rate case would be randomly assigned to a federal judge.\nThe Music Modernization Act would also repeal Section 114(i) of the Copyright Act, which currently prohibits rate courts from considering sound recording performance royalties when determining musical work performance royalties in regards to digital services.\nMoreover, the legislation would introduce a new approach to mechanical royalty rates. Mechanicals would be based on what a willing buyer and a willing seller would negotiate in a free market.\nNSAI\u2019s President Steve Bogard says, \u201cSongwriters will finally get a market-based mechanical rate standard, which should result in more equitable royalties from interactive streaming companies. Until now, we have been tied to outdated rate standards Congress first adopted for player piano rolls back in 1909. In addition, American songwriters will, for the first time, by law, receive at least half of all unclaimed digital mechanical royalties. I want to extend my deepest thanks to all of our introducing Senate sponsors. The Music Modernization Act represents the most significant copyright reform in a generation.\u201d\nThe act doesn\u2019t solve every problem facing songwriters in the digital age, but it\u2019s a start. BMI President Mike O\u2019Neill says, \u201cWhile we believe there is still more to do to protect the value of the performance right, we are encouraged\u2026 it represents an unprecedented cross-industry effort to introduce comprehensive music reform.\u201d\nDespite the cross-industry support and efforts, some trade organizations have spoken out against the Music Modernization Act, including Songwriter\u2019s Guild of America (SGA) and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). In a letter, SGA President Rick Carnes cites \u201ca number of serious problems\u201d as reason for his organization\u2019s opposition.\nThe bill has been in the works for over four years and was drafted after consultation with various industry organizations.\nRelated\n}}

{{After a tumultuous summer of back and forth debate between various players in the music industry, the United States Senate unanimously passed the much-talked-about Music Modernization Act.\nThe passage follows a contentious debate between proponents of the MMA and performing rights organization SESAC, the latter of which proposed an 11th-hour amendment to the bill that would have stripped the MMA of much of its power. Following heated backlash from the music community and from NSAI, SESAC withdrew its amendment a little over a week after its proposal.\nThe Music Modernization Act, first introduced to the Senate in January, is expected to benefit large swaths of the music industry in several key ways: the establishment of a streamlined entity, the Music Licensing Collective, to oversee digital mechanical licensing; \u201cguarantee[d] royalty payments for artists\u2019 songs recorded prior to 1972\u201d; a new streaming mechanical royalty rate standard for songwriters; and a process by which producers and engineers can also receive royalties for their work.\nThe MMA passed the House of Representatives and the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year.

{{By Heather Long, The Washington Post\nPresident Donald Trump flew to Missouri Wednesday to pitch his tax plan as a great benefit to the middle class, but a new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019 official scorekeepers, shows that many American families won\u2019t pay significantly less under the Senate GOP tax bill.\nIn 2019, 62 percent of Americans would get a tax cut of $100 or more, according to JCT. The remaining 38 percent would either pay about the same in taxes as they do now or get a tax hike. The information was shared with The Washington Post by a GOP senator\u2019s office. It is from a JCT letter that has not been made public yet.\nTrump has promised Americans \u201chuge\u201d tax cuts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas \u2013 hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present,\u201d he said last week.\nAmong the middle class \u2013 families with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 \u2013 JCT found that 80 percent get a tax cut of $100 or more in 2019, but 10 percent would pay about the same, and the remaining 10 percent would face a tax increase of $100 or more. Many of those people getting a tax hike probably itemize their deductions now.\nDemocrats have criticized Trump\u2019s tax plan as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy. Republicans have fired back that their plan cuts tax rates for everyone and makes U.S. businesses more competitive, which should lead to more jobs and higher wages. But while the Senate GOP plan does cut all individual tax rates in the coming years, it also takes away some popular credits and deductions such as the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The result is that not everyone gets a tax cut.\nThis latest JCT analysis sheds light on who gets a tax cut of a least $100 and who faces a tax increase of at least $100. Republicans will likely point out that a substantial number of millionaires aren\u2019t winners in this tax plan: Nearly 20 percent would see their taxes go up in 2019, according to the JCT chart. Democrats will likely highlight that the vast majority of the poor \u2013 those earning less than $20,000 \u2013 aren\u2019t any better off.\nWealthier Americans, earning between $500,000 to $1 million, appear to get the biggest benefits: 91 percent of them get a tax cut of at least $100. In contrast, 46 percent of the working poor, who make between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, would get a tax cut of at least $100. Many of the working poor filers don\u2019t pay anything in federal income taxes now, but some are eligible for refunds from the government where they receive money back, a tactic designed to encourage people to work. What JCT is showing is that only about half of those filers would get additional money in their pockets (a.k.a. larger refunds) from what they get now.\nRepublican Sens. Marco Rubio, Fla., and Mike Lee, Utah, proposed an amendment Wednesday that would give the working poor a much larger tax break, but a White House spokesman said the president doesn\u2019t support the idea because it would require a corporate tax rate of 22 percent instead of 20 percent to pay for the bigger benefit to those families. Senate Republicans plan to vote on their bill Thursday or Friday.\nThe Washington Post only obtained the \u201cwinners and losers\u201d analysis from JCT for 2019. Typically, JCT also does the same analysis for 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. All the tax cuts for individuals in the Senate GOP plan go away in 2026, so it\u2019s likely more Americans would higher taxes in 2027. Republicans argue that those tax cuts are likely to be extended by a future Congress.\nA similar JCT analysis of the House Republican bill found that 60 percent of Americans would pay $100 or less in taxes in 2019.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a mad dash to pass a bill that can\u2019t pass scrutiny in daylight,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Wednesday night.\n}}
{{In his introduction to the US-Russia Expert Panel prompt about whether Congress can be lobbied away from arming Ukraine, Mr. Doctorow mentions previous American interventions abroad that were \u201cwell-intentioned and even noble\u201d but ultimately \u201cresulted in catastrophe\u201d, such as \u201cIraq, Afghanistan and Libya\u201d. The strong issue taken with this statement is that the US\u2019 interventions there and everywhere else were and always will be anything but well-intentioned and noble, being driven by pure geopolitical power plays in each and every instance.\nIt\u2019s exactly this \u201cwell-intentioned and even noble\u201d mindset that has convinced the vast majority of Congress of the righteousness of arming Ukraine, and no amount of lobbying will get them to see beyond this perspective unless they themselves really want to. Suggesting that \u201cdevelopments outside the States, meaning from decisions made in Europe\u201d could have a positive effect on convincing Congress to pull back from its current course completely ignores the reality of American Exceptionalism and the fact that Congress may actually feel emboldened to arm Ukraine simply because the EU is seen as being \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018dilly dallying\u2019 over this artificially pressing topic.\nIt\u2019s important at this point to question the logic of even lobbying Congress against arming Ukraine in the first place, since President Putin has previously said that Kiev is already getting arms from Western countries anyhow. This shows that Congress\u2019 function isn\u2019t to call the shots in American foreign policy, but to function as \u2018democratic\u2019 window dressing for established deep state policies. To expand upon this further, the deep state is defined by the author as representing the permanent diplomatic, defense, and intelligence bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t cycle out of power whenever presidential administrations change. They represent a continuous and consistent force in shaping the application of America\u2019s foreign policy, hence why despite the regular shuffling of the state\u2019s upper echelon (e.g. Secretary of State, Director of the CIA, the President), the country\u2019s policies proceed unabated amidst these symbolic periodic transitions.\nThis is exceptionally true for American foreign policy against Russia, and one needs look no further than the new US National Security Strategy of 2015 to recognize both the power of the deep state and the futility of lobbying Congress against its dictates. The document explicitly makes it clear that Russia is now seen as a threat to American national security and that the US \u201cwill continue to impose significant costs on Russia through sanctions and other means\u201d. Specific attention should be drawn to the last part, \u201cand other means\u201d, which is an obvious allusion to hostile covert operations such as arming Ukraine. The die has already been cast when it comes to sanctions (see the certainty with which the document speaks about the continued imposition of sanctions without any reference to Congress whatsoever), so it should be no different when it comes to weapons shipments either.\nFinally, in the absolutely unlikely event that Congress passes legislation expressly prohibiting the arming of Ukraine, then the deep state, with the rubber stamping of the President, can resort to more surreptitious methods to carry out its preplanned shipments, with the Iran-Contra scandal immediately coming to mind. It doesn\u2019t matter what exact form this takes, but what\u2019s important is to acknowledge that \u2018where there\u2019s the will, there\u2019s the way\u2019, and the US deep state certainly has the will to continue pushing Russia\u2019s buttons and prodding it into a costly conventional intervention in Ukraine on terms which are controlled by Washington. The solution, therefore, lies not in fruitlessly lobbying Congress and impossibly reversing a fait accompli, but in accepting the reality of the deep state\u2019s overriding influence on foreign affairs and redirecting one\u2019s efforts towards more constructive endeavors, such as raising awareness among the population about this state of affairs and supporting independent media and political oversight initiatives that seek to shed light on it.\nAndrew Korybko is the political analyst and journalist for Sputnik who currently lives and studies in Moscow.\n}}
{{The Office of Congressional Ethics, or OCE, is an independent, bipartisan ethics panel and fact-finding agency that is crucial to protecting the public\u2019s interest in honest services and fair representation from government officials. It has limited yet critical investigative authority and an essential role in publicizing and deterring corruption. The office has been instrumental in successful prosecutions of lawmakers who violated ethics laws instead of working for Americans.\nIt is truly unfortunate that House Republicans attempted to start their period of unified control of the federal government by dramatically weakening one of the most effective anti-corruption and accountability tools that exists in Washington. Monday night in a secret vote during a closed party meeting, the Republican majority voted 119-74 to change the proposed rules for the next Congress and eviscerate the independent congressional ethics watchdog. Public outrage ensued, and after members\u2019 offices were flooded with calls in a few short hours, the majority dropped its attack on the OCE\u2014for now.\nThis does not bode well for the chances that the Republican majority will take any real steps to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and wrest government from wealthy special interests, despite the campaign rhetoric of President-elect Donald Trump. Clearly, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that Republicans are interested in real reform rather than in consolidating power. Removing Congress\u2019 one independent ethics watchdog would lay the groundwork for an explosion of political favoritism for special interests that can pay for access and influence\u2014the opposite of draining the swamp.\nAfter years of inaction by the House Ethics Committee\u2014which was known to sweep corruption under the rug and considered \u201cworthless for anything other than a whitewash\u201d\u2014the establishment of the OCE brought a period of increased accountability. The OCE was formed in 2008 at the recommendation of a bipartisan congressional taskforce on ethics enforcement after major corruption scandals in which three members of Congress went to jail: Former Rep. Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham (R-CA) spent seven years in prison on bribery and other charges; former Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), charged in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, served 30 months in jail after pleading guilty to corruption; and former Rep. William Jefferson (D-LA) was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison.\nHistorically, the House Ethics Committee failed to adequately investigate, punish, and deter members\u2019 misconduct. In nearly a decade prior to the wide-ranging Abramoff lobbying corruption scandal, the House Ethics Committee had only taken five disciplinary actions, a number that was matched in the three years of the Abramoff scandal. A 2014 study of the OCE showed that in the five years after it commenced working, from 2009 to 2014, the House Ethics Committee took 20 disciplinary actions. The OCE facilitated the effectiveness of the House Ethics Committee by striking a balance and using appropriate discretion in its work: 64 percent of complaints received have been dismissed or closed, and 49 reviews resulted in referrals to the House Ethics Committee, 46 of which are publicly available. One of the most important parts of the OCE process is that much of its work is publicly available. Its core mission is to \u201cassist the U.S. House in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.\u201d\nThere are many examples of the OCE\u2019s important work:\nIn 2010, the OCE looked into allegations that then-Rep. Nathan Deal (R-GA) was using his official position to assist a company he owned in Georgia. He resigned before the House Ethics Committee took action, but the OCE released findings that there was substantial reason to believe that Deal had violated ethics laws. Deal was running for governor of Georgia at the time the report was released. His unethical conduct would have remained hidden from voters had the OCE not made its findings public.\nRep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) resigned in 2015 after the OCE found that he engaged in campaign finance violations. He was indicted in November 2016 on charges of misusing public and campaign funds for his own personal benefit, causing a loss of more than $100,000. He has denied the allegations.\nIn 2009, the OCE reviewed allegations that Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-IL) had tried to make payments to obtain President Barack Obama\u2019s former seat representing Illinois in the U.S. Senate. The OCE also found that staff resources were used in the effort to secure the Senate seat, potentially violating federal law. The OCE recommended further review, and in 2011, the House Committee on Ethics stated it would review the allegations and published the OCE report. Rep. Jackson resigned from Congress in 2012 and, in 2013, pled guilty to wire and mail fraud and misusing $750,000 in campaign funds on private expenses. He was sentenced to federal prison for 2.5 years.\nIn 2015, Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-KY) announced he would not seek re-election amid an investigation of his wife\u2019s lobbying access. She was a registered lobbyist for the Humane Society Legislative Fund. The OCE investigated whether his wife lobbied Rep. Whitfield or his staff and concluded that she was granted \u201cspecial favors or privileges.\u201d In 2014, the OCE recommended that the House Committee on Ethics review the allegations; later that year, the committee agreed to continue gathering information, released the OCE report, and announced a further review. In 2016, the committee found that Rep. Whitfield violated the House rules and standard of conduct and reproved him.\nThe OCE investigated Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) in 2013 for improper use of campaign funds. The OCE recommended that the House Committee on Ethics further review the abuse of funds from her leadership PAC and use of campaign funds and improper contributions to promote her book. The OCE recommended the committee dismiss the charge that Rep. Bachmann filed false reports of campaign spending. The Committee on Ethics stated it would continue gathering information and pursuing allegations and published the OCE report. In a separate action related to her 2011 presidential campaign in Iowa, one of her staff members ultimately pled guilty to campaign finance violations.\nIn what was described as \u201cthe most extensive investigation undertaken by the ethics office,\u201d the OCE investigated a 2013 trip to Azerbaijan in which the Azerbaijan state oil company sponsored travel for 10 members of Congress in violation of federal law. This occurred as the company was seeking exemptions from sanctions on Iran for its $28 billion pipeline. In this instance, investigators found no evidence that the lawmakers knew that a foreign government was funding the conference. Still, now is not the time to lower America\u2019s guard against improper foreign influence and conflicts of interest.\nIn addition to these efforts, having a cop on the beat for Congress helps deter unethical behavior and violations that could result in inefficient use of taxpayer money and other fraud and abuse. It is worth reflecting that political scandal, government corruption, and a loss of fair representation incur real costs borne by real people.\nIt was particularly ugly that this attack on ethics enforcement and transparency came in a secret meeting on a holiday the night before the floor vote on the package that would have made stripping ethics the first act of the new Republican Congress. But there is every reason to believe that the majority will be back to hobble the OCE\u2019s power to prevent and punish corruption in Congress later in the year. After all, many of those who sought to end the agency this week have found their own behavior scrutinized by the OCE. According to The New York Times, that included:\nRepresentative Blake Farenthold of Texas, who had been investigated by the O.C.E. for sexual harassment. Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, who came under O.C.E. scrutiny after he and his wife took a $24,000 trip to Taiwan, which appeared to have been paid for, improperly, by the Taiwanese government. Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, who was the ranking member of the House Committee on Small Business in 2009 when he invited expert testimony on the renewable fuels industry from a representative of a renewable fuels business in which his wife had a financial stake, a potential conflict of interest. And Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico, who last year tried to eliminate the O.C.E.\u2019s entire budget after it investigated one of his staff members. None of these lawmakers or staff members were sanctioned, by the way\u2014they just didn\u2019t like the scrutiny.\nA little noticed but potentially very problematic rules change did make it through. The Republicans have, for the first time, given all committees subpoena power to call in private citizens to sit for staff depositions without having a member of Congress present. So while a majority of House Republicans attempted to kill the independent office that investigates members of Congress, they also substantially increased their own power to investigate and prosecute private American citizens. Parallels with the Watergate and McCarthy eras are hard to avoid.\nPublic outcry ultimately caused House Republicans to pull back from this ethics nosedive. However, this action is a terrible sign that points to House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-WI) abandonment of any commitment to take seriously the anti-corruption and pro-ethics promises made by President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign. Importantly, this move by House majority leaders begs the question: What does this mean for accountability and oversight in Washington, D.C., on the eve of President-elect Trump\u2019s inauguration?\nLiz Kennedy is the Director of Democracy and Government Reform at the Center for American Progress.\n}}
{{The United States Senate took a swipe at the spirit of May Day in a spectacular show of callous indifference when it voted down a bill to provide limited assistance to citizens at risk for losing their homes. The final vote was 45 in favor, 51 opposed to Senator Richard Durbin\u2019s (D-IL) mortgage assistance bill. The original version of the bill covered some but not all of those requiring assistance. The final version was even more restricted. It applied to only homeowners currently in foreclosure as a result of actions prior to the start of 2009.\nThe denial of assistance to citizens by Senators is ironic given the fact that the origins of the current economic crisis came from Senate legislative actions in 1999 and 2000.\nWhile their avarice knows no bounds, their memory suffers.\nApparently these multimillionaire aristocrats of the Senate \u201cgentlemen\u2019s club\u201d haven\u2019t been watching the news. The International Monetary Fund declared that the United States is in a depression almost three months ago. Delinquency and foreclosure rates around the country are rising at spectacular rates. Unemployment has jumped by 3.3 million in the last five months. Economic growth has declined at a rate of 6.3% in the first quarter of 2009.\nWhat part of economic crisis can\u2019t they understand? Apparently all of it.\nMemo to stingy Senators: Workers and their families are in serious trouble or about to be in trouble. That means they lack the money to pay for their homes (also known as shelter, a basic human need). These citizens did nothing to bring on this crisis.\nYou, the members of the Senate, are largely to blame and you know it.\nOne of the most revealing remarks came from Democrat Ben Nelson (D-NE) who said:\n\u201cDo I want to have my rate go up so that somebody else might be able to cram down\u201d their mortgage payment?\u201d asked Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who voted against the bill. Associated Press, Apr. 30, 2009\nNelson has never been regarded as the sharpest tool in the shed but he\u2019s set a new standard for ignorance with this remark. Nelson was worth at least $7.0 million as of reporting in 2008. Obviously he needs to skimp on every penny to stay afloat. He\u2019ll offer no breaks for financially strapped citizens on the brink of ruin even if they are in trouble as a result of his support of Wall Street welfare. The bill would have no impact on his or anybody else\u2019s mortgage rate unless they qualified for help. In those cases, the rate would go down.\nThe Durbin bill offered a reasonable change in bankruptcy law that would allow those in foreclosure to ask (simply ask) bankruptcy judges to invoke a \u201ccramdown.\u201d In that process, the bankruptcy court would set a lower interest rates and longer terms on loans. This takes the case out of foreclosure and allows citizens to keep their homes and the lets banks collect the money owed at a lower rate over an extended period. (See this for a real cramdown to benefit all citizens)\nThe Durbin bill provided limited options since it presumed that homeowners at risk had the money to get in bankruptcy court; that the courts would be able to handle all those in need; and that the judge would accept the request for a cramdown to keep people in their homes. But the bill might have helped as many as 1.7 million homeowners.\nEven with those limitations, Sen. Durbin was forced against the wall and had to negotiate the bill to a lower level of protection. The final bill rejected by the Senate. Associated Press reported: \u201cThe latest proposal would have restricted eligibility to homeowners already in foreclosure whose lender had not offered better terms. Homes would also have to be worth less than $729,000 and apply to mortgage loans originated before 2009.\u201d Apr 30, 2009\nDurbin\u2019s last stand would have provided protection some homeowners but no there\u2019s now protection for anyone.\nWilliam K.

But if you leave the failed CEOs in place, it isn\u2019t just that they\u2019re terrible business people, though they are. It isn\u2019t just that they lack integrity, though they do. Because they were engaged in these frauds \u2026 they\u2019re not going to disclose the truth about the assets.\u201d Bill Moyers Journal, Apr 3, 2009\nSenators, you allowed changes in banking regulations that turned Wall Street in to a big casino for the \u201cin crowd\u201d and wiped out millions of small investors and retirement funds.\nYou failed to monitor the new freedoms you gave the banks and Wall Street after you stripped away citizen protections in law since the Great Depression.\nYou created the current depression.\nAnd now, you\u2019re so stingy you won\u2019t even help a few of the many people victimized by the massive corporate fraud schemes, Ponzi schemes according to Black.\nIs there any reason why even one single Senator of the 51 who voted down this assistance should remain in office to complete his or her term?\nIs there any reason to hold back from recalling them where allowed or demanding their resignations in every state that they represent?\nI can\u2019t think of one.

{{Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski has come out strongly against the SPR sales, saying in a floor speech Tuesday that the transportation-funding plan was a \"shortsighted sale that undermines our emergency preparedness.\n\"It would be a travesty to dramatically reduce the size of the SPR while continuing to ignore its maintenance and operational needs,\" Murkowski said.\nA committee aide said that the bipartisan energy bill shows that there's \"pretty much zero sunlight\" between Murkowski and ranking member Maria Cantwell on the SPR. The bill would amend existing law to say that revenue from SPR sales would be used for facility upgrades and other uses, while reaffirming that it should be used only in emergencies.\nBut, the aide said, the energy package would not override the funding plan in the highway bill.\nThe SPR has become an appealing piggy bank for lawmakers because the boom in domestic production means that there's more in the reserves and less needed to be on hand as an emergency supply. The reserve currently has 695 million barrels in its stockpile, according to the Department of Energy.\nThe reserve language comes as part of a more than 300-page bill unveiled Wednesday, the result of months of bipartisan negotiations over 114 bills from both sides of the aisle. The bipartisan deal from Murkowski and Cantwell would make reforms to energy-efficiency language, including efficiency measures for buildings, and has new language to tighten cybersecurity and secure the electric grid. The bill also contains a lengthy title on energy infrastructure, setting a streamlined permitting process for natural-gas exports.\nAs a Democratic priority, the bill would reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the program that uses offshore oil and natural-gas revenue to cover parks, conservation areas, and wildlife habitats. The LWCF is set to expire in September, and Democrats have been pushing for a long-term reauthorization.\nThe bill skirts controversial measures that wouldn't pass muster with either side. That means that some top-tier items like a repeal of the crude-oil-export ban is off the bill, although it is possible that Murkowski will bring it up as an amendment in committee or on the floor.\nThe release comes the same day that a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee unanimously approved its own comprehensive energy bill, which was also seen as taking a narrow scope that left both sides wanting more. There are some areas of overlap in the bill, but the Senate bill has a broader scope in part because the Senate Energy Committee has a larger jurisdiction than its House counterpart.\nThe Senate bill is set for a pair of markups on Tuesday and Thursday next week, and Murkowski has said she hopes it can reach the floor in the fall.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{{The Organic Prepper\nAt a House hearing yesterday, experts warned members of Congress that a North Korean EMP attack could kill 90% of Americans within one year, calling it an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d But despite this looming crisis, the Department of Defense has just defunded the Congressional committee that has been studying the threat since 2001\nThe Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack has been around for nearly two decades, but their efforts have mostly been restricted to making sure that the U.S. national command authority and U.S. strategic forces could continue to function. Meanwhile \u201cno major efforts were then thought necessary to protect critical national infrastructures.\u201d Apparently, the plan was that our defense would be so effective, no further steps were needed.\nThis has all changed with recent strides in nuclear weaponry by North Korea. The results of an EMP strike could be apocalyptic.\nWith the development of small nuclear arsenals and long-range missiles by new, radical U.S. adversaries, beginning with North Korea, the threat of a nuclear EMP attack against the U.S. becomes one of the few ways that such a country could inflict devastating damage to the United States. It is critical, therefore, that the U.S. national leadership address the EMP threat as a critical and existential issue, and give a high priority to assuring the leadership is engaged and the necessary steps are taken to protect the country from EMP. (source)\nWhat a lot of people didn\u2019t know was that just a couple of weeks ago, Sept. 30, 2017, the Department of Defense terminated the funding for the EMP Commission. At the same time, \u201cNorth Korea detonated an H-Bomb that it plausibly describes as capable of \u201csuper-powerful EMP\u201d attack and released a technical report \u201cThe EMP Might of Nuclear Weapons\u201d accurately describing what Russia and China call a \u201cSuper-EMP\u201d weapon.\u201d The EMP Commission has been urging EMP preparedness on a national level for 17 years, but no one has been listening, despite alarming strides toward that goal in just the past six months.\nRecent events have proven the EMP Commission\u2019s critics wrong about other highly important aspects of the nuclear missile threat from North Korea: Just six months ago, most experts thought North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal was primitive, some academics claiming it had as few as 6 A-Bombs. Now the intelligence community reportedly estimates North Korea has 60 nuclear weapons.\nJust six months ago, most experts thought North Korea\u2019s ICBMs were fake, or if real could not strike the U.S. mainland. Now the intelligence community reportedly estimates North Korea\u2019s ICBMs can strike Denver and Chicago, and perhaps the entire United States.\nJust six months ago, most experts thought North Korea was many years away from an HBomb. Now it appears North Korea has H-Bombs comparable to sophisticated U.S. two-stage thermonuclear weapons.\nJust six months ago, most experts claimed North Korean ICBMs could not miniaturize an ABomb or design a reentry vehicle for missile delivery. Now the intelligence community reportedly assesses North Korea has miniaturized nuclear weapons, and has developed reentry vehicles for missile delivery, including by ICBMs that can strike the U.S.1 After massive intelligence failures grossly underestimating North Korea\u2019s long-range missile capabilities, number of nuclear weapons, warhead miniaturization, and proximity to an H-Bomb, the biggest North Korean threat to the U.S. remains unacknowledged\u2014nuclear EMP attack. (source)\nSo, for 17 years, this group has been ringing the warning bell and no one has been listening. Now that the threat is at our doorstep, their funding has been pulled.Something doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe technology exists for a North Korean EMP attack\nA successful attack doesn\u2019t even require a Super-EMP weapon. The Commission concluded that even a primitive weapon could successfully render our infrastructure obsolete.\n\u201cTherefore, terrorists or state actors that possess relatively unsophisticated missiles armed with nuclear weapons may well calculate that, instead of destroying a city or military base, they may obtain the greatest political-military utility from one or a few such weapons by using them\u2014or threatening their use\u2014in an EMP attack.\u201d (source)\nBut that isn\u2019t the worst of in. In 2004, two Russian generals told the EMP Commission that their design for a Super-EMP weapon was \u201caccidentally transferred to North Korea.\u201d\nLet that sink in. Somehow, North Korea has had their hands on the design for an incredibly powerful EMP weapon for more than a decade. The report says:\nIn 2004, two Russian generals, both EMP experts, warned the EMP Commission that the design for Russia\u2019s Super-EMP warhead, capable of generating high-intensity EMP fields over 100,000 volts per meter, was \u201caccidentally\u201d transferred to North Korea. They also said that due to \u201cbrain drain,\u201d Russian scientists were in North Korea, as were Chinese and Pakistani scientists according to the Russians, helping with the North\u2019s missile and nuclear weapon programs. In 2009, South Korean military intelligence told their press that Russian scientists are in North Korea helping develop an EMP nuclear weapon. In 2013, a Chinese military commentator stated North Korea has Super-EMP nuclear weapons. Super-EMP weapons are low-yield and designed to produce not a big kinetic explosion, but rather a high level of gamma rays, which generates the high-frequency E1 EMP that is most damaging to the broadest range of electronics. North Korean nuclear tests, including the first in 2006, whose occurrence was predicted to the EMP Commission two years in advance by the two Russian EMP experts, mostly have yields consistent with the size of a Super-EMP weapon. The Russian generals\u2019 accurate prediction about when North Korea would perform its first nuclear test, and of a yield consistent with a Super-EMP weapon, indicates their warning about a North Korean Super-EMP weapon should be taken very seriously. (source)\nThe report says that while everyone is focused on the future, when Pyongyang may develop \u201chighly reliable intercontinental missiles, guidance systems, and reentry vehicles\u201d, a North Korean EMP attack wouldn\u2019t require that level of accuracy.\nEMP attack does not require an accurate guidance system because the area of effect, having a radius of hundreds or thousands of kilometers, is so large. No reentry vehicle is needed because the warhead is detonated at high altitude, above the atmosphere. Missile reliability matters little because only one missile has to work to make an EMP attack against an entire nation. (source)\nIt would be a strategic initial strike to take down the American power grid to disable the maority of the country before undertaking any other form of attack.\nHow would a North Korean EMP attack be likely to occur?\nPotential vehicles of attack are submarines or freighters, which could launch an EMP weapon to the relatively low altitude of 30 kilometers over the United States. Unsettlingly, \u201ceven a balloon-lofted warhead detonated at 30 kilometers altitude could blackout the Eastern Electric Power Grid that supports most of the population and generates 75 percent of U.S. electricity.\u201d\nA more likely choice would be a satellite.\nA Super-EMP weapon could be relatively small and lightweight, and could fit inside North Korea\u2019s Kwangmyongsong-3 (KMS-3) and Kwangmyongsong-4 (KMS-4) satellites. These two satellites presently orbit over the United States, and over every other nation on Earth\u2013 demonstrating, or posing, a potential EMP threat against the entire world. North Korea\u2019s KMS-3 and KMS-4 satellites were launched to the south on polar trajectories and passed over the United States on their first orbit. Pyongyang launched KMS-4 on February 7, 2017, shortly after its fourth illegal nuclear test on January 6, that began the present protracted nuclear crisis with North Korea. The south polar trajectory of KMS-3 and KMS-4 evades U.S. Ballistic Missile Early Warning Radars and National Missile Defenses, resembling a Russian secret weapon developed during the Cold War, called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that would have used a nuclear-armed satellite to make a surprise EMP attack on the United States. (source)\nThe report goes on to explain that our defense systems are completely unready for any of these scenarios.\nThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation about the threat of EMPs.\nThe report counters a great deal of misinformation about the threat of EMPs. While no one really wants to consider the devastating effects, many \u201cuninformed persons posturing as experts\u201d completely deny the possibility. However, the Commission says that the empirical basis for an EMP attack is better established than that of a cyber attack.\nThey offered numerous examples of hard data regarding the effects of EMPs.\nThe U.S. STARFISH PRIME high-altitude nuclear test in 1962 over Johnston Island that generated an EMP field over the Hawaiian Islands, over 1,300 kilometers away, causing widespread damage to electronic systems.\nSix Russian EMP tests 1961-1962 over Kazakhstan that with a single weapon destroyed electric grids over an area larger than Western Europe, proving this capability six times.\n30 years (1962-1992) of U.S. underground nuclear testing that included collecting data on EMP effects.\nOver 50 years of testing by EMP simulators, still ongoing, including by the Congressional EMP Commission (2001-2008) that proved modern electronics are over 1 million times more vulnerable to EMP than the electronics of 1962.\n\u201cRadio Frequency Weapons were used in separate incidents against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to falsely set off alarms and to induce a fire in a sensitive area.\u201d\n\u201cIn Kzlyar, Dagestan, Russia, Chechen rebel commander Salman Raduyev disabled police radio communications using RF transmitters during a raid.\u201d\n\u201cIn June 1999 in Bellingham, Washington, RF energy from a radar induced a SCADA malfunction that caused a gas pipeline to rupture and explode.\u201d\n\u201cIn 1999, a Robinson R-44 news helicopter nearly crashed when it flew by a high-frequency broadcast antenna.\u201d\nNorth Korea used a Radio Frequency Weapon, purchased from Russia, to attack airliners and impose an \u201celectromagnetic blockade\u201d on air traffic to Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital. The repeated attacks by RFW also disrupted communications and the operation of automobiles in several South Korean cities in December 2010; March 9, 2011; and April-May 2012.(source)\nThe threat is real. So, again, why would the Department of Defense withdraw funding from the Commission that wants to take steps to harden our infrastructure against this possibility?\nWhat would the aftermath of an EMP attack look like?\nThe Commission cited several examples of real-world electrical grid failures and their catastrophic consequences.\nThe Great Northeast Blackout of 2003\u2013that put 50 million people in the dark for a day, contributed to at least 11 deaths, and cost an estimated $6 billion\u2014originated from a single failure point when a powerline contacted a tree branch, damaging less than 0.0000001 (0.00001%) of the system.\nThe New York City Blackout of 1977, that resulted in the arrest of 4,500 looters and injury of 550 police officers, was caused by a lightning strike on a substation that tripped two circuit breakers.\nThe Great Northeast Blackout of 1965, that effected (sic) 30 million people, happened because a protective relay on a transmission line was improperly set.\nIndia\u2019s nationwide blackout of July 30-31, 2012\u2014the largest blackout in history, effecting (sic) 670 million people, 9% of the world population\u2014was caused by overload of a single high-voltage powerline.\nIndia\u2019s blackout of January 2, 2001\u2014effecting 226 million people\u2014was caused by equipment failure at the Uttar Pradesh substation.\nIndonesia\u2019s blackout of August 18, 2005\u2014effecting 100 million people\u2014was caused by overload of a high-voltage powerline.\nBrazil\u2019s blackout of March 11, 1999\u2014effecting 97 million people\u2014was caused by a lightning strike on an EHV transformer substation.\nItaly\u2019s blackout of September 28, 2003\u2014effecting 55 million people\u2014was caused by overload of two high-voltage powerlines.\nGermany, France, Italy, and Spain experienced partial blackouts on November 4, 2006 effecting (sic)10-15 million people\u2014from accidental shutdown of a high-voltage powerline.\nThe San Francisco blackout in April 2017 was caused by the failure of a single high voltage breaker (source)\nMy mind immediately goes to the down-grid disaster occurring right now in Puerto Rico.\nThe death toll from such a disaster would be unprecedented:\nThe result could be to shut down the U.S. electric power grid for an indefinite period, leading to the death within a year of up to 90 percent of all Americans\u2014as the EMP Commission testified over eight years ago.\nWe\u2019re talking about the deaths of more than 270 million people.\nPresident Trump signed an Executive Order in May called \u201cStrengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure\u201d which will hopefully harden our country against both cyber attacks and EMPs. The Commission provided a list of actionable suggestions on pages 11-14 of this report, but will the steps be undertaken before it\u2019s too late? Especially now that they\u2019re defunct.\nHow do you prep for something so massive?\nIt doesn\u2019t seem as though the government is very interested in taking steps to protect our power grid. We can look at what is happening in Puerto Rico as a glimpse of the apocalyptic future that would follow such an attack. Restoring power after an EMP could take multiple years, and things in America would never be the same after a sustained change in our way of life.\nThe result of an EMP attack would be a protracted blackout that would put at risk the lives of millions of people. Climate control, a lack of off-grid survival skills, looting, lawlessness, lack of medication, starvation, waterborne disease \u2013 all of these threats to our survival cannot be overlooked. If you haven\u2019t read the book One Second After, I recommend you do so for a fictionalized yet nonetheless realistic look at life after the grid. If that doesn\u2019t inspire you to prepare for such an event, nothing will.\nThe best resource for preparing for an attack like this is Disaster Preparedness for EMP and Solar Storms, by Dr. Arthur T. Bradley. A NASA scientist, Dr. Bradley has spent years studying the aftereffects of such a catastrophe. His book dispels many myths an provides realistic, lifesaving information. My personal plan is a low-tech one \u2013 I am not spending a fortune on generators and fancy gadgets I wouldn\u2019t be able to use once the fuel runs out.\nPreparing for something this massive is beyond the scope of this article. I strongly encourage you to begin researching and create your own low-tech plan. Don\u2019t put it off until you get your perfect homestead in the boondocks or you talk your family members into it. Disasters like this don\u2019t wait for a convenient time \u2013 in fact, strategically speaking, the less convenient it is, the more the attacker benefits.\nIf World War 3 starts off with an EMP, it renders many of our plans moot. We have been warned in the strongest terms possible, but will it be enough?\nWhat do you think?\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Why do you think the DoD terminated the funding for the EMP commission? Do you think that an EMP attack is a likely strategy for North Korea to employ?\nThe Organic Prepper\n}}
{{Rashida Tlaib made all kinds of history on Tuesday evening.\nAs the winner of a crowded Democratic primary in Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district, Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants and a former state representative, will almost assuredly become the first Muslim woman to serve in Congress.\nShe will run unopposed come November, save for a Republican write-in candidate who poses little threat to her election in a deeply blue district. She will succeed Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), who resigned last year following sexual-harassment allegations.\nRep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), the first Muslim elected to Congress, who is vacating his seat to run for his state\u2019s attorney general, told The Daily Beast of Tlaib\u2019s win: \u201cIt\u2019s historic, not only because people are standing up against Trump\u2019s hate and Islamophobia, but because of who Rashida is. She\u2019s a fighter for the things working people are demanding right now.\u201d He added: \u201cRashida is a friend, and I know she is going to be an incredible congresswoman for the people of Michigan\u2019s 13th District.\u201d\nTlaib ran on a progressive platform of Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, and a refusal to take corporate PAC money. Similar to Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old leftist who unseated a long-serving Democratic congressman in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district, Tlaib is a card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\nAnd so, as the presumptive winner this fall, Tlaib would join Cortez, another presumptive winner from a heavily blue district, in representing DSA among national lawmakers.\nOcasio-Cortez on Wednesday celebrated the Michigan candidate\u2019s victory by posting to Twitter an image of the two women together.\n\"Rashida Tlaib pulled off an amazing win, and will likely be the first Muslim woman and Palestinian-American to ever serve in Congress,\" Ocasio-Cortez told The Daily Beast. \"She will be a shining example for all Americans that everyone has an equal shot at leadership, no matter their skin color, where they grew up, or how they pray. I'm excited to be joined by another progressive woman of color in Congress who will fight for economic, social and racial justice.\"\nAsked about the prospect of a potential DSA-type caucus in the House of Representatives, Andy Goddeeris, campaign manager for Tlaib said \"Rashida hasn't had a chance to think about caucus or leadership decisions, but I'm sure we'll be talking through those things shortly.\"\nHe added that she \"enjoyed meeting AOC (Ocasio-Cortez) and is really looking forward to working with her in Congress - and wants to also help get people like Ilhan Omar to Congress with them,\" referring to the Muslim Somali-American legislator running for Ellison's seat.\nThe Trump era has been something of a boon for the Democratic Socialists of America. The organization has seen its membership surge to around 48,000 people nationwide, with some of its members winning congressional primaries and local elections.\nAmong those who\u2019ve achieved political success in the past year on the state legislative level are Lee Carter, who was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, and Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato, who both knocked off long-term incumbent Democrats in Pennsylvania.\n\u201cOur electoral victories on Tuesday night reflect the demands for true progressive changes across the country, not just in deep blue, coastal states,\" Catherine Hoffman, a member of the National Political Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America, said. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our movement at the ballot box in 2018 and building our momentum to bring true, material change to working people.\u201d\nTlaib could have joined the House sooner than 2019 had she won a separate Democratic special-election primary on Tuesday to serve out the rest of Conyers\u2019 term. That race was too close to call as of Wednesday afternoon.\nUpdate 6:20 PM: This article was updated to include comment from Tlaib's campaign.\n}}
{{By putting Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis in the hot seat Thursday, congressional lawmakers achieved one thing: They removed any doubt that navigating the financial crisis has been a messy affair for both corporate chieftains and federal officials alike.\nToo messy to be cleared up in a single hearing. It will probably require more public grillings \u2013 including of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \u2013 to resolve questions about the propriety of actions leading up to Bank of America's acquisition of the investment firm Merrill Lynch.\nThose questions include:\n\u2022Did federal officials, in an effort to contain a financial panic, put undue pressure on Mr. Lewis to go forward with the deal?\n\u2022Should Lewis have disclosed to the bank's shareholders, before they voted on whether to support the merger, that losses were piling up faster than expected at Merrill?\n\u2022Should Lewis have tried to back out of the merger, or renegotiate the terms, by arguing that those losses at Merrill represented what lawyers call a \"material adverse change\" (MAC) for the deal?\nLawmakers probed those issues again and again Thursday.\nAt times, Lewis emphasized the pressure he felt from federal officials. But he also said he and his team decided, on their own, that acquiring Merrill was a good move for the bank and its shareholders.\nHe said he thought Mr. Bernanke and other federal officials were acting with good intentions.\nAnd he sought cover on the question of whether he violated a duty by not disclosing more details on Merrill's performance ahead of the shareholder vote.\n\"I'm not a securities lawyer,\" Lewis said. \"When our lawyers tell us we have a disclosable event, we disclose it.\"\nMembers of the House oversight committee, comparing his answers with reports an earlier legal deposition by Lewis and with e-mails obtained from the Federal Reserve about the Merrill deal, repeatedly were unsatisfied with his answers. The said so in the bluntest terms.\nRep. Dennis Kucinich (D) of Ohio said the failure to inform shareholders \"could constitute a fundamental violation of securities law.\"\nMr. Kucinich also questioned who was pressuring whom. Some questions at the hearing focused on reports that federal officials threatened Lewis's job if he didn't go through with the Merrill deal. (The government has leverage both as a regulator of Bank of America and \u2013 since last fall \u2013 as an emergency investor in the firm). Other panel members, including Kucinich, tried to probe whether Lewis had sought to influence government officials. Bank of America got an additional infusion of financial support from the government not long after shareholders approved the Merrill buyout.\nCiting internal Federal Reserve e-mails, lawmakers also questioned whether Lewis was threatening to invoke a \"material adverse change,\" with the goal of getting a better price when the Merrill purchase was finalized.\nIn one e-mail, also quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Bernanke referred to Bank of America using such a threat as \"a bargaining chip, and we do not see it as a very likely scenario at all. Nevertheless, we need some analyses of that scenario so that we can explain to [Bank of America] with some confidence why we think it would be a foolish move and why regulators would not condone it.\"\nIn another e-mail, a Fed legal adviser warned Bernanke against giving Lewis a document opposing a MAC argument by Bank of America. \"We shouldn't take him off the hook by appearing to take the decision out of his hands,\" the e-mail said.\nWelcome to the messy world of bailouts and what one lawmaker called a \"shotgun\" corporate marriage.\nThe committee says it now plans to call Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for questioning.\nThe Merrill merger is one of the central events of the financial crisis, because the two firms involved are so prominent and because they agreed to the deal last September, at a time of maximum stress in financial markets. Merrill rival Lehman Brothers was in the process of going bust. CEOs of other financial firms were scrambling to ensure their survival. Federal officials were trying to save the economy from a devastating collapse of confidence. The Merrill deal was forged as all these parties held weekend meetings at the New York Fed building, in discussions that centered on Lehman's impending collapse.\nThe stock market was pointing to Merrill as the next investment bank at risk of failure, but Mr. Lewis saw a company with long-term strategic value.\n\u2013 Guest blogger Mark Trumbull is a Monitor staff writer.\n}}
{{A quarter of Americans \u2014 28 percent \u2014 said they want to repeal Obamacare completely, according to a poll by PBS NewsHour and Marist.\nForty-three percent of respondents said they want more from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, while only 6 percent said they wanted Obamacare to do less. Another 18 percent of Americans said they want to keep Obamacare as is.\nRespondents were sharply divided by party affiliation. Two-thirds of Republican respondents said they want to get rid of Obamacare altogether, compared to 5 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of people who identified as politically independent who felt the same.\nThree-quarters of Americans \u2014 78 percent \u2014 said they disapproved of how Congress has handled health care so far.\nAnd these opinions remained largely unmoved since February, according to previous Marist polls.\nThis comes after a summer of political haggling led by Senate and House Republicans failed to produce enough votes to dismantle Obamacare, despite multiple attempts. Many Republicans in Congress built their 2016 election campaigns on a commitment to undo the Affordable Care Act.\nThree-quarters of Americans \u2014 78 percent \u2014 said they disapproved of how Congress has handled health care so far. Only 11 percent of respondents said they approved of Congress\u2019 performance on this issue, and another 10 percent said they were unsure of how they felt.\nThat dissatisfaction resonated across political parties with widespread disapproval among Democrats (92 percent), people who are politically independent (80 percent) and even Republicans (67 percent).\nDisapproval among Americans about how Congress has performed on health care grew substantially since June when two-thirds of U.S. adults said they weren\u2019t happy with Congressional action on health care reform, according to a poll from PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist.\nThe PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll contacted 1,105 U.S. adults using landline and mobile phones between September 25 and September 27. There is a 2.9 percent margin of error.\n}}
{{But opinion splintered much more on who should take the lead role in driving the nation\u2019s agenda; in fact, the results suggested that many Americans might prefer a kind of multipolar Washington, with three distinct orbits of power checking each other.\nThe newly elected president, strikingly, did not top the list when adults were asked who they \u201ctrust more to develop solutions for the major challenges facing the country.\u201d A 35 percent plurality of those polled picked Democrats in Congress; Trump finished second at 26 percent. But when combined with the additional 20 percent who pointed to congressional Republicans, more adults looked toward the GOP than to Democrats. (The remaining 15 percent said they trusted \u201cnone of the above.\u201d) Even among Trump voters, a relatively modest 53 percent said they most trusted him to develop solutions; about one-third picked congressional Republicans.\nSheila Boeggeman, a homemaker and Trump supporter from Medford, Oregon, is one respondent who expects the new president to set the pace for Washington. \u201cI think that Donald Trump is not one to sit by and be passive, so I think he\u2019ll probably take the lead, especially just trying to set the tone, and from there hopefully everybody will work together,\u201d she said.\nBut Arleen Yeager, a former public-school art teacher who now makes prints and paints in Nashville, Tennessee\u2014and who supported Clinton\u2014remains dubious of looking to Trump for answers. \u201cI want to go crawl under a rock for the next four years,\u201d she said. \u201cTruly, the man has nothing to offer this country. Nothing. And I know these people all want a change and they thought he could bring change, [but] he has no political experience. He has nothing to offer. Nothing. And most of all, it just makes me so terribly sad. \u2026 I\u2019m not anti-Republicans \u2026 but this man is awful. Just awful. He\u2019s awful for everybody.\u201d\nThe latest Heartland Monitor Poll is the 27th in a series examining how Americans are adapting to the changing economy. The new poll focuses on reactions to the 2016 election, as well as the public\u2019s priorities and expectations for the new administration and Congress.\nSplintered loyalties were also evident on a subsequent question that asked adults whether they most trusted Trump, congressional Republicans, or congressional Democrats to handle 15 specific issues. As the chart below shows, on no issue did a majority of adults point to Trump. He scored best on one of his signature themes\u2014creating jobs\u2014with 42 percent saying they most trusted him to stop \u201cAmerican companies from moving jobs to foreign countries\u201d and 40 percent preferring him for \u201cnegotiating trade deals that benefit America.\u201d In both cases, that far outpaced the share of adults who looked first to congressional Democrats\u2014or, for that matter, congressional Republicans.\n}}
{{\nCongressional Republicans have been outraged that the U.S. Supreme Court has taken to basing decisions on international law. But when it comes to changing the rules of the Senate, they seem perfectly happy to act like Europeans.\nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will vote on whether to change the filibuster rule for judicial nominations. The current rule requires a three-fifths vote _ 60 senators _ to shut off debate and put an issue or nomination to a vote. That is, it requires a fairly broad consensus among the senators that an issue is ready to be voted on.\nThe assumption is that anything that cannot get 60 senators to vote for it may need more consideration.\nSenate Majority Leader Bill Frist and other proponents think that the rules should be changed to make it easier for the Republican majority to get its nominees, or rather President Bush\u2019s nominees, approved. They are saying, in essence, that the majority should be able to do whatever it wants.\nFrist seems to think he has been elected to the British Parliament, where the majority simply rubber-stamps the proposals of the prime minister. As long as the PM has more than 50 percent of the votes, he can do whatever he wants. But our institutions were designed to be different. We did not reject the British Parliament just so we could re-create the same system.\nThe Founders intended Congress to be more than just a rubber stamp for executive policies. They carefully separated our institutions to make sure that policy could not be dictated by a sectional or ideological faction. Any public policy needed to have broad support in the country. This is why both the Senate _ a majority of the states _ and the House _ a majority of the people _ must agree on legislation.\nIt is different with nominations, where the Senate alone must decide. The only thing keeping it from approving partisan, biased or unqualified judges is the Senate\u2019s own judgment and self-restraint. Because there is no House vote to check the Senate\u2019s action, the filibuster is even more important for nominations than it is for legislation. It helps to make the majority accountable for the nominees it approves.\nThe Constitution gives the Senate an independent voice in approving the president\u2019s nominations so that it will be a check on presidential power. The filibuster is an appropriate tool, consistent with the Constitution\u2019s requirements, for preserving the Senate\u2019s check. It gives the minority party the ability to insist that the Senate think carefully about nominations and to exercise its judgment.\nIt will not surprise anyone to discover that in the 1990s, the Republicans themselves resorted to the filibuster to stall President Clinton\u2019s nominees to both judicial and executive offices. Their current frustration and outrage is simply their discovery that the shoe pinches when it\u2019s on the other foot. In fact, the Democrats have been more moderate than the Republicans were _ while the Republicans blocked 60 Clinton appointments, the Democrats have filibustered 10 of President Bush\u2019s nominees.\nChief Justice Warren Burger once observed that \u201cconvenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives _ or the hallmarks _ of democratic government.\u201d The filibuster rule for nominations is certainly inconvenient to the Senate majority. But it should serve as a reminder to the Republican majority that its responsibility to America goes beyond merely getting the president\u2019s nominees approved.\nBecause they represent all the people, they must be sure that their power of confirmation is exercised for the broad public interest, as the Founders intended. That is why we make sure that no power in our system is unchecked. If the senators want to have a political system where they are not supposed to check the president, they can always move to France.\n(Jackson Barlow is a professor of politics at Juniata College, in Huntingdon, Pa.)\nShare this: Facebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nPrint\nLike this: Like Loading...\n}}
{{by WorldTribune Staff, November 29, 2018\nThe midterm election defeat of Republican candidate Young Kim in California\u2019s 39th congressional district shows how \u201cCalifornia Democrats have systematically undermined California\u2019s already-weak voter protection laws to guarantee permanent one-party rule,\u201d a former California Republican Party chairman wrote in an op-ed.\nKim, who would have been the first Korean-American woman elected to Congress, held a 14-point lead on election night, but by the time all ballots were counted one week after the Nov. 6 election, Democrat Gil Cisneros was declared the winner with 110,794 votes to Kim\u2019s 107,774.\nIn the open primary to fill the seat of retiring 13-term Republican Rep. Ed Royce, which included 17 candidates, Kim had the most votes (30,019) while Cisneros was second (27,469).\nIn a Nov. 27 op-ed for The Washington Times, Shawn Steel wrote that Kim\u2019s 14-point lead \u201cwas the lone bright spot on an otherwise dismal night for Orange County Republicans. But, over the next week, Republicans watched the first-generation immigrant\u2019s lead evaporate. With thousands of provisional ballots left to count, her commanding lead was underwater. She lost one week after the election.\u201d\nSteel, a former California Republican Party chair and California\u2019s current committeeman for the Republican National Committee, noted that \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of ballot box shenanigans. No need. Democrats know it\u2019s easier to erode voter integrity laws than to stuff ballot boxes.\u201d\nSteel reeled off the ways he says Democrats are eroding those laws:\nMotor Voter Fraud: Every person in California that interacts with the Department of Motor Vehicles is automatically registered to vote. The state\u2019s Motor Voter program has come under fire for double registering as many as 77,000 people and registering as many as 1,500 ineligible voters. The state\u2019s bipartisan oversight agency expressed concerns about \u201cserious problems with ensuring that the New Motor Voter Program works as intended and promised.\u201d In October, the Little Hoover Commission called for an independent audit of the program and warned that \u201cvoter confidence in a fair and legitimate electoral process will be undermined, if not shattered.\u201d\nBallot Harvesting: Illegal in most states. But not California. As if it wasn\u2019t enough for every person to be automatically registered to vote and receive a ballot, Democrats have made it easier for their campaign operatives to collect those absentee ballots. In 2016, state lawmakers eliminated the ballot protection law that enabled only a trusted family member to return another voter\u2019s ballot. Assembly Bill 1921 now allows anyone to return an absentee ballot. The law has encouraged campaign operatives to engage in coercive tactics. One Democrat voter described coercive intimidation tactics employed by a Democrat campaign in a 2017 special election, leading even the liberal Los Angeles Times editorial board to criticize the law.\nNon-Citizen Voting: California has expanded voter eligibility \u2013 with some communities granting illegal immigrants the right to vote. In 2016, San Francisco approved a measure that allows \u201cpeople in the country illegally and other noncitizens the right to vote in a local election,\u201d according to the Associated Press. This year, San Francisco spent $310,000 in tax dollars to register 49 non-citizens to vote in a school board election.\nInmate Voting: Alameda County organized taxpayer-funded voter registration drives in county jails to register a record number of inmates. California law allows convicted criminals in county jails, on probation, on mandatory supervision, on post-release community supervision, or on federal supervised release to vote.\nFelon Voting: By downgrading numerous crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, Proposition 47 has enfranchised tens of thousands of convicted criminals previously barred from voting while on parole. The state\u2019s prisoner early release program has also expanded the voter rolls. In 2015, 60,000 convicted felons officially regained their voting rights after the state refused to appeal a lower-court decision that would have denied them the right to vote.\n16-and-17 Year-Old Pre-Registration: This cycle also marked the beginning of California\u2019s pre-voter registration program for 16- and 17-year-olds. Of course, if every voter is automatically registered through the Motor Voter program, why would anyone need to pre-register? Pre-registration is a thinly-veiled effort to capture voters while they\u2019re young and more likely to identify as liberal Democrats. Of the nearly 89,000 minors that participated in the program, only 10 percent registered as Republicans.\nAbsentee Ballots Automatically Mailed to Every Voter: In 2016, California approved a new law that allows counties to mail every voter an absentee ballot whether they requested one or not.\nBallots Accepted Up to Week After Election Day: In California, voting doesn\u2019t stop on Election Day. Absentee ballots need only be postmarked by Election Day, with ballots counted that arrive up to three days late. If ballots are sent to the wrong county, the ballot is valid for an additional four days.\nSecond Chance for Rejected Ballots: Just 50 days before the election, Democrats snuck in one more change to the state\u2019s absentee voting laws. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 759, which requires elections officials to notify every voter whose ballot was rejected due to a mismatched signature.\n\u201cThis election, a 14-point lead wasn\u2019t enough for a Republican victory,\u201d Steel wrote. \u201cBy 2020, a 20-point lead on Election Night won\u2019t be safe.\u201d\nCheck Out Geostrategy-Direct __________ Jump Start the U.S. Media\nShare This Post!

{{Rep. Steve King , a Republican serving in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2003, is known for few things. Longevity: he's and eight-term Congressman, and being a racist, anti-LGBT, and a white nationalist: he's the one who attacked Hispanic immigrants by saying that for every Hispanic high school valedictorian, there are 100 who are running drugs across the Mexican border -- and they have \" calves the size of cantaloupes .\"\nThat was 2014, when he also warned, after Hurricane Sandy, that its victims will spend money they may receive from FEMA on \"Gucci bags and massage parlors.\"\nHe has said on national television, \"We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies,\" a clear reference to immigrants from non-European countries. He added: \"I'd like to see an America that's just so homogenous that we look a lot the same.\"\nCongressman King has publicly compared members of the U.S. Military who are transgender to eunuchs, while co-sponsoring a bill that would ban transgender people from being protected under existing federal civil rights laws.\nIn 2016 Rep. King King insisted that throughout history no other \"subgroup of people\" have contributed \"more to civilization\" than whites.\nLast year he predicted a race war between \"Hispanics and the blacks.\"\nMore recently, King this summer traveled to meet with Austria's far right political party that has historical ties to Nazis. And he did so on a junket paid for by a non-profit Holocaust Memorial Group.\nDespite all this, and so much more, King has never had to worry about his seat, which is in an uber-conservative Iowa district that is 95 percent white.\nNot until now.\nAs King's white supremacist and white nationalist beliefs are getting more attention, his financial backers, including Intel and Land O' Lakes, have announced they are withdrawing their support, in the wake of King endorsing a Canadian white supremacist.\nAnd a new poll finds that King is in a statistical tie with his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, for what is likely the first time in history.\n\"Forty-five percent of respondents in the online poll said they would either vote for the Iowa Republican if the election were today, or have already voted for him early, according to the poll conducted by Change Research from Oct. 27-29,\" The Hill reports. \"Forty-four percent of respondents said the same for Scholten.\"\nWere Scholten to beat King it would be a tremendous blow to the GOP and to the President himself. Trump has told supporters they must vote in next week's midterms, because they are voting for him. Even though he's technically on the ballot, this election is a referendum on Trump, and Trumpism.\nPresident Trump won Congressman King's district in 2016 by 27 points.\nImage by Gage Skidmore via Flickr and a CC license\nSee a mistake?

{{\"When you bring new people into the political process, you energize others to get involved,\"\u009d says Sayu Bhojwani, a Next America Perspectives contributor and the executive director of the New American Leaders Project. \"There's new energy that's being brought to the political process \"\u201c a level of optimism immigrants bring to this country.\"\u009d\nThe Latino- and Asian-American electorate is an increasingly powerful political force and are expected to play a key role in the 2012 election even if their voting turnout is low, according to the report.\nIn 2008, for instance, the Latino electorate was still under 50 percent, far below the two-thirds participation of black and white voters, according to recent data by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.\nBut the opportunity for both parties to broaden their appeal among these groups could prove fruitful to presidential candidates. About a third of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are still undecided, according to the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, a nonpartisan organization that urges civic participation.\nIn a way, the APIAVote report demonstrates what advocates and some progressive think-tank analysts have noted: As immigrants establish roots, they assimilate to mainstream America, embrace their freedoms in a democracy, and begin to vie for offices. Those from modest upbringings \"bring a level of understanding of what it means to be lower- to moderate-income (taxpayers),\"\u009d Bhojwani says.\nStill, Asian-Americans and Latinos remain underrepresented on Capitol Hill. Only 10 members of Congress are Asian-American, and according to the study, they may likely lose some seats, falling to eight. Latinos are poised to gain at least four seats, bringing the total to at least 30.\nLess than 2 percent of the 112th Congress is foreign-born, compared to 13 percent of the population. Today, 5,850 Latinos serve in elected offices nationwide. The number of Asian-Americans (568) is a fraction of that, the report stated.\nSome possible outcomes, according to the report:\nCuban-American Ted Cruz, a Republican, could become the first Latino elected by Texans to serve in the U.S. Senate. Taiwanese-American Grace Meng, a Democrat, would become the first Asian-American from New York to be elected to Congress, serving Queens. If elected, Republican Mia Love, now mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, would become the first Haitian-American to serve in Congress.\nBetween 28 and 34 Latinos are expected to win House races. In the Senate Robert Menendez, D-N.J., is expected to retain his U.S. Senate seat. With current Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and presuming Cruz's victory, that would bring the number of Latino senators to three.\nOf the 16 Asian-American candidates running for the U.S. House of Representatives, at least six are expected to win.\nIf as expected Mazie Hirono wins the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Akaka, himself a native Hawaiian, both of the Aloha State's U.S. senators would be of Asian descent: Hirono was born in Japan, and Daniel Inouye is the son of Japanese immigrants.\nFive of the six Arab-Americans running for office are expected to win. Only Joe Kyrillos, elected to the New Jersey Senate in 1992 and in a U.S. Senate race against incumbent Menendez, is expected to lose his bid.\nTwo Caribbean-American candidates are running for Congress. Born to Jamaican parents, Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., is expected to win her reelection bid. It is uncertain whether Love will win the hotly contested Utah's 4th District race against six-term Democrat Jim Matheson.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{{Greg Sandoval/CNET\nAT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, and other wireless providers would be required to record and store information about Americans' private text messages for at least two years, according to a proposal that police have submitted to the U.S. Congress.\nCNET has learned a constellation of law enforcement groups has asked the U.S. Senate to require that wireless companies retain that information, warning that the lack of a current federal requirement \"can hinder law enforcement investigations.\"\nThey want an SMS retention requirement to be \"considered\" during congressional discussions over updating a 1986 privacy law for the cloud computing era -- a move that could complicate debate over the measure and erode support for it among civil libertarians.\nAs the popularity of text messages has exploded in recent years, so has their use in criminal investigations and civil lawsuits. They have been introduced as evidence in armed robbery, cocaine distribution, and wire fraud prosecutions. In one 2009 case in Michigan, wireless provider SkyTel turned over the contents of 626,638 SMS messages, a figure described by a federal judge as \"staggering.\"\nChuck DeWitt, a spokesman for the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, which represents the 63 largest U.S. police forces including New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago, said \"all such records should be retained for two years.\" Some providers, like Verizon, retain the contents of SMS messages for a brief period of time, while others like T-Mobile do not store them at all.\nAlong with the police association, other law enforcement groups making the request to the Senate include the National District Attorneys' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, DeWitt said.\nExcerpts from court opinion in Rhode Island murder case \"Sgt. Gates sent a letter to T-Mobile in advance of obtaining the warrant for the T-Mobile phone records to ask the service provider to preserve the information that he expected to request by the warrant. T-Mobile produced the requested information on October 20, 2009, and the records show that Defendant's use of the T-Mobile cell phone was almost exclusively for text messaging. The results also reveal that T-Mobile does not store, and has no capacity to produce, the content of subscriber text messages. \"Unlike T-Mobile, Verizon was able to produce records with text messaging content in them. The content of the LG cell phone matches the photographs taken on October 4, 2009 by Det. Cushman, including a text message which reads, 'Wat if I got 2 take him 2 da hospital wat do I say and dos marks on his neck omg,' which is the message that Sgt. Kite testified to having seen that morning. \"Sprint/Nextel responded on October 13, 2009. It produced two preserved text messages, both of which were unrelated to this case, and no voice mail messages.\"\n\"This issue is not addressed in the current proposal before the committee and yet it will become even more important in the future,\" the groups warn.\nThat's a reference to the Senate Judiciary committee, which approved sweeping amendments to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act last week. Unlike earlier drafts, the latest one veers in a very privacy-protective direction by requiring police to obtain a warrant to read the contents of e-mail messages; the SMS push by law enforcement appears to be a way to make sure it includes one of their priorities too.\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the law enforcement proposal is to store the contents of SMS messages, or only the metadata such as the sender and receiver phone numbers associated with the messages. Either way, it's a heap of data: Forrester Research reports that more than 2 trillion SMS messages were sent in the U.S. last year, over 6 billion SMS messages a day.\nThe current policies of wireless providers have been highlighted in some recent cases. During a criminal prosecution of a man for suspected murder of a 6-year old boy, for example, police in Cranston, R.I., tried to obtain copies of a customer's text messages from T-Mobile and Verizon. Superior Court Judge Judith Savage said that, although she was \"not unfamiliar with cell phones and text messaging,\" she \"was stunned\" to learn that providers had such different policies.\nWhile the SMS retention proposal opens a new front in Capitol Hill politicking over surveillance, the principle of mandatory data retention is hardly new. The Justice Department has publicly called for new laws requiring Internet service providers to record data about their customers, and a House of Representatives panel approved such a requirement last summer.\n\"We would oppose any mandatory data retention mandate as part of ECPA reform,\" says Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. That proposal is \"a different kettle of fish -- it doesn't belong in this discussion,\" he says.\nAn internal Justice Department document (PDF) that the ACLU obtained through the Freedom of Information Act shows that, as of 2010, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint did not store the contents of text messages. Verizon did for up to five days, a change from its earlier no-logs-at-all position, and Virgin Mobile kept them for 90 days. The carriers generally kept metadata such as the phone numbers associated with the text for 90 days to 18 months; AT&T was an outlier, keeping it for as long as seven years, according to the chart.\nA review of court cases by CNET suggests that Justice Department document is out of date. While Sprint is listed as as not storing text message contents, the judge in Rhode Island noted that the company turned over \"preserved text messages.\" And in an unrelated Connecticut case last year, a state judge noted that Sprint provided law enforcement with \"text messages involving the phone numbers.\"\nAn e-mail message from a detective in the Baltimore County Police Department, leaked by Antisec and reproduced in a Wired article last year, says that Verizon keeps \"text message content on their servers for 3-5 days.\" And: \"Sprint stores their text message content going back 12 days and Nextel content for 7 days. AT&T/Cingular do not preserve content at all. Us Cellular: 3-5 days Boost Mobile LLC: 7 days\"\nSprint and Verizon referred calls last week to CTIA - The Wireless Association, which declined to comment. So did the Justice Department. T-Mobile and AT&T representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\nKatie Frey, a spokeswoman for U.S. Cellular, said:\nDue to the volume of text messages sent by our customers every day, text messages are stored in our systems for approximately three to five days. The content of text messages can only be disclosed subject to a lawful request. We comply with every lawful request from authorities. We have a dedicated team of associates who are available 24 hours a day, every day of the year, to handle requests for information in emergency situations. Law enforcement must be able to show that it's an emergency and complete an Exigent Circumstance Form prior to receiving data. If a situation is not an emergency, law enforcement must submit a lawful request to receive the data. Over the past five years, U.S. Cellular has received more than 103,000 requests in the form of subpoenas, court orders, search warrants and letters regarding customers' phone accounts and usage.\nHanni Fakhoury, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said he would be skeptical of the need for a law mandating that text messaging data be retained.\n\"These data retention policies serve one purpose: to require companies to keep databases on their customers so law enforcement can fish for evidence,\" he said. \"And this would seem to be done against the wishes of the providers, presumably, since...some of the providers don't keep SMS messages at all.\"\nLast updated at 9:10 a.m. PT\n}}
{{Public-opinion polls find public trust of Congress at near-record lows. The facts are damning enough, but many people appear ready to believe anything nasty about Congress whether or not it\u2019s true.\nA case study: The other day on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition, I explained why Social Security recipients won\u2019t be getting a cost-of-living adjustment next year. In short, the Social Security COLA is tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. That index hasn\u2019t risen over the past 12 months. Decreases in energy prices, among other things, offset increases in the prices of food, housing and medical care.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why a lot of people believe the cost of the things they buy are rising even if the government index isn\u2019t, and I heard from those skeptics. I was surprised, though, to hear from people protesting, many on social media, that Congress has been getting cost-of-living raises even when Social Security beneficiaries don\u2019t.\nThat isn\u2019t true.\nA 1989 law does call for congressional salaries to rise each year automatically with the Employment Cost Index for private-sector workers, but Congress has voted to deny itself that raise every year since 2010. Congressional salaries have been set at $174,000 since January 2009. (For the history of congressional pay, see a recent Congressional Research Service report) Congress hasn\u2019t voted to cancel the pending increase for 2016 yet, but there\u2019s time. Last year\u2019s vote didn\u2019t come until Dec. 16 and it didn\u2019t suspend the 2013 raise until Jan. 2 of that year.\nPresident Obama has exercised his power to give other federal employees, who didn\u2019t get raises in 2011, 2012 or 2013, an across-the-board pay increase of 1% in 2016; with adjustments to extra pay for workers in certain high-cost locations, the average pay increase will be 1.3%.\nEditor\u2019s note: This post originally appeared on The Wall Street Journal.\n}}
{{Yesterday, Tennessee representative Scott DesJarlais \u2014 quite possibly the worst person in Congress \u2014 endorsed Donald Trump. Watch the birds of a feather flock together:\nDesJarlais said in a statement that he cast his vote early for Trump ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary in Tennessee. \u201cWhile there are certainly things that I admire and respect in each of the remaining candidates, I believe Donald Trump is the candidate best poised to make America great again. As such, I was proud to cast my vote for Mr. Trump and look forward to supporting the eventual Republican nominee whomever that might be,\u201d DesJarlais said.\nAdvertisement\nIf you\u2019ve heard of DesJarlais, it\u2019s likely because he became somewhat notorious in 2012 when it was revealed that the allegedly stalwart \u201cpro-life\u201d politician had supported two of his ex-wife\u2019s abortions, had a whopping six affairs, and was caught on tape apparently pressing one of his mistresses to terminate her pregnancy. The Chattanooga Times Free Press has the details:\nA decade before calling himself \u201ca consistent supporter of pro-life values,\u201d Tennessee physician and Republican U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais supported his ex-wife\u2019s decision to get two abortions before their marriage, according to the congressman\u2019s sworn testimony during his divorce trial. Obtained by the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the couple\u2019s 2001 trial transcript also confirms DesJarlais had sexual relationships with at least two patients, three coworkers and a drug representative while he was chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper, Tenn. During one affair with a female patient, DesJarlais prescribed her drugs, gave her an $875 watch and bought her a plane ticket to Las Vegas, records show.\nAnd lest you think that DesJarlais has since reformed to become a man of sterling character, trial transcripts revealed that he lied to his constituents about taping his former mistress:\nThe 679-page transcript reveals new details about DesJarlais\u2019 interactions with a 24-year-old-patient, who claimed she became pregnant with DesJarlais\u2019 child during a short fling in 2000 and that the doctor later pressed her to have an abortion. DesJarlais, who is now 48 years old, admitted in court to pressuring the woman over the phone to get an abortion, but said the whole conversation was a scheme orchestrated by him and his wife \u2014 with whom he had reconciled \u2014 to get the 24-year-old to admit she was not really pregnant. \u201cShe goes, \u2018I will have an abortion. This will never be a problem of yours,\u2019\u201d DesJarlais said. \u201cAnd I think that she was trying to get me to pay her money and I refused to because there was no proof of the pregnancy.\u201d Under oath, DesJarlais said he and his wife recorded his phone conversation with the woman \u201cto find out whether the girl was telling the truth or not.\u201d That directly contradicts the congressman\u2019s campaign Facebook page, where he told supporters the phone conversation \u201cwas recorded without my knowledge.\u201d \u201c . . . [The] media wrongly reported that I recorded the conversation myself,\u201d DesJarlais wrote in the Oct. 12 note that was \u201cliked\u201d by 521 people. \u201cI was recorded unknowingly and without my consent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDesJarlais has a primary challenger \u2014 Grant Starett, a stalwart conservative whom I\u2019ve known since his days as a student at Vanderbilt Law School \u2014 so hopefully he won\u2019t have a chance to work with a hypothetical President Trump. But if DesJarlais and Trump do meet, they can certainly swap stories of past adulterous exploits.\nLadies and gentlemen, your Grand Old Party.\n}}
{{CHICAGO \u2013 As Americans watch yet another political drama play out on Capitol Hill \u2014 this time over whether to extend the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits \u2014 they have a question for Congress: Can\u2019t you all just get along? For once?\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Kids, kids, kids,'\u201d said Brenda Bissett, a lawyer from Santa Clarita, Calif., as she waited for coffee Wednesday at a Starbucks in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating that there\u2019s no compromise \u2026 I do it all the time.\u201d\nAround the country, people of different backgrounds, incomes and political leanings say they\u2019re angry and downright disgusted by the posturing in Washington after the House rejected a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut passed by the Senate, then both chambers adjourned for the holidays.\nIf lawmakers don\u2019t act by Jan. 1, payroll taxes will jump almost $20 a week, or $1,000 a year, for a worker earning $50,000, and as much as $82 a week, or $4,272 a year, for a household with two high-paid workers. What\u2019s more, about 6 million people could lose unemployment benefits, and Medicare payments to doctors would be slashed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another smack in our face for the working public. We just can\u2019t get ahead,\u201d said Mike Pryor, a construction worker from Aurora, Ill. \u201cIt seems like everything that Congress is doing is always against us \u2026 I mean, I\u2019m at a loss for words, and I just can\u2019t understand it, why they have to keep arguing.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, President Barack Obama urged congressional leaders to return to Washington to pass a short-term payroll tax cut extension before New Year\u2019s Day, then work later on a full-year measure.\nLeaders from both chambers say they want the other side to return, too, though they still disagree on whether it should be to negotiate a two-month extension or a one-year deal favored by House Republicans.\nMeanwhile, the public can only wait and wonder \u2014 and stew.\nAt Augie & Ray\u2019s, a popular eatery in East Hartford, Conn., the consensus among several diners Wednesday was that the partisan bickering was eroding their already shaky faith in Congress. To some, that was just as frustrating as the idea that their paychecks could shrink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s us, the average Joe, that\u2019s getting caught in the middle,\u201d said Ray Ramsey, a retired utility meter technician who works part-time for a medical-supply company.\nFellow diner Richard Longo, who owns a building-maintenance business, said he worries about the effect of the taxes on himself and his 30-plus employees. But he thinks there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around.\n\u201cI truly believe that if the sides were reversed, if we had a Republican president and a Democratic Congress, we\u2019d still be going through the same thing,\u201d he said.\nA payroll tax increase would come at a vulnerable time for some people who already have been affected by falling property values and, in some cases, state tax increases.\nSome expected to spend less on non-essential things, like dining out. And others said they were willing to pay more if it means reducing the deficit. But almost all agreed that the partisan acrimony and 11th-hour crises in Washington are getting old.\n\u201cIt seems they want to bring down everything to the last minute and then figure it out,\u201d said David Kaiser, a researcher at a Miami college who said a tax increase wouldn\u2019t affect him significantly.\nKaiser wanted \u201csome way to send that message to them: That\u2019s not what they\u2019re hired for.\u201d\nMike Raney, a maintenance and repair worker from Chicago, said he blames the stalemate on \u201cmisguided ideals\u201d among politicians of both parties.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say they mean well, but we\u2019re talking about politicians,\u201d Raney said as he ate a hamburger at a McDonald\u2019s in Chicago\u2019s Loop. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, especially for people who are just getting by. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making millions of dollars, but it\u2019s affecting other people a lot harder than it\u2019s affecting me.\u201d\nThe tax cut lowered the Social Security tax on incomes of up to $106,800 from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. It\u2019s meant a maximum savings of $2,136 for an individual.\nWithout a deal, Americans would begin 2012 facing a tax increase just as an election year begins. And many say the bickering has more to do with elections than economic ideals.\n\u201cThe way I see it is that the Republicans want Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d said James Edwards, an Amtrak conductor from Hamden, Conn., who was in Boston on Wednesday. \u201cThey are taking their patriotism and throwing it away, and they are hurting the middle class. They want to make sure that America is hurting while this president is sitting so they won\u2019t vote for him in 2012.\u201d\nAnaiah Spencer, a property manager from Los Angeles, said the deadlock is damaging people\u2019s faith in lawmakers.\n\u201cI have never seen a government this divisive,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIn the end, we both end up broke, and we wind up with an entire country of angry citizens who don\u2019t know who to turn to.\u201d\nGreg Kirksey, a pastor in Little Rock, Ark., said a payroll tax increase would be little more than an inconvenience for him, but others are \u201ctalking about whether to buy dried beans or ground beef to get their protein.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid because it\u2019s a political year \u2026 I\u2019m not thinking anybody\u2019s really got the guts to make the hard decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just keep putting a Band-Aid on, putting a Band-Aid on, kicking the can down the road a little farther.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Christine Armario in Miami, Shannon Dininny in Yakima, Wash., Robert Jablon in Los Angeles, Steve LeBlanc in Boston, Ben Neary in Cheyenne, Wyo., Jeannie Nuss in Little Rock, Ark., Stephanie Reitz in East Hartford, Conn., and Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Ky.; and AP videographer Robert Ray in Aurora, Ill., contributed to this story.\n}}
{{The Senate has passed a defense spending bill that bans moving Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States. This throws a wrench in President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise of closing the camp.\nThe $607-billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed the Senate with a veto-proof 91-3, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) notably casting a \u201cno\u201d vote.\nThe same defense funding package passed in a similarly overwhelming manner in the House last week, with a vote of 370-58. The legislation will now be sent to President Obama\u2019s desk for signature.\nThe president had vetoed the original version of the NDAA in October largely due to concerns about an extra $38 billion in war funding.\nCongress has also repeatedly thwarted Obama\u2019s effort to fulfill a promise from his first presidential campaign to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which is located in US-occupied territory in Cuba.\n\u201cWhy in the world you would bring these enemy combatants to domestic soil is mind-boggling. This is absolutely nothing short of gambling national security to keep a campaign promise?\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) said on Monday.\nHowever, White House officials have hinted that the president may use executive action to close the prison.\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any ongoing effort to devise a strategy using only the president\u2019s executive authority to accomplish this goal,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. \u201cBut I certainly wouldn\u2019t, as I mentioned last week, take that option off the table.\u201d\nIssues that both parties agreed on include the efficient maintenance and upgrade of the Pentagon\u2019s capabilities in the wake of perceived aggression around the world.\n\u201cWe must champion the cause of defense reform, rigorously root out pentagon waste, and invest to maintain our military technological advantage, and that is what this bill is about,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) said on Tuesday.\nAmong other things, the bill authorizes $300 million in lethal military aid to the US-backed government in Ukraine and extends a ban on torture to the CIA. It also grants the president\u2019s request for $715 million to help fight Islamic State (formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq.\nThe passage of the budget bill will avert a disastrous default by the United States and puts the next round of struggle over spending and debt until after next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections.\n}}

Norma Torres (D-Calif.), who was born in Guatemala, penned the legislation. In an interview with InSight Crime at the end of April 2018, she said she thought it was necessary to push the reform package because \u201cthere are people who are hindering the anti-corruption agenda.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see who these [corrupt] people are. Let\u2019s see why they\u2019re doing it. Let\u2019s see if they have connections to drug or human trafficking \u2026 I\u2019m trying to prevent [reductions in aid] and saying, let\u2019s not punish all those countries because there are people who are working to improve the conditions,\u201d Torres told InSight Crime.\nAccording to the congresswoman, there are more and more voices in Washington on both sides of the aisle in favor of reducing or eliminating aid to countries like those in the Northern Triangle because they do not see \u201ca real intention [to fight corruption], or the progress they expected.\u201d\nThe bill requires the Pentagon and the Director of National Intelligence to give the list of officials who are corrupt or have ties to organized crime to several congressional committees no later than 180 days after the bill\u2019s approval, which will be before the end of 2018.\nAccording to Torres\u2019 amendment, the list must include \u201cthe names of senior government officials in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who are known to have committed or facilitated acts of grand corruption or narcotics trafficking\u201d as well as elected officials in the same countries \u201cwho are known to have received campaign funds that are the proceeds of narco-trafficking or other illicit activities in the last 2 years.\u201d\nIt is not clear what type of sanctions the officials named on the list would be subject to. Torres said that the decision is in \u201cthe power of Congress, but we should at least know who [the corrupt ones] are.\u201d\nThe amendment is the latest in a series of messages from US political powers in recent months to the Northern Triangle\u2019s heads of state who have faced accusations or even formal investigations for acts of corruption and illicit enrichment. However, it is also very likely that such messages will get lost in the often erratic and inconsistent communication from Washington since President Donald Trump took office.\nInSight Crime Analysis\nThe political crises generated in the Northern Triangle by the severe corruption attributed to presidents and other government officials has only worsened in recent months, especially in Guatemala and Honduras.\nIn Guatemala, President Jimmy Morales has been confronting the country\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office and its United Nations-backed appendage, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comisi\u00f3n Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala \u2013 CICIG). In 2017, both entities accused him of receiving illicit electoral financing during his electoral campaign in 2015.\nThe confrontation, which has marked Guatemalan politics in recent years, took a dramatic turn when Morales demanded the departure of CICIG head Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, and more recently Swedish Ambassador Anders Kompass. Sweden is one of the main financiers of the international commission.\nIn addition, the so-called Bitkov case has brought the clash to Washington, DC. The complicated plot involves a Russian family detained in Guatemala for purchasing false passports, a tycoon who accuses the Attorney General\u2019s Office and CICIG of persecuting that family by order of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and two Republican senators \u2014 Marco Rubio and Chris Smith \u2014 who have questioned Guatemala\u2019s anti-corruption fight.\nIn a May 4 letter to President Morales, Sen. Rubio even announced that he was temporarily halting the release of $6 million in funding that US Congress had approved for the CICIG.\nSEE ALSO: InDepth: Elites and Organized Crime\nThe hostile exchanges have led to rebuttals from Rep. Torres and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT). Both legislators understand that mechanisms such as international investigative commissions and cooperation to strengthen prosecutors in the region have helped to set up legal cases practically unheard of in Central America in the past. And evidence to support their positions is growing as these investigations have now reached several former presidents and powerful politicians in the region.\nAfter the approval of the new measures in her amendment, Torres said in a press release that she sees it as a way of supporting the region\u2019s prosecutors.\nThe situation in Honduras, however, is shaping up to be even more convoluted than that of Guatemala. It has to do with control mechanisms that US Congress has already approved, including certifications in the Alliance for Prosperity plan created during the administration of former US President Barack Obama. The plan puts conditions on aid disbursement for the advancement of anti-corruption and anti-crime efforts.\nIn 2017, however, the effectiveness of these certifications came into question. The US State Department approved the release of aid to Honduras, certifying that its government had been \u201cfighting corruption and supporting human rights\u201d in the aftermath of a severely contested election marred by fraud allegations that saw President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez assume office for a second term.\nAlthough legislative measures such as those recently approved have given a voice to nascent efforts to tie the hands of corrupt officials, Washington\u2019s contradictory messages raise doubts about their real effectiveness.\n}}
{{SHARE\nA new analysis suggests the US congress is poised to push back against President Donald Trump\u2019s proposals for massive cuts in security aid to Latin America, adding to mixed messaging from Washington that is causing uncertainty for regional partners.\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS), the legislature\u2019s in-house research arm, recently published a report analyzing the differences between the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal and those of the Senate and House of Representatives when it comes to US assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal, released in May 2017, would decrease overall foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean from $1.7 billion in 2017 to $1.09 billion for 2018, a reduction of 36 percent that would bring regional funding to its lowest level since 2001.\nThe CRS report highlights that the dramatic proposed reductions are part of Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, which aims to reduce foreign assistance across the board while refocusing aid toward \u201cUS domestic concerns, such as irregular migration and transnational crime.\u201d\nHowever, the report notes that when it comes to aid to Latin America, \u201ccongressional priorities appear to differ from those of the Trump administration in several respects.\u201d\nSEE ALSO: Coverage of Security Policy\nFor example, the House and Senate appropriations bills propose some slight cuts in aid to Colombia, Mexico and Central America that are nonetheless significantly higher than the administration\u2019s proposed funding levels.\nIn the case of Colombia, the Trump administration requested $251 million to support the country\u2019s peace process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \u2013 FARC). The request represents a reduction of more than one-third compared to 2017 funding levels. The House, on the other hand, would provide $336 million \u2014 a 14 percent reduction \u2014 and the Senate would provide $391 million, the same amount as in 2017.\nWhen it comes to security and rule of law efforts in Mexico, the Trump administration again requested cutting aid by more than one-third, from $139 million to $88 million. In contrast, the House bill would cut just $2 million, and the Senate bill would provide $144 million \u2014 $5 million more than in 2017.\nTrump requested a 30 percent reduction in the budget for the US \u201cStrategy for Engagement in Central America,\u201d from $655 million to $460 million. The House would provide $615 million, a reduction of 6 percent. The Senate would provide $600 million, an 8 percent drop compared to 2017.\nAlthough the House and Senate are unlikely to cut funds to the extent that Trump\u2019s administration has requested, according to the CRS report, these proposals to \u201cscale back US assistance could have significant implications for US policy in Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d\nThe report argues that Trump\u2019s proposal to slash assistance could lead to a \u201cdecline in US influence in the region.\u201d In addition, the author writes that the cuts could lead to the Defense Department taking on a larger role in security cooperation, which some experts have warned could result in negative outcomes.\nInSight Crime Analysis\nThe congressional pushback against Trump\u2019s request for huge cuts in aid to Latin America underscores the challenges the administration has faced in establishing a coherent strategy for working with regional partners on security issues.\nTrump\u2019s calls to slash aid are likely aimed at appealing to his domestic political base. But the approach could risk further alienating important partner countries.\nFor example, last week, Trump threatened to stop providing aid to Mexico and the Central American nations of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u201cif they can\u2019t stop drugs from coming in.\u201d\nAs InSight Crime has previously noted, large cuts in aid could prove detrimental to efforts aimed at improving security conditions in these crime-wracked countries. Moreover, these consistent threats have raised concerns among key allies \u2014 most recently Honduras \u2014 regarding the future of security cooperation with the United States.\nSEE ALSO: Trump Stumbles on Latin America Security\nBut in spite of Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric, Ben Raderstorf, a program associate for the Inter-American Dialogue think tank, told InSight Crime that \u201cthere never was a chance of significant cuts on the scale the Trump administration requested.\u201d\n\u201cNothing seismic\u201d is expected to happen to 2018 aid for Colombia, Mexico or the Northern Triangle countries of Central America because the US Congress widely supports these existing programs, Raderstorf said.\n\u201cThe vast majority, if not all of [the assistance programs for these countries], have pretty strong defenders on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle, particularly Central America and Colombia,\u201d he said.\nLisa Haugaard, the executive director of the Latin America Working Group, a Washington, DC-based advocacy organization, agreed that assistance will remain relatively stable despite the slight cuts propsed by congress. However, Haugaard suggested that although Trump\u2019s first budget proposal was rejected by the legislature, the 2019 budget \u2014 expected to be presented next week \u2014 may \u201creflect actual administration priorities\u201d that could shake up aid.\n\u201cFor the first round it was more hot air than dramatic restructuring of assistance. The question is what happens from now on,\u201d Haugaard said.\n}}
{{The most heated moment of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday came during Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s (R-SC) time to ask questions. Graham was practically frothing at the mouth as he decried the \u201cunethical sham\u201d he believes Democrats are trying to pull by calling for a federal investigation into claims of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee. He reserved plenty of time to praise Kavanaugh\u2019s credentials, as well. \u201cHere\u2019s my understanding, if you lived a good life people would recognize it, like the American Bar Association has, the gold standard,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHis integrity is absolutely unquestioned.\u201d\nNot long after Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony concluded, this \u201cgold standard\u201d of character appraisal called for the nominee\u2019s confirmation vote to be postponed until the FBI could complete an investigation into Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegation. \u201cWe make this request because of the ABA\u2019s respect for the rule of law and due process under law,\u201d ABA President Robert M. Carlson wrote in a letter to Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA). \u201cThe basic principles that underscore the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI.\u201d\n\u201cEach appointment to our nation\u2019s Highest Court (as with all others) is simply too important to rush to a vote,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cDeciding to proceed without conducting additional investigation would not only have a lasting impact on the Senate\u2019s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the Supreme Court. It must remain an institution that will reliably follow the law and not politics.\u201d\nThe ABA isn\u2019t the only organization to take issue with Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony on Thursday. America Magazine, the \u201cJesuit Review of Faith and Culture,\u201d took it a step further by writing that the nomination should be withdrawn. Georgetown Prep, the high school Kavanaugh attended at the time of Ford\u2019s allegation, is a well-known Jesuit institution. \u201cDr. [Ford\u2019s] accusations have neither been fully investigated nor been proven to a legal standard, but neither have they been conclusively disproved or shown to be less than credible,\u201d the magazine\u2019s editors wrote. \u201cJudge Kavanaugh continues to enjoy a legal presumption of innocence, but the standard for a nominee to the Supreme Court is far higher; there is no presumption of confirmability.\u201d\nWhile we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a committed textualist, it is now clear that the nomination should be withdrawn.https://t.co/CXqVGkaTdY \u2014 America Magazine (@americamag) September 28, 2018\nOn Friday morning, Heather Gerken, the dean of Yale Law School, Kavanaugh\u2019s alma mater, wrote that \u201cproceeding with the confirmation process without further investigation is not in the best interest of the Court or our profession.\u201d\nDean Gerken Joins the ABA in Calling for Further Investigation. pic.twitter.com/SYAsVHwsi7 \u2014 Yale Law School (@YaleLawSch) September 28, 2018\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that Kavanaugh hasn\u2019t lied repeatedly throughout the confirmation process, especially as he was attempting to explain some of the notations made on his high school yearbook page. While questioning the nominee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) brought up the legal principle falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. Kavanaugh didn\u2019t know what it meant, so Blumenthal translated for him: false in one thing, false in everything. In other words, when a witness lies about small, trivial details, they cannot be considered credible regarding more significant issues. The same principle is laid out in the standard instructions given to juries: \u201cIf a witness is shown knowingly to have testified falsely about any material matter, you have a right to distrust such witness\u2019 other testimony and you may reject all the testimony of that witness.\u201d\nSen. John Kennedy (R-LA) was the last member of the judiciary committee to question Kavanaugh. Like many most of the other Republican senators, he didn\u2019t cede his time to Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor they enlisted to question Ford and Kavanaugh, and whom Kennedy worried would \u201cgo catwoman\u201d on the witnesses.\n\u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d Kennedy asked Kavanaugh. He said yes. Kennedy then asked him if the allegations from Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnik were true. Kavanaugh issued rambling denials to each claim. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent certain, senator,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo you swear to God?\u201d Kennedy finally asked.\n\u201cI swear to God.\u201d\nThis post has been updated.\n}}

{{In 2015, an estimated 2 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and more than 33,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, nearly 12 million Americans ages 12 and older misused prescription pain medication in 2016. What\u2019s even more alarming is that prescription opioids are often the catalyst for addiction to other drugs, including heroin. Three out of four new heroin users start out using prescription drugs.\nIowa is not immune to the devastating effects of opioid abuse. The Iowa Department of Public Health estimated that more than 200 Iowans died from opioid misuse in 2017. The Bureau of Substance Abuse reported that treatment admissions related to opioid use have more than tripled since 2005. The severity of the problem is acutely felt in Polk County, which has experienced an overdose increase of 89 percent over the past decade and accounts for the most opioid-related deaths in Iowa.\nOne contributing factor has been the number of prescriptions written for opioids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers in 2012. That\u2019s enough for every adult in America to have a bottle of pills. Prescription opioid sales in America have increased by 300 percent since 1999 despite the fact that there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain individuals report. However, there is a silver lining. The American Medical Association recently reported a 22 percent decrease in opioid prescriptions between 2013 and 2017. Every state has seen a decline, but more needs to be done.\nI\u2019ve worked on 12 bills with Senate colleagues during this session to stem the flow of opioid abuse and help those struggling with addiction. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I\u2019ve co-sponsored, supported and moved along multiple bills that will assist in the fight against the opioid epidemic while also serving Iowans. Bills I\u2019ve worked on tackle issues ranging from closing loopholes that allow opioid traffickers to avoid prosecution, keeping families together while parents seek treatment and rehabilitation, and expanding telehealth opportunities in Medicare so those battling addiction in rural areas can access the help they need. One of these bills, the Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine Act, builds upon the oversight work I\u2019ve championed for more than a decade by requiring pharmaceutical companies to report payments made to nurse practitioners and physicians assistants to the Open Payments database. This will increase transparency about any potential conflicts of interest.\nIn 2016, I helped lead to passage the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), a sweeping recovery bill aimed at addressing the nation\u2019s problem with opioids and heroin. I\u2019m glad to note that recently a Drug Free Communities grant was awarded through CARA to the Jones County Safe and Healthy Youth Coalition in Anamosa. That grant will greatly benefit the mission of that organization and will help stem the tide of substance abuse in that area. Also in 2016, I worked with my colleagues to pass the 21st Century Cures Act, which allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states like Iowa. The grants helped fund expanded treatment and prevention programs.\nThere\u2019s no question that opioid abuse and addiction is a serious problem in Iowa and throughout the nation. There\u2019s no quick fix. But there are measures that Congress can take to curb the cycle of addiction and help improve the lives of those impacted by opioid and other substance abuse. I\u2019m proud of the bipartisan work my colleagues and I have already accomplished, but also understand there\u2019s still a lot to be done. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll continue to pursue solutions for the people of Iowa who are suffering under the heavy weight of addiction.\n}}

{{Growing up, one of the the big news stories was about illegal domestic spying. Ford setup the Rockefeller Commission and we got to learn all about how spying on Americans is not legal and outside the powers of the federal government.\nSo what did they do? Bush Jr. wrote on a piece of paper that it\u2019s now legal to spy on Americans, passed it around for approval, and voila spying on citizens is now legal even without a warrant. But there\u2019s a problem - a big elephant in the room. Our president and our government do not have the power or authority to pass such laws or make such executive orders.\nWe have, in our Bill of Rights, a list of restrictions on the power of government - a list of things the government cannot do without a constitutional amendment. One of those limits is mentioned in the 4th amendment\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized\nAnd to reinforce that idea, the Supreme Court ruling in US v. Katz 389 US 347 specifically stated that those restrictions upon governmental power do cover government eavesdropping.\nSo, my question is\u2026 when will the press go back to reminding the people that these actions are criminal and the government is specifically forbidden from spying on its own citizens?\n}}
{{Democrats are salivating at the prospect of a 60-vote majority in the Senate, enough to override a veto and other procedural hurdles. They will almost certainly gain a commanding majority in the House. But environmentalists should realize the answer to their problems isn\u2019t that simple. Sixty Democratic votes would not be enough to break through the Senate\u2019s decade-long impasse on climate legislation.\nThe debate over the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act in May and June this year showed that a senator\u2019s party affiliation is less important than the nature of their state\u2019s economy. Ten Democratic senators from the Midwest and South wrote a public letter to Environment Committee Chair Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on June 6 expressing concern that the bill would cause \u201cundue hardship on our states, key industrial sectors and consumers.\u201d In particular, they worried about \u201cuncertainty in predicting the costs\u201d and the need to \u201chelp \u2026 regulated industries \u2026 reduce emissions as they transition from an old energy economy to a new energy economy.\u201d They asked for price relief for families and demanded that the final bill \u201censure a truly equitable and effective global effort that minimizes harm to the U.S. economy and protects American jobs.\u201d The BLW bill did include billions in \u201ctransition assistance\u201d for workers and carbon-intensive industries, but the 10 senators didn\u2019t consider it enough. Now, in the midst of the financial meltdown this fall, such economic concerns loom larger than ever.\nWithout these swing Democrats and some moderate Republicans, the U.S. will never take serious action on climate change. To get 60 votes and move serious climate legislation through Congress, \u201cgreens\u201d need to pay attention to their \u201cblue\u201d colleagues. The unions represent important blocks of organized voters with ties to senators, but they also provide key potential partners for environmentalists in gaining a workable alliance on this issue.\nA More Climate-Friendly Union\nAfter the failure of the BLW bill, I did interviews and research to find out how major labor unions stand on the climate issue. Despite early resistance, nearly all have moved significantly over the past two years toward recognizing the links between addressing climate change and creating good-paying jobs in the next phase of America\u2019s economy. Each of the major unions has somewhat different positions, but many of them could be addressed in the next round of climate legislation.\nThe Boilermakers and the building trades (like plumbers and plasterers and electricians) realized early on that a serious piece of legislation to transition the U.S. to a new economy would require huge numbers of government contracts to build the new infrastructure. New green buildings require skilled craftsmen, and a national effort to insulate the old buildings has the potential to create massive employment in their trades. They therefore early sought and got \u201cprevailing wage\u201d clauses (the Davis-Bacon Act) in the BLW bill, a point specifically mentioned in President Bush\u2019s June 2 letter explaining why he would veto it. When Boxer\u2019s office called a press conference outside the Capitol on that same day, it was these unions that stood behind her and the bill\u2019s other authors.\nThe United Steelworkers have been working for years with the Sierra Club in a \u201cBlue Green Alliance,\u201d and in the process have grown fairly supportive of the cap-and-trade concept. They\u2019ve recognized that it takes a lot of steel to make a huge modern wind turbine and the powerlines to move its electricity. The BLW bill contained a huge prize for both the unions and their industry: the potential to protect some U.S. firms through a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d on the price of incoming goods. In this model, if a good from another nation required more energy to produce than it would have in the U.S., its price would be adjusted upward at the border. The Steelworkers\u2019 leader in the Blue Green Alliance, Dave Foster, has often pointed out that Chinese steel requires three times as much carbon to produce as U.S. steel. Still, the Steelworkers did not end up publicly supporting the BLW bill for several reasons, including because it lacked a \u201csafety valve\u201d for heavy industries in case carbon prices rose too high. The union, which is now extremely diverse with workers from the cement, plastics, paper, and chemicals industries, also wanted more emissions credits given out free to energy-intensive industries to help them adjust to a cap-and-trade system.\nThe United Auto Workers opposed BLW more actively, with \u201ca more complicated list of concerns,\u201d as Paul Joffee of the National Wildlife Federation put it. In particular, the UAW wanted federal laws to supercede any state laws, like California\u2019s strict auto-emissions rules. With the U.S. auto industry so insecure right now, the union is in a largely defensive position.\nBill Banig of the United Mine Workers union was highly skeptical of politicians\u2019 pledges to help workers in carbon-intensive industries find new jobs. \u201cAny talk I\u2019ve ever heard about a \u2018just transition\u2019 is really nothing but a fancy funeral. \u2026 We\u2019ve never seen a transition program that helps a 50-year-old coal miner. Put yourself in his shoes.\u201d The United Mine Workers opposed BLW, but supported a competing bill by Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), since it had slow start-up, relatively loose carbon caps until 2030, and a safety valve. The UMW and the coal-mining firms don\u2019t expect much-vaunted carbon-capture-and-storage technology to be technologically feasible for at least 10 to 15 years, so they fear any plan that lacks time and big government research funding to develop carbon sequestration.\nSince it acts by consensus only, the AFL-CIO was deadlocked on BLW. The union set up an Energy Task Force in 2007, which pointed out that \u201creliable and affordable electrical energy, is the lifeblood of the manufacturing, transportation, construction and service industries\u201d and argued that we must \u201cmaintain diversity in the electric utility industry, by retaining all current generating options, including fossil fuels, nuclear, hydro and renewables, to ensure a stable, reliable and low-cost supply of electricity for the United States.\u201d In spite of these words of caution, the AFL-CIO is beginning to merge the competing views of its members into creative solutions and recognize the substantial job possibilities that will come with a major piece of legislation like BLW.\nThe Perfect Is the Enemy of the Good\nScience and common sense suggest we need an aggressive climate bill, but if one passes that is not built with strong consensus and participation by unions and progressive companies, we will see a massive backlash from industry, with workers at their sides.\nThe 2008 version of Boxer-Lieberman-Warner was never seen as very serious beyond the environmental community \u2014 it was viewed as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the real effort at climate legislation that will come in 2009. Whether it comes as one omnibus bill like BLW or piecemeal in several bills, now is the time to craft climate legislation the whole country can get behind. In doing so, environmentalists need to pay attention to the needs of workers, their industries, and their states, and come together on a workable, truly American solution to climate change \u2014 one that will help Americans who might otherwise be hurt as we push toward a cleaner, low-carbon economy. These people are not \u201cspecial interests,\u201d they are American middle-class workers looking at a terrifying future and wanting to replace it with a humane one.\n}}
{{A new Gallup poll seems to indicate that a significant number of Americans don\u2019t care very much about who controls Congress:\nPRINCETON, NJ \u2014 Two months ahead of the midterm elections that may very well change the balance of power in Congress, four in 10 Americans say the specific party that controls Congress matters a great deal to them, while 29% say it matters a moderate amount and another 30% say it generally doesn\u2019t matter to them. The 40% of national adults now highly concerned about control of Capitol Hill equals what Gallup found a month before the 2002 midterms, but is lower than the 49% seen in late October 2010. While the views of Democrats (including independents who lean Democratic) on this question have been steady across the three midterms \u2014 roughly 45% each year have said the party in control mattered a great deal to them \u2014 Republicans\u2019 concern has varied. Currently, 43% of Republicans (including Republican leaners) say party control matters a great deal. It was a whopping 61% in 2010, but that was up from 42% in 2002. The 2002 and 2010 elections were favorable to Republicans, as the GOP retained majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives and regained control of the Senate in 2002, and recaptured control of the House in 2010 with an enormous seat gain. Thus, while rank-and-file Republicans\u2019 concern about party control is not nearly as high today as it was in 2010, when Democrats controlled both houses, it is comparable to 2002 \u2014 which could suggest that conditions are still favorable for the GOP. Missing from this midterm trend, however, is 2006, which was a strong Democratic year. Therefore, it is not entirely clear how levels of concern on this question relate to each party\u2019s performance.\nAs this survey shows, these numbers generally have not changed much in the past several election cycles, although there has been a significant drop among Republican voters from the levels they were at in 2010:\nThe fact that Republican voters are saying that they don\u2019t care nearly as much as they did in 2010 about who ends up controlling Congress is, obviously, the most interesting in the poll. To some extent, I suppose, you could say that it is due to the fact that the GOP already has control of the House and is in no danger at all of losing that chamber this year. Beyond that, though, I\u2019d speculate that after 2010, Republican voters, which include much more than just the tea party base that has been the most vocal over the past four years, discovered that the enthusiasm of 2010 was somewhat misplaced. Notwithstanding the GOP\u2019s huge victory that year, the party has largely failed to get its agenda adopted on a national level, thanks to the fact that there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House and that Democrats still control the Senate. Winning the Senate in November would give the GOP some additional leverage over legislation, but in the end their ability to accomplish much of anything will be limited by the fact that there is a Democrat in the White House at least until 2017, which means that there will have to be compromises made and deals struck in order to accomplish even the most basic tasks that Congress is responsible for, such as budgeting.\nThis means, of course, that 2016 is likely to be another closely fought ideological battle inside the GOP among Republicans on both sides of the \u201cestablishment v. tea party\u201d divide for the Republican nomination. Indeed, given the fact that the GOP has lost four out of the last six presidential elections, and lost the popular vote in five out of the last six, it\u2019s likely that all parties of interest in the GOP are going to be highly interested in trying to win the White House back after eight years in the wilderness. As far as 2014 goes, though, Republicans don\u2019t seem to be any more concerned about who controls Congress, and that suggests that while we\u2019re likely to see Republican gains this year they will probably fall short of the wave we saw in 2010.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nAs for Americans as a whole, it\u2019s not all that hard to understand why the partisan battle over congressional control doesn\u2019t grab the attention of the general public very much. Poll after poll over the past several years has shown that Congress has some of the lowest job approval numbers in its history. Going back to the Bush Administration, the institution has excelled at little more than partisan vitriol and gridlock, and that\u2019s been with both parties controlling one or both chambers. It\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019d believe that it really doesn\u2019t matter whose in charge in the current political climate, and, in at least some sense, they\u2019re absolutely right.\nDoug Mataconis appears on the Outside the Beltway blog at http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/\n}}
{{WASHINGTON -- More than 24 years ago, Wayne T. Gilchrest left Vietnam on a stretcher after being seriously wounded by a North Vietnamese soldier.\nNow a congressman from Washington, Gilchrest will return to Vietnam next month -- to try and find out if any of his former comrades were left behind. It is not a duty the ex-Marine takes lightly.\n\"I think all Vietnam veterans share a certain closeness with each other and a certain sense of loss,\" said Gilchrest, R-1st. \"Because of the configuration of the war and because [we] understand the terrain, the people and the culture, there remains a possibility that there are people alive.\"\nBut Gilchrest does not want to raise false hopes in the families of the 2,302 American soldiers -- 35 from Maryland -- unaccounted for from the Vietnam war.\n\"I don't want to . . . [have] them think that we're going to find a husband or a son, but we're dedicated to doing what's necessary to bring this situation to as close to a resolution as possible,\" he said.\nGilchrest and five other congressmen who are Vietnam-era veterans -- Reps. Tom Carper, D-Del.; Douglas \"Pete\" Peterson, D-Fla.; John J. Rhodes 3rd, R-Ariz.; David Skaggs, D-Colo.; and Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. -- are to leave Saturday. They are to travel to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand and return on Aug. 10.\n\"This a pretty clean group,\" Gilchrest said of those accompanying him. \"This is six veterans that have a real stake not only in the issue of the MIAs, but in bringing stability to Southeast Asia.\"\nThe delegation is going at the request of the State Department.\nQuestions about Americans who may still be in Vietnam and Laos were raised again recently with the circulation of a photograph bearing a 1990 date and seeming to show three Americans still being held in Indochina.\nRelatives of the men in the picture have positively identified them.\nThe Pentagon, however, is skeptical about the picture. It said Thursday that the photo of the three men had passed through the hands of a \"ring of Cambodian opportunists led by a well-known and admitted fabricator\" of information about missing Americans.\n}}
{{Coalition Calls on Congress to End Secret Arbitration for Sexual Harassment Claims\nChicago \u2014(ENEWSPF)\u2014February 13, 2018\nBy: Rosemary Piser\nAttorney General Lisa Madigan joined a coalition of 56 states and territories to urge Congress to protect American employees and put a stop to secret, forced arbitration in cases of workplace sexual harassment. The coalition sent a letter yesterday to Congressional leaders urging them to pass strong legislation to ensure sexual harassment victims have a right to be heard in court. Many employers require employees to sign employment contracts containing arbitration agreements mandating that sexual harassment claims be resolved through private arbitration instead of the judicial process. The secrecy surrounding these proceedings protects serial violators and provides inadequate relief to victims.\nAttorney General Madigan said, \u201cToo many victims of sexual harassment feel their voice will not be heard if they come forward. We must change our law so anyone who experiences sexual harassment at work is protected and supported.\u201d\nThe letter states, in part:\n\u201cCongress today has both opportunity and cause to champion the rights of victims of sexual harassment in the workplace by enacting legislation to free them from the injustice of forced arbitration and secrecy when it comes to seeking redress from egregious misconduct condemned by all concerned Americans.\u201d\nJoining Madigan in sending the letter were Attorneys General from: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.\nSource: www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov\n}}
{{Health Care Reform - Can't Live With It, or Without It\nOverview\nAs the day of reckoning for health care reform approaches, Americans have little to cheer about. Nearly everyone (92%) gives the national economy a negative rating. Closer to home, 85% say that jobs are hard to find in their community. A majority (54%) now says that someone in their household has been without a job or looking for work in the past year, compared with 39% in February 2009. And the proportion saying they got a pay raise or a better job in the past year fell from 41% in January 2008 to 24% currently.\nPublic gloom about the economy and personal finances extends to opinions about the future of health care costs. Regardless of what happens with the health care bills this week, Americans expect their own health care costs to rise in the coming years. While 51% say their health care costs would increase if the proposed legislation becomes law, even more (63%) believe their health care costs will increase if no changes are made to the health care system.\nThe latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted March 10-14 among 1,500 adults, finds that public views of the health care bills before Congress remain more negative than positive \u2013 48% generally oppose the bills before Congress while 38% favor them. But just 18% of Americans would prefer Congress pass nothing and leave the current system as it is.\nIt is in this context that attitudes toward Washington are best understood. When asked for a single word that best describes their impression of Congress, \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cself-serving\u201d and \u201cinept\u201d are volunteered most frequently. Of people offering a one-word description, 86% have something negative to say, while only 4% say something positive.\nJust 12% believe that Republicans and Democrats are working together in dealing with important issues facing the country \u2013 81% don\u2019t think so. While more blame Republican leaders than Democratic leaders for this (by 25% to 18%), fully 27% volunteer that both are to blame. And when asked which party has higher moral and ethical standards, neither party has an advantage \u2013 31% name the Democratic Party, 29% name the GOP, while 22% volunteer neither.\nThe sour public mood and disillusionment with Washington is apparent in Barack Obama\u2019s job approval ratings as well. For the first time in Pew Research Center survey, nearly as many say they disapprove (43%) of Obama\u2019s job performance as approve (46%). Even so, Obama\u2019s approval rating is well above the 31% who say they approve of the job the Democratic congressional leaders are doing and the 25% who give positive job ratings to GOP leaders.\nAfghanistan Opinions More Positive\nObama\u2019s ratings for dealing with specific issues are for the most part a little lower than his overall rating, which is typically the case for presidents. Roughly four-in-ten approve of the way Obama is handling foreign policy (42%), the economy (41%) and health care (39%).\nAn exception to this pattern is the public\u2019s view of his handling of the situation in Afghanistan. In the new survey, more approve (51%) than disapprove (35%) of Obama\u2019s job performance on Afghanistan; opinion was evenly divided in December 2009, while in November more disapproved than approved. Independents (51% approve) and Republicans (42%) give Obama much higher ratings on Afghanistan than other issues.\nRepublicans also are more likely than Democrats to think that things are going well in Afghanistan (61% vs. 52%). But perceptions of the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan have improved overall since November. In addition, a clear majority of the public (59%) continues to say that the United States will definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals there.\nPersonal Views of Obama\nWhile the public is divided over Obama\u2019s job performance, many Americans continue to express positive personal opinions of him. Majorities see Obama as inspiring (61%) and decisive (57%), and relatively few regard him as arrogant (35%) or detached (35%). Many also say that Obama makes them feel hopeful (54%) and proud (49%). Just 30% say that Obama makes them angry, while somewhat more (44%) say he makes them feel disappointed.\nObama\u2019s personal ratings are less positive than they were just after his election in November 2008. The changes in opinion of him have occurred across the political spectrum. But far fewer conservative Republicans say Obama is inspiring (61% to 25%) and far more say he makes them angry (18% to 62%). There also have been substantial changes in the views of independents: In November 2008, 68% said Obama made them feel hopeful; 48% say that today. Democrats are somewhat less positive about Obama than they were just after the election, but relatively small percentages see him as arrogant, detached or disappointing.\nThe survey finds that since the start of the year, most of the slippage in Obama\u2019s job approval rating has come among Democrats \u2013 particularly Democrats with lower incomes. Currently, 74% of Democrats approve of the way Obama is handling his job as president, down from 84% in January. Obama\u2019s approval rating is down 17 points over this period among Democrats with family incomes of less than $50,000 (from 83% to 66%), but is largely unchanged among those with incomes of $50,000 or more (89% to 84%).\nMost Health Care Opponents Want New Bill\nOpinion about the health care bills being discussed in Congress continues to be deeply split along partisan lines. Fully 81% of Republicans generally oppose the current bills while 62% of Democrats generally favor them. Far more independents still oppose (56%) than favor (32%) the health care bills.\nWhile the current bills draw more opposition than support, opponents generally prefer that Congress begin working on a new bill (28% of the public) rather than pass nothing and leave the health care system as it is (18%).\nNotably, 71% of the bills\u2019 opponents say they expect their own health care costs will go up in coming years if the legislation is enacted \u2013 but 62% predict their costs will rise if no changes are made to the health care system. Among the supporters of the current bills, far more say their future costs will increase if nothing is done on health care (67%) than if the legislation passes (27%).\nJob Problems Cut a Wide Swath\nThe number of Americans reporting that they or someone in their household has been without a job and looking for work in the past year has risen sharply; currently 54% say that, compared with 42% last October and 39% in February 2009.\nPeople are experiencing other job and financial stresses at similar or slightly higher levels than in February 2009. Roughly one-in-five (21%) say they have lost their job or been laid off, while 15% say they have had their hours reduced or taken a pay cut.\nAside from job-related issues, about a quarter (26%) say they had trouble getting or paying for medical care for themselves or their family, while 24% say they have had problems making their rent or mortgage payment. Overall, 70% of Americans say they have faced one or more job or financial-related problems in the past year, up from 59% in February 2009.\nMoreover, these concerns show no sign of easing in the future: 25% of those who are currently employed say it is very or somewhat likely they may be asked to take a cut in pay, 24% say it as least somewhat likely they may be laid off. Comparable proportions say it is very or somewhat likely their health care benefits (23%) or retirement benefits (22%) will be reduced or eliminated by their employer. These levels of concern are similar to February 2009.\n}}

The incoming Congress remains disproportionately white, male and Christian \u2015 much more so than the general American public.\nAccording to a new analysis by Pew Research Center, nearly 91 percent of the 115th Congress is Christian.

He also fought on the front lines of the war against illegal aliens entering the United States and sued Barack Obama over the issue.\nNow he wants to take his no-nonsense approach to government to Washington to help President Trump.\nSheriff Joe Arpaio, an octogenarian who has stated repeatedly that he\u2019s not done being a public servant, announced Tuesday he\u2019s seeking to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz..\n\u201cMoments ago, I filed the paperwork to run for United States Senate in Arizona to fill the seat that Jeff Flake is leaving behind,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThis is NOT going to be easy, and I pray to have your continued support today on DAY ONE of my campaign.\u201d\nHe described himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d while on duty in Arizona.\nArpaio was Maricopa County\u2019s elected sheriff from 1993 to 2016, and was voted out only after his enforcement of federal immigration laws earned him the opposition of both the Obama administration and a federal judge who said he had engaged in profiling and mistreating prisoners.\nWhat really goes on with the federal government? Read Andrew Napolitano\u2019s warning that \u201cIt is Dangerous to be Right when the Government is Wrong.\u201d\nPresident Trump immediately granted him a pardon for the conviction, but the publicity cost him the most recent election for sheriff.\nArpaio recently told the Washington Examiner: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to work hard; you don\u2019t take anything for granted. But I would not [be] doing this if I thought that I could not win. I\u2019m not here to get my name in the paper, I get that every day, anyway.\u201d\nArizona state Sen. Kelli Ward already is seeking the GOP nomination to replace Flake.\nArpaio said in his announcement: \u201cI have thought long and hard about this decision. And I did not make it without many discussions with my wonderful wife of over sixty years, Ava. And Ava agrees with me. We cannot sit idly by while our nation faces unprecedented challenges. President Trump needs my help in the Senate. He needs a conservative vote he can count on, and a voice in the Senate who knows first hand the threats our nation is dealing with.\u201d\nHe explained: \u201cAs the sheriff of America\u2019s fourth-most populous county for two decades, I witnessed every day the danger our streets and neighborhoods are facing. As sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, my deputies and I locked up violent drug dealers, callous human traffickers, and thousands of criminal gang members that were in this country illegally.\n\u201cFriend, with many of President Obama\u2019s failed and dangerous policies still in place, our nation is not safe \u2013 at least not yet. President Trump is working around the clock to make America great again, but he can\u2019t do this alone \u2013 he needs our conservative voice and my vote in Washington.\u201d\nHe cited existing problems:\n\u201cSanctuary cities like San Francisco are literally refusing to hold illegal immigrants accountable for their actions, just to further their politically correct, pro-amnesty agenda.\n\u201cThe once bedrock American commitment to paying our bills has been replaced by over $20 trillion in national debt.\n\u201cThe liberal Left attacks the rights of law abiding gun owners \u2013 but doesn\u2019t even bat an eye while so-called \u2018doctors\u2019 slaughter millions of unborn children in their mother\u2019s womb every single year.\n\u201cMillionaire athletes are lionized by the fake news media as \u2018heroes\u2019 for disrespecting the American flag and refusing to stand for our national anthem.\u201d\n\u201cEnough is enough. I\u2019m running for Senate because I want America to be great again. I know this isn\u2019t going to be easy. I know I\u2019ll be attacked by the far left, the establishment right and of course, the liberal media. The media is going to say every nasty thing they can think of and try to break me. But, friend, I have never been one to shy away from a fight \u2013 and I can\u2019t in good conscience sit back in retirement knowing that my grandchildren will inherit a country worse off than the America I\u2019ve spent my entire life defending.\u201d\nOpponents even went to court after Trump\u2019s pardon of Arpaio, demanding that it be reversed, but the move ultimately failed.\nHis conviction of contempt of court was delivered by a judge who said he went too far trying to protect Americans from illegal aliens.\nTrump noted that Arpaio\u2019s career started when he was 18 and enlisted in the military to go to Korea.\n\u201cAfter serving in the Army, Arpaio became a police officer in Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas, Nev., and later served as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), formerly the Bureau of Narcotics. After 25 years of admirable service, Arpaio went on to lead the DEA\u2019s branch in Arizona,\u201d the White House said.\nArpaio had been at odds with the Obama administration since its beginning, mostly over illegal immigration. The sheriff sued because of the impact illegal aliens have on the safety and security of his county\u2019s residents. Federal officials, in turn, have accused him of not treating illegals properly.\nA split panel of federal judges said Arpaio didn\u2019t have standing to sue, with the minority expressing outrage that the concerns of the sheriff of one of the nation\u2019s largest counties would be dismissed.\nHis unusual approach to law enforcement has earned him repeated election victories.\nFor example, he established chain gangs for inmates to contribute thousands of dollars of free labor to communities, painting over graffiti and cleaning streets.\nHe banned smoking, coffee, movies, pornographic magazines and unrestricted TV in jails. His costs per meal for inmates ran between 15 cents and 40 cents. He provided pink underwear for inmates to wear, after learning that inmates were stealing white jailhouse boxers.\nHe also posted mugshots online to serve as a deterrent, and he was behind the only official law-enforcement investigation of Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate. His investigators concluded that the birth certificate Obama presented at the White House as an official government document almost certainly is a forgery.\n}}

{{The American Medical Association, the nation\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 group, opposes the Senate health care bill, the organization announced in a letter to Senate leaders Monday.\n\u201cMedicine has long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or \u2018first, do no harm.\u2019 The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels,\u201d American Medical Association CEO James Madara wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\nThe American Medical Association is the latest health care sector group to express opposition to, or at least serious concerns with, the Senate bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. McConnell unveiled the bill Thursday and aims to bring it to the Senate floor for a final vote as soon as this week. With 52 Republicans in the Senate, McConnell can only lose two GOP votes if he wants to get the 50 needed to advance the bill. Five Republican senators, however, are already on record against it.\nThe physicians\u2019 lobbying organization cites numerous problems with the Senate GOP bill, starting with its likely effect of causing many millions of currently insured Americans to lose their health coverage and be unable to afford medical treatments.\n\u201cIt seems highly likely that a combination of smaller subsidies resulting from lower benchmarks and the increased likelihood of waivers of important protections such as required benefits, actuarial value standards, and out of pocket spending limits will expose low and middle income patients to higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care,\u201d the AMA\u2019s letter says.\nThe group also takes issue with the legislation\u2019s deep cuts to federal Medicaid spending.\n\u201cThe Senate proposal to artificially limit the growth of Medicaid expenditures below even the rate of medical inflation threatens to limit states\u2019 ability to address the health care needs of their most vulnerable citizens,\u201d the letter says.\nThe legislation would make tax credits for private health insurance created by the Affordable Care Act available to fewer people, reduce their value and tie them to plans that have larger deductibles and higher out-of-pocket costs than the policies sold under Affordable Care Act rules.\nThe bill also would permit states to make sweeping changes to insurance market rules, which would allow insurers to offer very skimpy plans that don\u2019t come with a basic set of guaranteed benefits and that could exclude treatments and medicines for people with high-cost ailments.\nAlthough insurers would still be forbidden to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them higher rates \u2015 as is the case under the Affordable Care Act \u2015 relaxing the benefit rules and introducing plans that require patients to pay more out-of-pocket would make the coverage less valuable, especially to people with pre-existing conditions.\nThe Senate bill would undo the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and end the current open-ended federal commitment to pay more than half the expense of covering any eligible Medicaid enrollee. Instead, federal Medicaid funding would be capped at a flat amount per person or a flat amount per state, based on a state\u2019s preference, that would grow more slowly than current Medicaid spending and more slowly than rising health care costs overall.\n\u201cWe sincerely hope that the Senate will take this opportunity to change the course of the current debate and work to fix problems with the current system. We believe that Congress should be working to increase the number of Americans with access to quality, affordable health insurance instead of pursuing policies that have the opposite effect, and we renew our commitment to work with you in that endeavor,\u201d the AMA\u2019s letter concludes.\nAlso on Monday, the National Association of Medicaid Directors, which represents the state officials who oversee the program, rejected the Medicaid components of the Senate bill.\nThe legislation would give states greater leeway to decide who is eligible for Medicaid and what benefits the program must cover, but these regulators argue that flexibility doesn\u2019t make up for the much lower funding amounts. Several governors have expressed similar concerns.\n\u201cNo amount of administrative or regulatory flexibility can compensate for the federal spending reductions that would occur as a result of this bill,\u201d the Medicaid officials said in a statement.\n\u201cChanges in the federal responsibility for financing the program must be accompanied by clearly articulated statutory changes to Medicaid to enable states to operate effectively under a cap,\u201d they went on. \u201cThe Senate bill does not accomplish that. It would be a transfer of risk, responsibility, and cost to the states of historic proportions.\u201d\nThe National Governors Association, which represents state chief executives from both parties, also weighed in on the Senate bill Monday, urging McConnell to slow down.\n\u201cGovernors must be given adequate time to determine the impact any health care bill will have on their states and residents, and ensure that the bill does not adversely harm the people we were elected to serve,\u201d Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) wrote to McConnell on behalf of all 50 governors. \u201cWe urge you to give states sufficient time to review the legislation before proceeding, so that the full impact of the legislation may be understood and explained to the American people.\u201d\nNumerous other health care groups also have misgivings or are outright opposed to passage of the Senate health care bill.

{{WASHINGTON (AFP, REUTERS) \u2013 France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron urged the United States to embrace multilateralism and warned of the perils of trade war and \u201cextreme nationalism\u201d in an address to Congress pushing back against Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\nThe French leader\u2019s feisty speech to lawmakers was a dramatic twist near the end of a three-day visit that had showcased his warm personal relationship with Trump, despite the gulf between their visions of world affairs.\nThe two presidents had literally embraced each other, repeatedly talking up their much-vaunted friendship during the trip, but in his speech to Congress Macron rigorously pushed back against Trump\u2019s trade, climate and non-proliferation policies.\n\u201cWe can build the 21st century world order based on a new breed of multilateralism, based on a more effective, accountable, and result-oriented multilateralism,\u201d Macron said, defending the rules-based world order.\nTrump has threatened to tear up international trade deals, scorns the United Nations, accuses US allies of not pulling their weight, walked away from the Paris climate accord and hates dealing with transnational bodies like the European Union.\nBut Macron, who one day earlier had appeared hand-in-hand with Trump at the White House, received applause from the US leader\u2019s domestic Democratic opponents by calling for a \u201cstrong multilateralism\u201d and avoiding an isolationist approach akin to \u201cclosing the door to the world.\u201d\nHe declared that France would not pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, warned against imposing trade tariffs on allies and stressed that global action on climate change is vital because there is \u201cno Planet B.\u201d\nCongress cracks up over Macron's Trump kiss reminder\nPRESERVE MULTILATERALISM\n\u201cThe United States is the one who invented this multilateralism. You\u2019re the ones now who have to help to preserve and reinvent it,\u201d he said, in a tacit nod to Trump\u2019s efforts to shake off international shackles.\nIn doing so, he flipped the script of the trip \u2013 the Trump White House\u2019s first full state visit \u2013 which was until now dominated by intimate images of the French and US first couples planting trees, exchanging kisses and socialising.\nTrump at one point brushed Macron\u2019s shoulder and said: \u201cHe is perfect.\u201d\nTransatlantic political reality reasserted itself on Wednesday (April 25), however, as Macron \u2013 speaking in an accented but increasingly confident English \u2013 recalled the glories of past US-French cooperation.\nTrump\u2019s trade sanctions against European steel and aluminum will enter into force in the coming weeks unless Trump agrees to sign a waiver.\nDespite his affection for Macron, he has not yet said he will do so. Macron hit back.\n\u201cWe need a free and fair trade, for sure,\u201d Macron said. \u201cA commercial war opposing allies is not consistent with our mission, with our history, with our current commitments for global security.\u201d\nTrump has also warned he may not renew sanctions waivers on Iran next month, which would effectively torpedo the 2015 nuclear deal, a triumph of multilateral diplomacy.\nMacron has more sympathy than perhaps any other foreign leader for Trump\u2019s arguments that the deal falls short of sealing off Iran\u2019s alleged quest for a nuclear weapon \u2013 which the French leader vowed before lawmakers that Teheran would not be allowed to possess.\n\u201cNot now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Never,\u201d he said.\nTogether with Trump, Macron called Tuesday for a \u201cnew\u201d deal with Teheran, but made clear to lawmakers that France would not be walking away from the existing accord.\n\u201cIt is true to say that this agreement may not help all concerns, and very important concerns,\u201d he told the lawmakers. \u201cBut we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my position,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why France will not leave the JCPOA, because we signed it.\u201d .\n\u2018UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS\u2019\nTrump had tweeted earlier on Wednesday that he was, \u201cLooking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honour and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT!\u201d\nThere was no immediate reaction from the White House afterward to Macron\u2019s speech.\nSeveral Democrats said they were impressed by Macron\u2019s impassioned call for US engagement on multiple fronts, particularly on climate change and Iran.\nHouse Democrat Adam Schiff judged that Macron had offered \u201cmore of a direct contradiction of the president than I was expecting.\u201d \u201cThere were more than a few uncomfortable moments on the GOP side of the aisle,\u201d he told AFP.\nMacron\u2019s words, often at odds with Trump policy, brought Democrats to their feet several times during the speech, with at least one lawmaker shouting \u201cVive la France!\u201d\nBut Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he didn\u2019t feel Macron had rebuked his host.\n\u201cHe said in there that he believes in free and fair trade. That\u2019s exactly what the president asked for,\u201d McCarthy said.\nMacron\u2019s provocative speech came after he enjoyed an exuberant welcome from the Republican president \u2013 an elaborate state dinner, an intimate get together for four with their wives at George Washington\u2019s Virginia estate Mount Vernon, and repeated vows of friendship.\nThe 40-year-old French leader spoke at length of \u201chow deep, how strong, and how intense the relationship is between our two countries,\u201d and marvelled at the unforeseen rapport he has forged with the 71-year-old Trump.\nBut while the \u201cbromance\u201d has provided plenty of material for late night TV comedy, the key question is whether Macron can translate the privileged relationship into concrete results \u2013 be it on trade, Iran or the climate.\nAfter his Congress speech, Macron addressed students at George Washington University, where he pledged to help \u201cwin peace\u201d in Syria by defeating Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremists in the war-scarred nation.\nHe also spoke of the \u201ctremendous challenge\u201d facing America\u2019s younger generation as it grapples with global issues like climate change and geo-politics, but offered words of encouragement.\n\u201cAt the end of the day you will be the one to decide,\u201d he said.\n}}
{{\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A powerful think tank chaired by former Sen. Sam Nunn and guided by trustees including Richard Armitage, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Harold Brown, William Cohen and Henry Kissinger, is in the final stages of preparing a report to the White House and U.S. Congress on the benefits of integrating the U.S., Mexico and Canada into one political, economic and security bloc.\nThe final report, published in English, Spanish and French, is scheduled for submission to all three governments by Sept. 30, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies.\nCSIS boasts of playing a large role in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 \u2013 a treaty that set in motion a political movement many believe resembles the early stages of the European Community on its way to becoming the European Union.\n\u201cThe results of the study will enable policymakers to make sound, strategic, long-range policy decisions about North America, with an emphasis on regional integration,\u201d explains Armand B. Peschard-Sverdrup, director of CSIS\u2019 Mexico Project. \u201cSpecifically, the project will focus on a detailed examination of future scenarios, which are based on current trends, and involve six areas of critical importance to the trilateral relationship: labor mobility, energy, the environment, security, competitiveness and border infrastructure and logistics.\u201d\nThe data collected for the report is based on seven secret roundtable sessions involving between 21 and 45 people and conducted by CSIS. The participants are politicians, business people, labor leaders and academics from all three countries with equal representation.\nAll of this is described in a CSIS report, \u201cNorth American Future 2025 Project.\u201d\n\u201cThe free flow of people across national borders will undoubtedly continue throughout the world as well as in North America, as will the social, political and economic challenges that accompany this trend,\u201d says the report. \u201cIn order to remain competitive in the global economy, it is imperative for the twenty-first century North American labor market to possess the flexibility necessary to meet industrial labor demands on a transitional basis and in a way that responds to market forces.\u201d\nAs WND reported last week, the controversial \u201cSecure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007,\u201d which would grant millions of illegal aliens the right to stay in the U.S. under certain conditions, contains provisions for the acceleration of the Security and Prosperity Partnership, a plan for North American economic and defense integration with remarkable similarities to the CSIS plan.\nThe bill, as worked out by Senate and White House negotiators, cites the SPP agreement signed by President Bush and his counterparts in Mexico and Canada March 23, 2005 \u2013 an agreement that has been criticized as a blueprint for building a European Union-style merger of the three countries of North America.\n\u201cIt is the sense of Congress that the United States and Mexico should accelerate the implementation of the Partnership for Prosperity to help generate economic growth and improve the standard of living in Mexico, which will lead to reduced migration,\u201d the draft legislation states on page 211 on the version time-stamped May 18, 2007 11:58 p.m.\nSince agreement on the major provisions of the bill was announced late last week, a firestorm of opposition has ignited across the country. Senators and representatives are reporting heavy volumes of phone calls and e-mails expressing outrage with the legislation they believe represents the largest \u201camnesty\u201d program ever contemplated by the federal government.\nMeanwhile, while many continue to express skepticism about a plot to integrate North America along the lines of the European Union, WND reported last week that 14 years ago, one of world\u2019s most celebrated economists and management experts said it was already on the fast track \u2013 and nothing could stop it.\nPeter F. Drucker, in one of his dozens of best-selling books, \u201cPost Capitalist Society,\u201d published in 1993, wrote that the European Community, the progenitor of the European Union, \u201ctriggered the attempt to create a North American economic community, built around the United States but integrating both Canada and Mexico into a common market.\u201d\n\u201cSo far this attempt is purely economic in its goal,\u201d wrote the Presidential Medal of Freedom honoree. \u201cBut it can hardly remain so in the long run.\u201d\nDrucker describes in his book the worldwide trends toward globalization that were evident back then \u2013 the creation and empowerment of transnational organizations and institutions, international environmental goals regarding carbon dioxide and agreements to fight terrorism long before 9/11.\nIf you would like to sound off on this issue, participate in today\u2019s WND Poll.\nGet Rep.

{{As gasoline prices have spiked above $3 a gallon throughout the country, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that the public\u2019s view of President Bush\u2019s job, the economy and the nation\u2019s direction have continued to decline. But with the midterm elections just six months away, the biggest drop in the survey \u2014 11 points in one month \u2014 is in the approval rating of Congress, which is locked in a bitter debate over what do about these gas prices, immigration, Iraq and a host of other issues.\n\u201cYou have never seen such a sour mood in the country,\u201d says Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican Bill McInturff. \u201cIt is sour, sour, sour.\u201d\nAnd in that sour mood, the poll shows, registered voters say they prefer Democrats controlling Congress \u2014 but by a smaller margin than in the past few NBC/Journal surveys.\nAccording to the poll, Bush\u2019s approval rating fell by one point from last month to 36 percent, his lowest mark in the survey. But the troubling news for Bush doesn\u2019t stop there: Hart explains that Bush has now spent nine consecutive months at 40 percent or below in the poll, a feat exceeded only by Richard Nixon (13 months) and Harry Truman (26 months).\nMcInturff adds that it will be difficult for the president to substantially improve his standing, barring an increase in stability in Iraq or some kind of \u201cextraordinary\u201d event taking place.\nYet Bush\u2019s approval isn\u2019t the only measure that has declined. In the poll \u2014 which was taken April 21-24 of 1,005 adults, and which has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points \u2014 just 24 percent believe the nation is headed in the right direction, a drop of two points since last month and seven points since January. What\u2019s more, only 17 percent think the nation\u2019s economy will improve in the next 12 months, a decline of seven points since March.\nWhy the growing pessimism? It appears that higher gas prices are partly to blame. A whopping 77 percent say they feel uneasy about the economy, due to rising gas prices, higher interest rates and a larger federal deficit. On the other hand, just 19 percent say they feel confident, because jobs are being created and the stock market is growing.\n\u201cGas prices and the deficit trump any other set of [economic] numbers,\u201d Hart says. \u201cIt just takes your breath away when you fill up for $50 or $60.\u201d\nIndeed, higher gas prices topped the list of events in the past six weeks that respondents say concern them the most. The possibility of Iran\u2019s building a nuclear weapon was next, followed by immigration and then the violence in Iraq.\nBut if the public is dissatisfied with gas prices, its opinion of Congress isn\u2019t much better. According to the poll, just 22 percent approve of the job Congress is doing, a drop of 11 points since March. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of movement in a four- to six-week period,\u201d says McInturff, the GOP pollster, who attributes the drop to a sharp decline in approval by Republican respondents.\nAsked to rank the top one or two reasons for their disapproval of Congress, 44 percent say they are tired of Democrats and Republicans fighting with each other, 36 percent say Congress doesn\u2019t seem to get that much done, and 34 percent say members are corrupt and unethical.\nHow will that anger play out in November\u2019s midterm elections? Forty-five percent of registered voters say they prefer Democrats controlling Congress, compared with 39 percent who say they want Republicans in charge. That six-point Democratic advantage, however, is smaller than the 13-point advantage Democrats held in March or the nine-point advantage they had in January.\nYet while McInturff says voters \u201care not happy with either party,\u201d he cautions against reading too much into that narrower margin, pointing out that all other polls he has seen show Democrats with a sizable lead.\nAlso in the NBC/Journal poll, 43 percent say their representative\u2019s position on national issues \u2014 a terrain that seems to favor Democrats \u2014 matters the most in deciding how they vote, while 38 percent maintain that what matters most is the representative\u2019s performance in taking care of problems in the district.\nAll of this, Hart says, adds up to a political environment that is \u201cexceptionally worrisome for Republicans.\u201d And he believes that as we head toward November, \u201cthe die is getting close to being cast\u201d \u2014 that Americans are unhappy and want change.\nMark Murray covers politics for NBC News.\n}}
{{The venerable General Social Survey results for 2014 confirm the findings from Gallup and other surveys that Americans have become significantly less confident in all branches of their government. This goes along with Gallup reports showing that Americans say dysfunctional government is the most important problem facing the United States.\nAs we would perhaps expect, given these dismal ratings, Americans' approval of the job being done by Congress is also low, at 18% for March. This is not the lowest in history; that honor goes to the 9% congressional job approval rating recorded in November 2013, after the federal government shutdown. But 18% is low by any standard, and this low level of approval has been consistent for years.\nOne interesting finding about approval of Congress at this juncture in history is the flat approval ratings we find among both Republicans and Democrats. In Gallup's March survey, only one percentage point separates the approval rating of Republicans/Republican leaners from that given by Democrats/Democratic leaners. The small group of Americans who are independents in the sense that they don't lean toward one party or the other give Congress both a lower approval and lower disapproval rating than others, mainly because almost one-quarter of this group are so detached from the system that they don't have an opinion about Congress at all.\nEverything else being equal, a reasonable expectation would be that, by this point, Republicans' approval of Congress would have risen significantly. Their party took over control of the Senate in the November 2014 elections, which gave Republicans control of both bodies of Congress for the first time since 2006. Nine years ago, back in March 2006 for example, when Republicans also controlled both houses of Congress, there was a 31-point spread between the rating given to Congress by Republicans (43%) and Democrats (16%). Similarly, by way of contrast, six years ago when Democrats were in control of both the Senate and the House in March 2009 -- Democrats' approval of the job Congress was doing was at 55%, compared with 21% among Republicans.\nEvery situation is different, and the partisan ratings for Congress in the month of March of various years reflect the history that leads up to that point, including what's happening in the presidency at that time, the overall approval of Congress and other factors. Plus, it may be that rank-and-file Republicans' views of Congress will improve in the weeks and months ahead. But, at this point, there is no sign of \"joy in Mudville\" among Republicans when we ask them to rate Congress, even though they now control it.\nSeveral issues are likely at play here. First, there are differences among subgroups of Republicans in congressional approval. Conservative Republicans tend to be more negative than are moderate/liberal Republicans. I combined February and March 2015 Gallup surveys to increase sample sizes, and found that 27% of moderate and liberal Republicans approved of the job Congress is doing, compared with 18% of conservative Republicans. This split isn't huge, but enough to suggest that Republicans' approval of Congress is, to some extent, being held back by the dissatisfaction of conservative Republicans -- most likely because they believe Congress is not being rigid enough in sticking to principle and refusing to compromise.\nSecond, it could be that the image of Congress has sunk so low in the eyes of Americans that it's moved beyond partisanship. In other words, even when a party controls Congress, the partisans of that party across the country have become so disillusioned that anything productive is going to be done that they can't bring themselves to say \"approve,\" even when their party is in charge. Third, it may be that having a Democratic president in office so taints Republicans' views of the whole federal government apparatus that they assume Congress isn't going to be able to get anything done, regardless of who's in charge.\n}}
{{Over the past few decades, as more women have joined the workforce, the American workplace has \u2014very slowly \u2014 begun to become more family friendly. More and more companies offer paid family leave, and many try to offset the costs of child care by offering reimbursements and on-site day care.\nBut the only institution constitutionally created to reflect our national values \u2014 Congress \u2014 is arguably the least family friendly institution in the country. The same people who set policy for millions of families in America serve in a job that literally splits families apart. If Congress had more family friendly rules, more women would run for office. And if more women were elected, our laws would be more conducive to the basic struggles most families face \u2014 housing, education, health and transportation.\nMembers of Congress do not incur much sympathy these days, but the truth is they lead a lousy lifestyle. Lawmakers spend most of their weeks away from their families, working long hours; when they return home often after long commutes, they spend time with constituents.\nI\u2019ve seen this up close. I am the daughter of two former members of Congress and have worked as a staff member in the Senate and White House. Even though I was in my 20s when both my parents were elected, I\u2019ve seen how stressful the life of a lawmaker can be for them and their families. That\u2019s why, when I considered running for office myself a few years ago, I decided the trade-off between being an active parent and representing my community in Congress wasn\u2019t worth it.\nTwo recent events threw a spotlight on the issue of how Congress treats families: Tammy Duckworth became the first U.S. senator in office to give birth, while Speaker Paul Ryan announced he\u2019ll give up his post because he\u2019s tired of being \u201ca weekend dad.\u201d As convenient as Ryan\u2019s decision may be, he nevertheless gave voice to the Faustian bargain of missing out on parenthood for the honor of serving in Congress. As inconvenient \u2014 but wonderful and brave \u2014 as Duckworth\u2019s choice is likely to be, she will face real challenges. Congress, is notoriously slow to modernize its internal practices: It has yet to have an official family leave policy and it wasn\u2019t until 2011 that female members had their own restroom off the floor of the House.\nBeing a member of Congress may seem like a glamorous job. Congress spends roughly 145 days a year in session; it\u2019s not uncommon for lawmakers to leave for the weekend on Thursday afternoon. But that schedule masks the real burdens of the job. The travel is brutal, and the schedule keeps member of Congress away from family a majority of days during each week for most of the year. For those with young families, that means forever forgoing many of fleeting joys of being present as your child learns to talk, read, swim, build Legos and paper airplanes; the chance to attend not just soccer games but also practices; and hilarious bedtime conversations about the speed of cheetahs, budding friendships at school and poignantly innocent moral questions.\nAs former Vice President Joe Biden said in explaining his daily rail commutes home to Delaware from D.C, \u201cI came to realize that a child can hold an important thought, something they want to say to their mom and dad, maybe 12 or 14 hours, and then it\u2019s gone. And when it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\nThe punishment Congress inflicts on families largely explains why it remains an overwhelmingly male institution. Only 20 percent of members are women. (Yes, it is 2018.) And it\u2019s an institution built for those for whom raising children is no longer a reality, if it ever was: Currently, the average age in the House is 57.8 and in the Senate it\u2019s 61.8.\nResearch by American University professor Jennifer Lawless helps demonstrate that men still rule in national public office. She reports that 90 nations now surpass the U.S. in the percentage of women in the national legislature. Of the 83 members elected for the first time to Congress in 2014, 64 are male and 19 are female. According to Lawless, half of those men, and only one woman, had children still at home \u2013 the rest either went for the job because they don\u2019t have children or their offspring are grown.\nOn average, women enter politics at any level four years later than men do, according to Rutgers University Center for Women in Politics, at the age of 51 versus 47. The research at Rutgers also found that female state legislators are significantly more likely than their male colleagues to say that their decision to run for office was influenced by their children being \u201cold enough.\u201d If women do pursue an office, it is more likely at the local level in jobs that don\u2019t require travel. Men are about twice as likely to express interest in a federal position. I\u2019m living proof of that: Instead of seeking a House seat, I ran and now serve on the school board.\nWaiting until child rearing is behind them is a familiar path taken by most national female leaders, notably by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the mother of five. My siblings and I were already adults when our mom took office in 1998.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The Constitution does not dictate the voting schedule of the House or the Senate. That\u2019s the job of the speaker and majority leader, respectively. There\u2019s no reason Congress can\u2019t adopt innovative new policies that utilize technology the way other sectors have. This could include, on occasion, absentee voting in support of the family cohesiveness of its members. Rather than voting three days a week, lawmakers could vote just as often \u2014 if not more \u2014with flexible time that allows for more time in the home district, serving both constituents and family.\nJust this week, the Senate took a small step toward adopting more family friendly rules when it voted to allow senators to bring a baby under the age of 1 onto the floor, a request from Duckworth who said that it would be difficult to vote without such a change. It passed unanimously, despite some grumbling from older lawmakers.\nThere has been a lot of talk recently about the historic number of women running for office, from school board to Congress. That\u2019s all good news. But it doesn\u2019t solve the structural issue that Congress remains unfriendly to families, even as much of the workplace increasingly adopts policies to foster work-life balance. If serving in D.C. were not such an awful option for parents of young kids, perhaps even more women would run for federal office. And more women in office would encourage Congress to adopt policies more in sync with the challenges facing American families.\nLaura Capps is a Member of the Board of the Santa Barbara Unified School District and a member of NewDeal, a national network of rising star state and local leaders. Her parents, Walter and Lois Capps, served in Congress from 1997-2017, consecutively.\n}}

{{Texas Democrats filed another redistricting lawsuit Friday, claiming the Republican-backed congressional redistricting map violates the Voting Rights Act by denying minority voters a fair share of the state\u2019s new congressional representation.\nBrought by state Rep.

Another redistricting lawsuit has been filed in Austin.\nMinorities accounted for almost all of the state\u2019s population growth over the past 10 years, which resulted in Texas gaining four new seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nOnly one of those new seats was designed to be a majority minority district, the other three seats were will represent new districts that are predominately conservative and Anglo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just offensive to see the people responsible for the population growth be denied representation,\u201d said Ed Martin, former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, who consults on redistricting matters.\nA variety of liberal and conservative interest groups have filed other lawsuits against the Congressional redistricting map, which was passed by the Legislature but has not been signed by Gov.

Torres Small is a granddaughter of Mexican immigrants.\nRegardless of who wins, the state's House delegation will be all people of color.\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who is Hispanic, won a sixth term representing northern New Mexico's 3rd District. He defeated Republican Jerald Steve McFall and Libertarian Chris Manning.\nLujan campaigned on efforts to advance immigration reform, expand Medicaid and address climate change.

{{U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Moline, had family and friends supporting her at the Congressional softball game Tuesday. | via Twitter, @CheriBustos\nRepublicans, Democrats and members of the media posed for pictures together, laughing and telling stories to one another as a packed crowd Tuesday night looked on in excitement. It wasn\u2019t a utopian fantasy or a clip from \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d but the scene of the 9th annual Congressional Women\u2019s Softball Game in Washington, D.C.\nOPINION\nThe game, which raises money for the Young Survival Coalition to benefit women with breast cancer, serves as a way to build relationships between the two major political parties and the media that covers them, according to game founder Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\u201cWe thought it would be beneficial and send a strong message if Republican and Democratic women played together against a common enemy: the press corps,\u201d Wasserman Schultz joked.\nThe Democratic congresswoman from Florida is a breast cancer survivor herself, and joined forces with three other congresswomen to start the game as a complement to the men\u2019s congressional matchup played at Nationals Park. But instead of pitting Democrats and Republicans against each other on the diamond, the women\u2019s game, at Watkins Recreational Center, combines both members of Congress for a bicameral team against the press.\n\u201cWe live in polarizing times, but even in the years when it was less polarized when we first started the game, we were committed and thought it was important to play together on a team, because there were real opportunities to get to know one another as women, as friends, set politics aside, and really fight together for a cause that matters to us all,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told RealClearSports.\nThe press narrowly beat Congress, 2-1, but the important number was the $292,097.59 the game raised for Young Survivors Coalition. That puts the total amount of money raised for breast cancer at more than $1.1 million since the game began in 2009.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been about the community and sisterhood that this game offers,\u201d press team captain and New York Times journalist Mikayla Bouchard told RealClearSports. \u201cIt is an immediate network of women who just want to support each other and have a good time. Obviously there\u2019s competition, but it brings out the best, I think, in Washington.\u201d\nThe matchup showcased the working relationship between Congress and the press in a sports environment that allows oftentimes clashing factions to come together in a show of solidarity.\n\u201cIf you can bring people of different parties, maybe of adversarial jobs like press members, into a common hobby, something with a common goal and objective that everyone is working toward, that alone puts everyone on the same page,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cIs sports the only thing? I don\u2019t think so, but it does offer that ability.\u201d\nWith softball as a backdrop for coming together and raising money and awareness for a charitable cause, the Congressional Women\u2019s Softball Game highlights the best in sports.\n\u201cSports is the connective tissue that I think Americans use to bridge differences, to allow us to rise above everyday life, to engage in spirited competition, to learn how to be good sports, and to come together as a team,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s amazing about team sports. When we go on and off that field as a team of bipartisan members of Congress, we don\u2019t just leave that notion of team on the field when the game is over.\u201d\nCory Gunkel writes for Real Clear Sports, where this was posted.\n}}
{{Democratic and Republican lawmakers can hardly agree on anything that nothing ever gets done in Washington. Last Thursday, however, members of Congress from both Houses announced the introduction of a bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to 260,000 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers who responded to President Roosevelt's call-to-duty and fought under the American flag in World War II. Led by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), other leading cosponsors were on hand to commend the bravery of Filipino veterans, including Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV), Rep. Juan Vargas (D-CA), and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).\n\"These soldiers did not only defend the nation but they also defended and ultimately liberated sovereign territories held by the U.S. government. These loyal and valiant men and women fought, suffered, and in many instances died in the same manner and under the same commander as other members of our United States Armed Forces during World War II,\" said Congresswoman Gabbard. Sen. Hirono added, \"If there were ever veterans who deserved the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, it is our Filipino veterans and brothers in arms.\"\nFilipino WWII veterans were on hand, along with Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Tony Taguba, who leads the Filipino Veterans Recognition and Education Project, a non-partisan, community-based group raising awareness of the service rendered by Filipino and Filipino-American troops during the Second World War.\n\"For over 70 years, the Filipino WWII Soldiers have sought recognition for their courageous actions and selfless service in defending the United States and Philippines,\" said Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Tony Taguba. \"Despite having their benefits rescinded by the US Congress in 1946, they maintained their unwavering loyalty to the U.S. We are eternally grateful for their faithful and dedicated service. They have earned national recognition from the US Congress proven by the thousands of lives lost in combat, and for those wounded for life. We ask Congress to approve the Congressional Gold Medal for the Filipino WWII Soldiers.\"\nOn July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a military order directing the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Scouts, and Philippine Constabulary to be under the command of the U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) commander to defend the Philippines and United States. A year later, the fall of Bataan (April 1942) and Corregidor (May 1942) led to the capture of over 72,000 American and Filipino troops. The soldiers of Bataan went through the Bataan Death March, while the soldiers of Corregidor were taken to Manila before being transported to Camp O'Donnell. Remnants of the USAFFE forces and Filipino civilians organized into recognized guerilla units led by U.S. and Philippine Army Officers. In 1945, the 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments and 1st Recon Battalion joined the fight.\nOver 260,000 Filipino troops fought in the Second World War. An estimated 16,000 to 17,000 soldiers remain in the U.S. and Philippines. However, public awareness about the contributions of Filipino soldiers during WWII is scant or nonexistent. While other minority veterans groups, namely, the Tuskegee Airmen (2006), Navajo Code Talkers (2008), Women Air Force Service Pilots (2009), Japanese American Nisei Soldiers (2010), Montfort Point Marines (2011), and Puerto Rican Soldiers (2014) have been formally recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal, Filipino American WWII soldiers have not been similarly honored for their selfless sacrifice and dedicated service.\n\"I heard the passion that they felt for America and the American cause in the war in their aging voices,\" said Rep. Heck, who has championed the recognition and compensation of Filipino-American WW II veterans. \"And it is only fitting and proper that we acknowledge their great sacrifice in service to the United States with the Congressional Gold Medal.\"\n}}

{{Bill sets aside more than 1m acres of new wilderness and conservation areas including rivers in California and Utah\nJoshua Tree and Death Valley national parks are to be enlarged, and stunning river landscapes in California and Utah will be protected, under new legislation that passed the US Senate on Tuesday.\nIn all the public lands package sets aside more than a million acres of new wilderness and conservation areas in western states.\nThe Natural Resources Management Act passed 92-8 in the Republican-controlled Senate, a notable bipartisan effort in an administration marked by conservation rollbacks. Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has shrunk national monuments and put large swaths of land up for oil, gas and mining leases, including on the doorsteps of national monuments, parks and wilderness areas. The bill will go to the Democrat-controlled House next, where it\u2019s likely to pass, and then to the president\u2019s desk.\nThe new legislation designates 375,500 acres of new wilderness in the southern California desert. Photograph: Bob Wick/Bureau of Land Management\nThe landmark bill protects nearly 500,000 acres in California alone, including adding 43,000 acres to Death Valley national park and Joshua Tree national park, which was damaged by unsupervised crowds during the recent government shutdown. The bill also designates 375,500 acres of new wilderness in the southern California desert, which is a critical ecosystem for bighorn sheep and desert tortoise and the setting for thousands of years of cultural history, including the Old Spanish Trail, a historic trade route that linked northern New Mexico to Los Angeles.\nThe shutdown is over. Can Joshua Tree recover?

Photograph: Bob Wick/Bureau of Land Management\nAs for watersheds, some 30,000 acres adjacent to the Yellowstone River in Montana will be protected from mining, and 100,000 acres of the Umpqua watershed in Oregon, one of the most important areas in the Pacific north-west for salmon and steelhead trout, will be conserved. The bill classifies nearly 620 miles of river as \u201cwild and scenic\u201d \u2013 prohibiting, for instance, federal support for dam construction \u2013 including the Amargosa River in California, the Green River in Utah and tributaries of the Rogue River in Oregon.\nNot least, it renews the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses income from offshore oil and gas leasing to safeguards natural areas.

{{It is fair to judge Liz Cheney based on the family brand? Personally, I try not to hold the illegal, immoral acts of a father against his son or daughter unless he or she implicates herself in the objectionable positions.\nLiz Cheney hasn't just embraced the objectionable actions and positions of neoconservative Republicans. She has also earned an independent reputation as someone who participates in weak, laughable, and even scurrilous attacks on ideological opponents that can only cast doubt on her judgment and moral character. The weak, laughable attacks are often aimed at Obama, of whom I am often critical. But even people who hold Obama in low esteem can't help but feel embarrassed on behalf of commentators who discredit themselves by making absurd claims like, \"He's unwilling to go after the terrorists that are threatening the nation.\" To deny Obama's willingness to go after terrorists is to be deeply ignorant, ideologically blinkered, or a liar. None of those qualities is desirable in an aspiring U.S. senator.\nOn another occasion, Cheney said of Obama, \"He's working to preemptively disarm America while rogue states like North Korea and Iran build nuclear weapons capabilities and stockpiles.\" Under Obama, the U.S. spends orders of magnitude more on defense than any other country; it maintains a nuclear stockpile large enough to obliterate whole continents if not the earth itself; and it has invested billions in a fleet of armed drones that increases our weapons capabilities. Obama's policy is, in other words, keeping us armed to the teeth. I understand that convention holds that it's unfair to begrudge pundits when they go on Fox News and utter inane talking points so far beyond exaggeration that they're just lies, but this is especially inane.\nCheney's low regard for civil liberties bothers me most. Others on the right are most bothered by her work for Keep America Safe. As the New York Times reported in a 2010 article about its efforts:\nA conservative advocacy organization in Washington, Keep America Safe, kicked up a storm last week when it released a video that questioned the loyalty of Justice Department lawyers who worked in the past on behalf of detained terrorism suspects. But beyond the expected liberal outrage, the tactics of the group, which is run by Liz Cheney, the daughter of the former vice president, have also split the tightly knit world of conservative legal scholars. Many conservatives, including members of the Federalist Society, the quarter-century-old policy group devoted to conservative and libertarian legal ideals, have vehemently criticized Ms. Cheney's video, and say it violates the American legal principle that even unpopular defendants deserve a lawyer. \"There's something truly bizarre about this,\" said Richard A. Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor and a revered figure among many members of the society. \"Liz Cheney is a former student of mine -- I don't know what moves her on this thing,\" he said. On Sunday, Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, issued a joint letter criticizing the \"shameful series of attacks\" on government lawyers, which it said were \"unjust to the individuals in question and destructive of any attempt to build lasting mechanisms for counterterrorism adjudications.\" The letter was signed by a Who's Who of former Republican administration officials and conservative legal figures, including Kenneth W. Starr, the former special prosecutor, and Charles D. Stimson, who resigned from the second Bush administration after suggesting that businesses might think twice before hiring law firms that had represented detainees. Other Bush administration figures who signed include Peter D. Keisler, a former acting attorney general, and Larry D. Thompson, a former deputy attorney general. The letter cited \"the American tradition of zealous representation of unpopular clients,\" including the defense by John Adams of British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre, and noted that some detainee advocates, who worked pro bono, have made arguments that swayed the Supreme Court. Ms. Cheney's video referred to the lawyers as the \"Al Qaeda Seven,\" and accused the Justice Department of concealing their names, which were later revealed by Fox News.\nTobin might have been less puzzled by the opposition to Cheney's candidacy if he'd recalled how many people lost respect for her enough to publicly declare her approach to advocacy \"shameful.\"\n}}
{{Early Arab American literary contributions are not mainstream. I am therefore, especially gratified to learn of a national effort to recognize one of our community's formidable figures.\nA Congressional initiative is shaping up to honor the life and legacy of Arab American Ameen Rihani. A recently introduced bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 608, by Representatives Charles Boustany (R-LA) and Nick Rahall (D-WV), celebrates Ameen Rihani's monumental contributions to Arab American literary accomplishments, recognizes the sentential anniversary of his first novel and above all memorializes his devotion to building a meaningful relationship between the Arab world and the United States.\nAmeen Rihani's (1876-1940) unmatched works and astute vision have left an irreplaceable\nmark on the development of the Arab American identity, the cultural and literary contributions to their enrichment of America's cultural landscape. In particular, Rihani's 1911 novel, The Book of Khalid, tells an extraordinary story of migration from Baalbek, Lebanon to the \"Washington Street\" neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, NYC.\nRihani's life story and literature offer us the ability to communicate our shared story to the American public with the same persistent spirit that Rihani used in dedicating his life to bridging nations, religions, and cultures.\nRihani became active in the New York avant-garde and the budding Arab American cultural scene, publishing newspaper articles, original and translated poetry, and essays in both English and Arabic. His own early verses were notable for their experimentation, and he introduced the concept of free verse to Arabic poetry. He published 29 volumes in English and 24 in Arabic. He earned his American citizenship in 1901.\nWe laude Representatives Rahall and Boustany for introducing this significant and most appropriate resolution. In this regard, we call on all members of Congress, especially our New Jersey delegation, to indicate their support for this resolution. We urge all our readers to contact their representatives and ask them to do the same.\nRecognizing Ameen Rihani during April, The National Arab Heritage Month, is most appropriate. This resolution offers a rare occasion to raise Rihani's cultural profile and further communicates his message of dialogue and unity between East and West. \"His body of work seems uncannily made for this moment in time, which has not lost its peril or urgent need for reconciliation.\nPresently, there is also a critical need to popularize, document, and to celebrate the impressive history and literary creations of the early Arab-American immigrants, whose struggles and creativity fit perfectly within the great American narrative of immigration,\" assimilation and of earning the right to be a proud American.\nAmeen Rihani's pioneering influence on the young Arab American immigrant community should not be understated; it should be celebrated and shared widely. Show your support of Ameen Rihani's legacy by buying a special reprinting of his book, the Book of Khalid, which is set for release on May 12, 2012.\nDr. Aref Assaf is president of American Arab Forum, www.aafusa.org\n}}

{{Aug. 17 --The odds might be against him, but don't tell Guy Furay he's running an uphill race.\nThe American Party candidate spoke with the Herald-Journal this week, just days after getting married in Las Vegas , and less than three months out from a race that will decide who will replace Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy to represent South Carolina's 4th Congressional District .\n\"I've got 82 days to meet and speak to as many people as I can,\" Furay said. \"Everyone of them is going to count.\"\nAs local Democrats and Republicans slogged through bitter primary battles earlier this year, Furay has been a ubiquitous presence at events hosted by both parties as he boned up on campaign issues and readied himself for this year's general election, where he'll square off against Democrat Brandon Brown and Republican William Timmons .\nWhat's the big idea?\nFuray said working more than two decades in the health insurance industry have convinced him that both the insurance and healthcare markets are broken.\nHe believes former President Barack Obama's signature legislature, the Affordable Care Act, fixed some portions of those systems and created problems in others.\n\"Now, families are paying more, in some instances, for their health insurance per month than they're paying on their mortgage,\" Furay said. \"And there's really not even a conversation about what should be done about it. That needs to change.\"\nIt's about showing up\nEven without a primary opponent this spring, Furay was out and about at multiple political events, like primary debates and policy speeches, across the Upstate.\n\"I would do that even if I wasn't a candidate,\" Furay said. \"But it's important to know how your opponents view particular circumstances. It helps you see distinctions between your views and theirs, and I'm going to have to draw a contrast between myself and the other candidates.\"\nFuray on tariffs and trade\n\"We learned in physics every action has an equal and opposite reaction,\" Furay said. \"Tariffs ultimately raise prices for consumers, because it's essentially a tax. And when we raise prices or tariffs, our trade partners respond by raising tariffs on things we sell like food, so while tariffs are one of those levers we can use, I'm not particularly a fan.\"\nWhy he thinks he can win\nConventional wisdom dictates political outsiders and third party candidates can't win. Furay said he believes Donald Trump -- who he said based his presidential run, in part, on the need for outsiders in Washington, D.C. -- at least amended some of those time worn rules.\n\"Conventional wisdom says a third party can't win,\" Furay said. \"But that's perpetuated by both Democrats and Republicans . Across the country, something like 44 percent of the country identifies as independent. This is a country built on the idea that anybody can become a leader. All you have to do is defeat the lie that the independent can't win.\"\nDon't sweat the campaign\nTo Furay, the campaign trail is a kind of extended job interview unfolding in the public eye.\n\"If you're applying for a job to be a representative, you've got to know who you are representing,\" Furay said. \"That's why going to things like debates, or speeches, for the other parties is important. You need to understand what's on the voter's mind, understand what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck.

{{Do we have a solid economic recovery underway?\nThe evidence will leave you whipsawed. Everywhere you turn, it seems, there is an economic contradiction. The experts \u2013 economists \u2013 fall back on the math of their profession. They have been shrugging that the data is \"noisy\", that there are flaws in the way the data is calculated. If pushed, they'll say it's a recovery, but a weak one.\nEven if you're not an economist, it's hard to know which indicators matter, and what they're telling us.\nHousing is up, but gross domestic product was sharply down in December, almost to recessionary territory. The economy has lost 3.2m jobs since 2007, but 5.2m have been created since 2009. Even so, the number of unemployed far outpaces the number of jobs. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities offered this chilling fact about the ratio of workers to job openings:\n\"In November 2012, 12 million workers were unemployed but there were only 3.7m job openings. That is about 10 unemployed workers for every three available positions \u2013 in other words, even if every available job were filled by an unemployed individual, about seven of every 10 unemployed workers would still be unemployed.\"\nThe jobless rate keeps dropping, but we have roughly the same ratio of employed-to-unemployed people that we had last year. The economy gained 181,000 jobs a month last year, but the percentage of people who have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks has stayed relatively steady.\nPeople are working more hours, but productivity is falling. And economic output has almost ground to a halt, growing by 0.1% in December.\nHouseholds are becoming less indebted, which is a welcome development, but that's mostly because they are defaulting on their debt. Disposable personal income is rising, tentatively, which should indicate at least a modest amount of economic advancement, but income segregation is also on the rise, which indicates that the middle class is shrinking and more economic inequality is taking root.\nIt doesn't really look like a weak, uneven recovery; it looks like a manic one. Instead of a good, square meal, we get table scraps. Fine. We'll still eat. But even those table scraps may run out soon.\nIn roughly three weeks, Congress has another chance to torpedo whatever modest economic progress we've made.\nTheir tool will be the sequester: the package of punitive budget cuts is designed to slash at least $85.3bn from the federal budget this year, and by around $1.2tn in a decade. The cuts will reduce the national deficit, but they worry those who believe that the economy is not strong enough yet to start slashing costs \u2013 which also means slashing government jobs. The CBO predicted this week that the sequester would go into effect as soon as 1 March.\nOne of the strange features of this recovery is that a lot of levers over economic growth are not in the hands of private companies; they are in the hands of Washington. The Congressional Budget Office, which is the non-partisan dungeon-master of all economic numbers, started its report this week with this heavy hint about Congress's power to boost or kill the recovery:\n\"Economic growth will remain slow this year, CBO anticipates, as gradual improvement in many of the forces that drive the economy is offset by the effects of budgetary changes that are scheduled to occur under current law.\"\nShakespeare it's not, but the message there is clear: the CBO believes that the economy is at the mercy of the sequester. Republicans will love the CBO's conclusion that budget cuts will reduce the deficit to less than $1tn for the first time in Obama's presidency. But it's hard to get excited about the CBO's other major conclusion: that the economy will grow at a sickly 1.4% this year.\nThese two things are related: big budget cuts will reduce economic growth. The CBO makes it clear that budget cuts now will hurt the economy, which is already weak.\nThis is not just an intellectual debate over numbers. Households will feel this, the fourth year of what is being called a recovery but still feels like a recession. The reduction of economic growth means it is will be harder, again, to have these things this year: better jobs, more valuable houses, better access to loans and growing personal income.\nThe sequester was never designed as a reality; it was created as a package of budget cuts that started as economic self-sabotage \u2013 the cuts would be so deep, so extreme, so that no reasonable lawmaker would ever let them pass. Yet, as the date of the sequester draws near, Congress still hasn't acted. In the worst case, this will be another pointless, failed negotiation that will go into the 11th hour and take the economy on a rollercoaster ride with it.\nThis again? It seems that at least one major indicator has not changed by much over the past few years: reasonable lawmakers are still in short supply.\n}}

He's just another person on the planet as far as I'm concerned,\" is how Perry explains it.\nPerry's mother Cecile, an airline flight attendant, made the decision to leave that marriage shortly after Scott's birth, leaving for South Central Pennsylvania on a job transfer that, her son said, was designed to get as far away as possible from the old life.\nPerry, 56, has revealed more about his background than ever before during this campaign, often opening debates and even running an advertisement with anecdotes about growing up in a home without electricity or indoor plumbing, and ate food that others were throwing out.\nBut it's a reluctant opening, his aides say, because Perry is not eager to shove his Mom and siblings into the public eye. Efforts to reach out to Perry's family were unsuccessful for this report, so there are some gaps.\nStill, the Congressman expounded on his back story a little more in an interview with the Patriot-News.\nThe Perry family, a single mom and her two kids, landed first in Harrisburg, on Berryhill Street.\nShortly thereafter, they moved to Chestnut Grove Road in Carroll Township, the home where Scott Perry grew up and - in this campaign - he has recalled a period of grinding poverty.\nHis mom eventually remarried to Daniel Chimel, a pilot and air traffic controller by profession. But the new relationship, in Perry's recollection, wasn't that much better than the one Cecile left in California.\nAs Scott Perry recalls it, Chimel, who died in 2015, had his own troubles keeping jobs.\n\"He was chronically unemployed, and my Mom worked a lot, so there was lot's of fighting over paying the bills and not working, and that kind of stuff,\" Perry recalled.\n\"We didn't have what I guess you would call a very caring family relationship.\"\nFor a period of several years, Perry has told campaign audiences, the family lived using a generator for power, taking their water from a pump, and making full use of an outhouse on the property.\nWhen his mother lost her airline job, she took work for a wholesale food company and brought home expired foods that could no longer be sold publically for her kids to eat.\nThings would improve over time: the home was wired and connected to the power grid; a well and septic tank were added to provide modern plumbing.\nBut Perry still remembers the teen envy he felt wearing his Sears Toughskin jeans to school at a time when it seemed like everybody else had Levi's.\nOr the humiliation of going to get a lunch token for the school meals - in kind of a forerunner of today's \"lunch-shaming.\"\nNobody ever directly mocked him for it, Perry said, but \"I just knew that I was the only kid that I knew among my friends who had to do that... and I wasn't proud how that was happening.\nWhat he remembers, more than anything, was feeling \"out of place... You're trying to fit in, but you don't fit in.\"\nPerry graduated from Northern High School and Cumberland-Perry Vocational / Technical School with an auto mechanics certification and was working at a local service station when a chance conversation with a girlfriend's Dad got him into the National Guard.\nThe relationship with the girl didn't last; the one with the Guard appears to have been transformative.\nPerry went off to study construction and design drafting for his occupational training, and started to grasp the idea that education could be his springboard rather than something to suffer through.\nWhile working a series of full-time jobs, he attended HACC and later Penn State Harrisburg, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in 1991.\nIt was during that time that Perry started his own mechanical contracting business, Hydrotech Mechanical Services, went to Officer Candidate School and became an officer in the Guard.\nHe also started to get involved in local politics.\nThat latter passion, he says, came to him as he was completing his bachelor's degree at Penn State.\nPerry was always interested in politics; he'd just always figured the doors to that kind of world were not open to people like him - people with dirt under their fingernails.\nAt the end of a political science class at Penn State, he asked his professor what he could do to become personally involved, and the prof put him in touch with the Republican State Committee.\nWorking under the mentorship of longtime York GOP Chairman John Thompson, he gravitated to the Young Republicans organization, eventually becoming state chair of that organization.\nIt hasn't always been a straight line up.\nIn a well-documented case from 2002, Perry pleaded guilty to making false reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection stemming from his firm's work monitoring a small private sewage treatment plant.\nPerry, who's said his only mistake was taking on a customer who was cheating and perhaps being slow to realize it, completed requirements to have his record expunged and moved on.\nBut wherever there have been setbacks, Perry, a married, father of two, has shown an amazing drive to persevere through and overcome them.\nIn his own first run for elective office, he fought through a crowded GOP primary to win his state House seat, and then a seven-candidate primary to get to Congress.\nIn the Guard, he deployed to Iraq in 2009, and has now attained the rank of brigadier general.\nThose who have known him the longest say they appreciate that for all that climbing, he still treats them pretty much like the mop-haired teen who pumped their gas at the former Ray's Exxon on Route 15.\n\"I think he's always been concerned about the people in his area,\" said Vickie Hardy, the daughter of that service station operator who fondly recalls Perry's impromptu eulogy at her Dad's funeral a few years ago.\n\"I don't think he sees himself as better than anyone else.\nPerry said his personal climb has left him a devout believer in the American Dream. And, at times, disappointed in how that's been translated for others.\nBoth sentiments inform his political world view.\n\"I got a hand-up, and we do help our neighbors,\" Perry said. \"But I also know that you can also do a lot of for yourself if you show up with a good attitude and work hard.\"\n}}
{{The heads of the bipartisan Congressional Israel Allies Caucus have strongly condemned an American organization of professors for their newly endorsed boycott of Israeli academic institutions, saying the move smacks of double standards.\nThe American Studies Association members voted last week in favor of an academic boycott of Israeli colleges and universities, in protest of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians. Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Ze'ev Elkin slammed the organization as a \"radical leftist group\", but expressed concern that the embargo could be adopted by other academic institutions.\nRelated stories:\n\"I am deeply disappointed with the decision by the American Studies Association to launch an academic boycott of Israel. I simply fail to see how cutting off ties to Israeli universities furthers the interests of peace and coexistence,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY).\n\"I would note that Israel is the first country to be boycotted by this academic organization, which has chosen to stay silent on the slaughter in Syria, the continued imprisonment of democracy activists in Iran or the scores of other dictatorships around the world. Yet once again we see this unfair double standards applied to Israel.\"\nMeanwhile, Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) said that the boycott was self-defeating, given Israel's superior academic record.\n\"It is deeply ironic that the American Studies Association has chosen to launch an academic boycott on Israel - the nation with the highest number of scientists, technicians, engineers and museums per capita in the entire world,\" he said.\n\"Israel's historic contributions to science, technology, music and scholarship, along with its academic and cultural exchange with American universities in general are unrivaled.\n\"The ASA claims to pride itself on its promotion of the study of American culture and history, but this decision shamefully contradicts their objectives in every capacity, especially in light of America's efforts to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\nRep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) branded the move \"deeply disturbing and conspicuously unjust\".\n\"This bigoted one-sided boycott is a shameful assault on academic freedom, demonizes Israel and does nothing to advance the cause of lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace,\" he said.\nDemocratic congressman Brad Sherman of California also weighed in, saying that the boycott did not help the quest for Middle East peace.\n\u201cI deeply oppose the American Studies Association\u2019s recent decision to endorse a boycott of Israeli universities,\" Sherman said.\n\"Israel is a vibrant democracy, with a strong commitment to the rule of law and religious freedom, and America\u2019s closest ally and friend in the Middle East. Despite immense challenges over the past several decades, the people of Israel have made profound contributions to academia.\n\"If the American Studies Association is interested in peace in the Middle East, then it should reverse course and instead expand engagement and dialogue with Israeli universities. The American Studies Association does not speak for American colleges or professors. Some 827 activists cast an anti-Israel vote.\u201d\u200e\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter\n}}

{{The words of the Declaration of Independence reach across time to speak to the hearts of Americans even after 242 years. Here's the entire declaration that led to America's freedom:\nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

{{President Barack Obama, one day after holding a very personal interview on Google+ Hangouts, has stayed true to his word and sent an official Startup America Legislative agenda to Congress to keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive in the US.\nAmong the items President Obama proposed as part of the program include tax breaks for small businesses as well as reform around allowing immigrants to stay in the US by handling the current backlog of visa requests.\nHere\u2019s what the President had to say about the dedication to startups in America:\nOne year ago today, I called for an all hands on deck effort to ensure that America remains the best place on Earth to turn a great idea into a successful business. The private sector responded, with the Startup America Partnership launching new entrepreneurial networks all across the country. Today, we\u2019re taking new steps that build on that progress, and I urge Congress to send me a common-sense bipartisan bill that does even more to expand access to capital and cut taxes for America\u2019s entrepreneurs and small businesses.\nAlong with cutting taxes for small businesses, the President is supporting new ways of funding for startups, such as \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d, and is calling for a national framework to be built to support the micro-donation avenue of funding.\nClearly the President has recognized that the United States is a leader in small businesses, and making it easier to start these companies in the US will not only keep the talent in the country, it will also attract talent and funding from outside of the country. During the State of the Union last week, Obama said that \u201cMost new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let\u2019s pass an agenda that helps them succeed.\u201d This appears to be exactly what he was referring to.\nIn addition to the agenda items sent to Congress, the President would like to see more involvement from schools and is introducing programs like the \u201cNational Education Startup Challenge\u201d, which invites those in 6th grade and all the way up to college to come up with solutions to solve education and non-profit issues the US is currently facing.\nSome may say that this is merely a part of Obama\u2019s plan to get re-elected but of all of the things that he could support, startups aren\u2019t the worst thing. Once Facebook goes public, many will be watching to see how the company does and it could set the tone for tech companies to come over the next twenty years.\nRead next: Social media matters more than ever in this US presidential election\n}}

{{I authored the following Op-Ed on CNN.com highlighting the critical need to pass the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act when the Senate votes later today:\nSenate must pass FISA Section 702 to protect Americans\nSen. John Cornyn\nCNN\nJanuary 18, 2018\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2018/01/18/opinions/fisa-is-needed-to-protect-america-opinion-cornyn/index.html\nFor Americans, September 11, 2001 will forever be etched into our memories. The world watched as an always resolute nation fell victim to a horrific act of terror on its own soil. Our enemies celebrated in a seemingly impervious nation being brought to its knees, if only for a moment.\nMore than 15 years later, America remains a beacon of hope in an increasingly dangerous world -- due, in large part, to those who combat terror, often away from the public eye and with little recognition. Congress is tasked with providing important tools the intelligence community needs to fight our enemies, which includes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law allows us to conduct surveillance on foreign agents and terrorists who are outside the United States so we can efficiently and effectively acquire critical information and stop the next attack before it happens.\nThe House of Representatives already acted earlier this month to reauthorize the law, and it's critical the Senate follow suit before the program expires Friday. This program is vital to our national security; without this tool, we are asking our intelligence community to do its job with one hand tied behind its back. However, some have spread misinformation about what this law does or does not do.\nCritics have claimed this law will trample on Fourth Amendment protections for Americans here at home. Because the law requires that targets of Section 702 must be foreign citizens outside the US, those targets are not covered by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. Courts have found the law to be constitutional.\nFurthermore, there are multiple safeguards built into the statute that prohibit the US government from intentionally targeting Americans. And there are also \"minimization\" procedures in place to protect the privacy of US citizens. Congressional committees such as the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee -- both of which I serve on -- conduct rigorous oversight of the program, as does the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nWhether it's combating terrorism, detecting and countering cyber-attacks, or protecting troops overseas from foreign threats, this legislation reauthorizes one of the crown jewels of foreign intelligence. And far from ignoring Americans' privacy concerns, the protections enshrined in the law embrace and defend them.\nThe stakes are high and the clock is ticking. The Senate will have a chance to act this week so the US government can continue to collect critical national security information to protect the American people. Handcuffing our intelligence community by letting the program lapse even one day could stop us from utilizing vital information to prevent terrorist attacks.\n}}
{{Just under a month ago, House Republican leaders put out a set of standards that laid out their principles for immigration reform, including, for the first time, an endorsement of legalization for the 11.7 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country. But the principles stopped short of offering a full pathway to citizenship, instead coming out in favor of legal status only.\nHow do the American people feel about immigration reform and a pathway to legal status only? Despite the many ways to phrase the question, five recent polls from January and February illustrate clearly that the public strongly supports immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, rejects approaches that would continue to give unauthorized immigrants second-class status, and will be disappointed if immigration reform fails to pass this year.\nHere are the five most recent polls on immigration.\n1. Gallup: Dealing with unauthorized immigrants already in the country trumps border security (February 2014)\nGallup\u2019s most recent polling on immigration found that more Americans believe that dealing with unauthorized immigrants living in the United States is more important than securing the nation\u2019s borders. While Americans are almost split on the two issues, with 44 percent in favor of first dealing with the unauthorized and 43 percent in favor of first securing the border, the survey shows a big shift from just a few years ago. In 2011, Gallup found that Americans favored securing the border first by 10 percentage points\u201453 percent to 43 percent.\nDigging into the data illustrates that support for securing the border first has declined among both Republicans and Democrats. Support among Republicans, for example, decreased from 68 percent in 2011 to only 56 percent in 2014; while among Democrats, it has dropped from 42 percent to 31 percent. Still, it is important to note that legal status and border security can occur on parallel tracks, as in the Senate immigration reform bill, which makes unprecedented investments in border security and enforcement while providing a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.\nThis polling follows attempts by members of both parties to provide a pathway to legal status for unauthorized immigrants, either through the Senate-passed immigration reform plan or the Republican principles released in January.\n2. CNN/ORC International: Legalizing unauthorized immigrants is our first immigration priority, and Americans support a full pathway to citizenship (February 2014)\nJust more than half of all Americans in a CNN/ORC International poll argued that the first priority on immigration should be providing a pathway to legal status for unauthorized immigrants living in the country, while only 41 percent believed that stopping unauthorized immigration should be the top priority. These results stand in sharp relief to similar polling done in 2011 and before, when a majority of Americans believed that stopping unauthorized immigration should come before allowing unauthorized immigrants access to legal status. As CNN Polling Director Keating Holland argued, \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 insistence that border security be the primary focus of U.S. immigration policy may have been a popular stand in 2011, but not necessarily in 2014.\u201d\nOverall, 8 out of 10 Americans believed that unauthorized immigrants who have been in the country for years and are employed, speak English, and would pay back taxes should be allowed to become citizens, while nearly two-thirds of those polled stated that they would oppose a bill that only granted legal status but no way to achieve citizenship. Both of these results were more or less consistent regardless of whether the respondent was a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent. It is clear from the poll that the American public supports a full pathway to citizenship, not the granting of merely second-class legal status.\n3. Global Strategy Group/Basswood Research: 74 percent of voters will be disappointed if Congress does not pass immigration reform (February 2014)\nA new poll by Democratic polling firm Global Strategy Group and Republican firm Basswood Research found that nearly 79 percent of all Americans want immigration reform, and nearly three out of four Americans will be disappointed if Congress fails to act. Despite members of Congress saying that immigration reform can wait, it is clear that voters disagree.\nMore importantly, Americans are strongly in favor of the main components of immigration reform: Two-thirds of all Americans support a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, including a majority of Republican voters. When it comes to DREAMers\u2014young unauthorized immigrants\u2014nearly 9 out of 10 voters support allowing them to become citizens. Other major provisions of immigration reform\u2014including securing the border, creating a new merit-based immigration visa, and mandating electronic employment verification\u2014all have around 80 percent approval rates.\n4. CBS News: The majority of Americans favor the pathway to citizenship and soundly reject legal-status-only approaches (January 2014)\nIn a CBS News poll, a majority of Americans\u201454 percent\u2014felt that unauthorized immigrants should be allowed to become citizens. Importantly, while most Americans are in favor of the pathway to citizenship, they strongly reject approaches that would leave unauthorized immigrants with second-class status: Only 12 percent of respondents believed that unauthorized immigrants should receive legal status but not be able to become citizens. Two-thirds of Democrats supported the pathway to citizenship, while only 43 percent of Republicans did. However, a smaller percentage of Republicans\u20149 percent\u2014than any other group supported a legal-status-only approach to immigration reform. This final result should give pause to congressional leadership as they propose, as Republicans did with their immigration principles, legalization without citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.\n5. Fox News: More than two-thirds of Americans support the pathway to citizenship and reject mass deportation (January 2014)\nWhen asked, \u201cWhich of the following comes closest to your view about what government policy should be toward undocumented immigrants currently in the United States?\u201d, 68 percent of Americans favored a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants in the country if they meet requirements such as paying back taxes and passing background checks. Support for requiring all unauthorized immigrants to be sent back to their home countries stood at only 15 percent. Support for the pathway to citizenship has increased slightly, by 2 percent, since May 2013, while support for sending unauthorized immigrants home has dropped 5 percent.\nConclusion\nJust one week after releasing the House Republican principles, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) fanned the flames of his own party, stating that members could not move forward on immigration because they lacked trust that President Barack Obama will enforce the laws. But these arguments\u2014and those voices in the Republican Party urging a delay in immigration reform until next year, at the earliest\u2014do not actually challenge the substance of reform proposals, or even the substance of the Republicans\u2019 own principles regarding immigration reform. Instead, they tacitly accept the premise that immigration reform should happen without actually moving it forward.\nAs Greg Sargent of The Washington Post points out, \u201cGOP stalling on immigration is not about \u2018distrust of Obama.\u2019\u201d From the polling above, it is clear that it is not about public opinion either. Americans support immigration reform, including the pathway to citizenship, and will be disappointed if Congress fails to pass legislation this year. The window for acting on immigration reform is open through 2014, the public supports it, and now is the time for the House to step up and pass it.\nPhilip E.

{{The American Jewish Congress has condemned as \u201castonishing and shocking\u201d the testimony by West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger that he did not realize until World War II was nearly over that \u201csomething ugly was happening to the Jews of Europe.\u201d Mr. Kiesinger was \u201ceither blind to what was happening\u201d around him \u201cor deliberately closed his eyes,\u201d Dr. Joachim Prinz, chairman of the AJCongress\u2019 Commission on International Affairs, said in a telegram to the West German Chancellor.\nDr. Prinz of Newark, N.J., a former rabbi of Berlin who was expelled from Germany in 1937 for his repeated public criticism of the Hitler regime, noted that Mr. Kiesinger had been a member of the Nazi Party before and during the war and said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that he could not have seen or known that \u201csomething ugly\u201d was happening to the Jews of Germany starting in 1933 and to the Jews of Nazi-occupied Europe starting in 1941.\nMr. Kiesinger\u2019s testimony was given last week as a defense witness in a war-crimes trial for a man accused of complicity in the murder of over 30,000 Bulgarian and Greek Jews during 1942-43. During the war years, the Chancellor was deputy leader of the radio monitoring department of the Nazi Foreign Ministry. Observers at the trial had the impression that Mr. Kiesinger seemed to be defending his own past as much as testifying for the defense.\nDr. Prinz told the Chancellor in the telegram that \u201cyou and the German people stand charged with knowledge of the Nazis\u2019 morally malevolent design for Europe from Hitler\u2019s first pronouncement in which he made no secret of his intention to destroy German Jewry and to subject European civilization to a reign of barbarism and terror. Your testimony before the court is a sign of the inexcusable moral torpor that characterized the German people during World War II and that renders them responsible and accountable for the awful and ugly extermination of six million of Europe\u2019s Jews.\u201d\n}}
{{Dear Senator Feinstein:\nOn Thursday, when you responded to news about massive ongoing surveillance of phone records of people in the United States, you slipped past the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. As the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, you seem to be in the habit of treating the Bill of Rights as merely advisory.\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t get any better than this: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d\nThe greatness of the Fourth Amendment explains why so many Americans took it to heart in civics class, and why so many of us treasure it today. But along with other high-ranking members of Congress and the president of the United States, you have continued to chip away at this sacred bedrock of civil liberties.\nAs The Guardian reported the night before your sudden news conference, the leaked secret court order \u201cshows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of U.S. citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk \u2014 regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.\u201d\nOne of the most chilling parts of that just-revealed Surveillance Court order can be found at the bottom of the first page, where it says \u201cDeclassify on: 12 April 2038.\u201d\nApparently you thought \u2014 or at least hoped \u2014 that we, the people of the United States, wouldn\u2019t find out for 25 years. And the fact that we learned about this extreme violation of our rights in 2013 instead of 2038 seems to bother you a lot.\nRather than call for protection of the Fourth Amendment, you want authorities to catch and punish whoever leaked this secret order. You seem to fear that people can actually discover what their own government is doing to them with vast surveillance.\nMeanwhile, the Executive Branch is being run by kindred spirits, as hostile to the First Amendment as to the Fourth. On Thursday night, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement saying the \u201cunauthorized disclosure of a top secret U.S. court document threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation.\u201d\nThat statement from Clapper is utter and complete hogwash. Whoever leaked the four-page Surveillance Court document to Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian deserves a medal and an honorary parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in the Nation\u2019s Capital. The only \u201cthreats\u201d assisted by disclosure of that document are the possibilities of meaningful public discourse and informed consent of the governed.\nLet\u2019s be candid about the most clear and present danger to our country\u2019s democratic values. The poisonous danger is spewing from arrogance of power in the highest places. The antidotes depend on transparency of sunlight that only whistleblowers, a free press and an engaged citizenry can bring.\nAs Greenwald tweeted after your news conference: \u201cThe reason there are leakers is precisely because the govt is filled with people like Dianne Feinstein who do horrendous things in secret.\u201d And, he pointed out, \u201cThe real story isn\u2019t just the spying itself: it\u2019s that we have this massive, ubiquitous Surveillance State, operating in total secrecy.\u201d\nObviously, you like it that way, and so do most other members of the Senate and House. And so does the president. You\u2019re all playing abhorrent roles, maintaining a destructive siege of precious civil liberties. While building a surveillance state, you are patting citizens on the head and telling them not to worry.\nPerhaps you should have a conversation with Al Gore and ask about his statement: \u201cIs it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?\u201d Actually, many millions of Americans understand that the blanket surveillance is obscenely outrageous.\nAs a constituent, I would like to offer an invitation. A short drive from your mansion overlooking San Francisco Bay, hundreds of us will be meeting June 11 at a public forum on \u201cDisappearing Civil Liberties in the United States.\u201d (You\u2019d be welcome to my time on the panel.) One of the speakers, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, could explain to you how the assaults on civil liberties and the wars you keep supporting go hand in hand, undermining the Constitution and causing untold misery.\nSenator Feinstein, your energetic contempt for the Bill of Rights is serving a bipartisan power structure that threatens to crush our democratic possibilities.\nA huge number of people in California and around the country will oppose your efforts for the surveillance state at every turn.\nSincerely,\nNorman Solomon\n}}
{{At this point, the polls are pretty consistent: Americans are angry about the budget and shutdown shenanigans in Washington, but they\u2019re angrier at Republicans than they are at Democrats. Which should tell you something about who is really to blame for this mess.\nBut Public Policy Polling took things a step further, asking people whether they preferred Congress to a series of ailments, celebrities, serial killers and oft-loathed government agencies. Here's what the polling group found:\nAmericans currently have a higher opinion of witches (46/32), jury duty (73/18) and hemorrhoids (53/31) than Congress. Republicans seem much more accepting of Congress over hemorrhoids compared to other voters -- 41% favored Congress more than the diseases, as opposed to only 25% of Democrats and 27% of Independents.\nEven government institutions like the DMV and the IRS are seen as more favorable than Congress currently, at 58/24 and 42/33 respectively. Almost twice as many Republicans still support Congress over the IRS (48/25), while only 23% of Democrats do (23/59).\nHalf of registered voters have a higher opinion of Congress than of Anthony Weiner right now (50/23). In fact, public figures are some of the only people that registered voters dislike more than the legislature.\nAmericans thought higher of Congress when asked about Vladimir Putin (49/28), Charles Manson (56/18), Honey Boo Boo (42/33) and Miley Cyrus (36/31) \u2013 with \"twerking\" also four points below Congress at 37/33.\n\u201cCongress having an 8% approval rating tells us one thing about how unhappy voters are,\u201d said Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. \u201cBut it\u2019s even more telling that voters have a lower opinion of it than annoyances like the DMV and jury duty, health issues like hemorrhoids, and even witches.\u201d\nA poll like this almost seems like a practical joke, but it\u2019s not. Public Policy Polling did a similar poll earlier this year, during the last debt ceiling fight, said polling specialist Jim Williams. \u201cOur director, Tom Jensen, said \u2018Let\u2019s do a poll comparing Congress to a bunch of things people think are terrible. It\u2019s for fun, but it\u2019s not made up.'\u201d\nThat poll, conducted in January, found Congress less popular than root canals, head lice, colonoscopies and Brussel sprouts.\nALSO:\n2 ordered to stand trial in slayings of USC grad students\nPartial roof collapse at Tustin blimp hangar 2nd incident in a week\nCounty considers raising price of L.A.

{{Dini has been watching with bated breath for the past 14 months as a bill that would allow the city of Yerington to buy 10,000 acres of federal land around the Pumpkin Hollow mine site for commercial, industrial, and recreational use has stalled in the Senate.\n\"People who are thinking about moving on ask me daily how the legislation is going,\" he said. \"At this point, I'm saying they should look elsewhere. We've been working on this bill for 14 months. I can't keep looking them in the face and tell them it's just going to be a few more months.\"\nIn Nevada, this isn't an altogether uncommon problem. In fact, the federal government owns about 86 percent of the state's land. If Republicans are looking for tangible proof that the federal government's involvement is hurting economic development (a common rallying cry), Yerington is a good example.\n\"It's hard for the state's economy to grow if you can't have a larger footprint,\" said Rep. Mark Amodei, the Republican who first introduced the bill early last year.\nWhat is perhaps most frustrating to residents of Yerington is that there seem to be no objections to the bill, at least not from the Nevada delegation. The bill passed out of the House with no problem, and after the inclusion of a provision that would designate other Nevada land as protected wilderness, Senate Majority Leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid gave it his support in December.\nReid and his Republican counterpart, Senator Dean Heller, reintroduced the bill this year, but there is still no timeline on when it will see any action.\n\"We have political disagreements all the time around here, but this is not that,\" Amodei said. \"Here we have a land transfer for full value with no cost to the taxpayers or the government. Who is opposed to that? You know what, nobody.\"\nAmodei noted that the mine did not violate any National Environmental Policy Act concerns, which has been a problem for Yerington in the past.\nEven though it's not really a partisan issue, the struggles of this bill manage to elucidate the difficulties of turning a bill into a law. The bill may have had no objections, but unfortunately it never got the opportunity to be judged on its own merits. Instead, it was wrapped up with 15 other land bills in an omnibus package that was destined to die in the Senate. That larger bill included, among other things, a provision to let Border Patrol agents bypass environmental laws where they found them inconvenient, creating what Democrats called a \"drone zone\" through several national parks.\nThings were made even harder by the fact that Senator Tom Coburn, R-Okla., was so strongly against land bills in general that he took to placing holds on them so they couldn't be brought up for a vote.\nIn December, it finally seemed like the bill was making forward progress. Dini, the mayor, says Reid told him that it would happen before the end of the year. But with the fiscal cliff taking all the oxygen out of Congress, even the majority leader couldn't make it happen for his constituents.\n}}
{{WASHINGTON \u2013 The House of Representatives approved a landmark bill Nov. 29 to pay $4.6 billion in compensation to African American farmers and Native Americans in reparation for decades of racist discrimination by the federal government. The vote was 256 to 152 with only 13 Republicans voting in the affirmative. The Senate had already approved the legislation Nov. 19 on a voice vote, meaning the measure will be sent to President Obama for his signature.\nRalph Paige, executive director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives / Land Assistance Fund, hailed the victory in the so-called \u201cPigford II\u201d lawsuit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming and it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. Paige\u2019s organization represents thousands of African American farmers joined in cooperatives across the south.\nElouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Tribe from Browning Montana and the lead plaintiff in the Indian case called it a \u201chistoric day in Indian country as well as in America\u2019s history.\u201d Her tribe\u2019s case, Cobell vs. Salazar was settled a year ago after more than 13 years of litigation. In addition to a $1.4 billion trust fund, it also creates $60 million scholarship funds, and creates a $2 billion fund for the federal government to repurchase tribal lands sold to individuals over the past hundred years or so, all of which will be turned over to the tribes.\nIn a phone interview from his office in East Point, Georgia, Paige cautioned that even after the legislation is signed, black farmers will wait to receive their compensation checks until an adjudicator and a federal judge weighs the merits of claims on a case-by-case basis.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this is a done deal,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the bigger issue is going beyond the settlement. Hopefully this will be the final chapter and all the discrimination will be left behind us. Its good for the country.\u201d\nPaige expressed amazement that lawmakers who voted for hundreds of billions in bailouts for Wall Street banks and General Motors could take the floor and rant about \u201cfraud\u201d in the bias claims by Black farmers. \u201cIts unreal to hear them talking about \u2018fraud.\u2019 It was clear from the beginning that these Black farmers were victims of discrimination. That\u2019s why the court upheld their claims. Yet Congress voted to approve hundreds of billions in bank bailouts; CEOs paid themselves large bonuses and these lawmakers are silent. But when it\u2019s compensation for poor farmers, people of color, they are raising questions about \u2018fraud.'\u201d\nHe concluded, \u201cYou can never pay farmers enough for the land they lost, the livelihoods that have been lost.\u201d\nPaige said the settlement comes at a time people are demanding safe, nutritious, locally grown food. \u201cI think there is a big future for young people to go back into farming,\u201d he said. It depends on the availability of low-interest federal loans and other government incentives to make it possible, he said.\nA day before the House vote, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack urged the lawmakers to approve the package and send it to President Obama. He praised the bipartisanship in the Senate. Yet it came at a price: the GOP leadership demanded so-called \u201coffsets\u201d to make the package \u201cdeficit neutral.\u201d The Senators reprogrammed funds from the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program.\nSpeaking to reporters by telephone hookup from the White House, Vilsack said it is not as bad as it sounds. The WIC money was from a reserve fund set up to handle a flood of WIC applications that has not materialized.\nThe bill sets aside $1.15 billion to settle claims of racist discrimination against Black farmers by the USDA. It sets aside an additional $3.4 billion to compensate American Indians who were cheated out of billions in royalties for oil, gas and timber harvested from their lands because of Interior Department mismanagement.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly pleased with the Senate action providing adequate funds to settle these claims,\u201d Vilsack said.\nMeanwhile, Koch Oil admits stealing $31 million worth of oil from Indian tribes in Oklahoma by deliberately understating the quantity of oil they were pumping from wells on the reservations. The Interior Department would have been culpable in Koch\u2019s theft since federal law mandates that they manage oil and gas leases on tribal lands. Koch stole additional billions from taxpayers over the past forty years by lying on how much oil and gas they were pumping from federal lands. Some of that stolen oil and gas paid for the billionaire Koch brother\u2019s drive to steal the Nov. 2 midterm elections by secretly funding a campaign of lies and smears targeting Democratic incumbents. The Koch brothers have doled out at least $100 million to bankroll the Tea Party and a network of other rightwing extremist gangs.\nImage: Farmlands were the sight of racist thievery.

{{WASHINGTON -- It's pretty rare that members of Congress and all the witnesses they've called will declare out loud that Americans are just too ignorant to be given a piece of information, but that was a key conclusion of a session of the House Agriculture Committee this week.\nThe issue was genetically modified organisms, or GMOs as they're often known in the food industry. And members of the subcommittee on Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture, as well as their four experts, agreed that the genetic engineering of food crops has been a thorough success responsible for feeding the hungry, improving nutrition and reducing the use of pesticides.\nPeople who oppose GMOs or want them labeled so that consumers can know what they're eating are alarmists who thrive on fear and ignorance, the panel agreed. Labeling GMO foods would only stoke those fears, and harm a beneficial thing, so it should not be allowed, the lawmakers and witnesses agreed.\n\"I really worry that labeling does more harm than good, that it leads too many people away from it and it diminishes the market for GMOs that are the solution to a lot of the problems we face,\" said David Just, a professor at Cornell University and co-director of the Cornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs.\nRep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) agreed with Just and asked him, \"What is the biggest drawback? Is it the ignorance of what the product is, just from a lack of education?\"\n\"It is ignorance of the product, and it's a general skepticism of anything they eat that is too processed or treated in some way that they don't quite understand,\" Just said.\n\"Even using long scientific-sounding words make it sound like it's been grown in a test tube, and people get scared of it,\" Just added.\nRep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) agreed with another witness, Calestous Juma, an international development professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, that political leaders had been cowed by misinformed populaces into bending on GMOs, especially in the European Union, where Juma said hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on studies that have found GMOs safe.\n\"It's obvious that while the science in the EU in incontrovertible about the health and safety benefits of genetically modified hybrid crops, that because of politics, people are afraid to lead, and inform consumers,\" Schrader said.\nJuma cited an extensive report by the European Commission. (There is at least one controversial group that disagrees with him.)\nCertainly, there is misinformation about GMOs, as highlighted in a New York Times feature on a Hawaiian ban of most GMOs. But entirely missing from the hearing was any suggestion that there are real concerns about the impact of genetically engineered food, such as the growth of pesticide-resistant \"super weeds,\" over-reliance on single-crop factory farming, decreased biodiversity, and a lack of a consistent approval process. (Read more pros and cons here.)\nThe issue may soon gain fresh relevance on Capitol Hill, where a measure backed by Reps. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) and G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) to stop states from requiring GMO labeling could get marked up as early as September. The bill also would allow genetically engineered food to be labeled \"100 percent natural.\"\nThe idea of the bill brought Ben and Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield to Capitol Hill Thursday to push back, along with Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who backs labeling.\nGreenfield told HuffPost that labeling is a simple, inexpensive matter of letting people know what's in their food, and letting them decide what they want to support and eat.\n\"This idea that consumers will be scared away -- the label will be a very simple thing, a few words on a container saying something like 'may be produced with genetic engineering.' It's not scary,\" Greenfield said.\nWatch the video above to see experts and members of Congress conclude Americans should be denied GMO labels because they are too ignorant, as well as Greenfield's reaction.\n}}
{{WASHINGTON \u2014 Washington Redskins president Bruce Allen said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday that the football team\u2019s nickname is \u201crespectful\u201d toward Native Americans.\nOn Thursday, half the U.S. Senate urged NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to change the club\u2019s name, saying it is a racist slur and it is time to replace it.\nThe franchise responded by releasing Allen\u2019s letter.\n\u201cOur use of `Redskins\u2019 as the name of our football team for more than 80 years has always been respectful of and shown reverence toward the proud legacy and traditions of Native Americans,\u201d he wrote.\nThe letter references research that \u201cthe term Redskins originated as a Native American expression of solidarity.\u201d It notes that the team\u2019s logo was designed by Native American leaders and cites surveys that Native Americans and Americans as a whole support the name.\nRedskins owner Daniel Snyder has refused to change the name, citing tradition, but there has been growing pressure including statements in recent months from President Barack Obama, lawmakers of both parties and civil rights groups. Last month, Reid took to the Senate floor to say Snyder should \u201cdo what is morally right\u201d and change the name.\nIn a letter Thursday, 49 senators mentioned the NBA\u2019s quick action recently to ban Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life after he was heard on an audio recording making offensive comments about blacks. They said Goodell should formally push to rename the Redskins.\n\u201cWe urge you and the National Football League to send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports,\u201d read the letter, which did not use the word \u201cRedskins.\u201d\nSen. Bill Nelson of Florida wrote his own letter saying he doesn\u2019t believe that retaining the Redskin name \u201cis appropriate in this day and age.\u201d\nIn a written response Thursday, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said \u201cthe intent of the team\u2019s name has always been to present a strong, positive and respectful image.\u201d\nReid and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington led the letter-writing effort. All senators on the letter are Democrats. Cantwell spokesman Jared Leopold said Republicans were not asked to participate.\nThe senators noted that tribal organizations representing more than 2 million Native Americans across the U.S. have said they want the Redskins name dropped.\nDespite federal laws protecting their identity, \u201cEvery Sunday during football season, the Washington, D.C., football team mocks their culture,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe NFL can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name as anything but what it is: a racial slur.\u201d\nPhoto via Twitter/@ESPNNFL\n}}
{{As we begin a divided 116th Congress with government funding uncertainty, Congress will soon find itself in another financial predicament \u2014 securing defense spending levels on par with the needs of our Department of Defense.\nWhile the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allowed for important growth and investments in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, with sequestration looming, we now find ourselves in a perilous scenario with this year\u2019s defense budget deliberations. Without a legislative fix in the coming months, we will lose the momentum that we have worked so hard to build.\nAs Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer described it recently: \u201cWe\u2019ve laid the foundation and spent this money to get us going in the right direction. The bicycle is up, we are pedaling; please don\u2019t knock us over.\u201d\nCongress delivered for our service members the past two years in a bipartisan manner, and we must do so again.\nFor the past two years, we have seen how defense budgets that match the needs of our military can deliver overwhelmingly positive results in crucial areas such as readiness, training and procurement. For instance, the recently passed HR 6157 (the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019) supported our war fighters by including a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops \u2014 the largest pay raise in nine years. The bill also looked forward by including $144 billion for increased troop levels of 1,338,100 active-duty and 817,700 Guard and Reserve forces \u2014 meeting the requested 16,400 end-strength increases.\nTo restore readiness, the bill provided $245.9 billion, an increase of $9.3 billion above base FY18 funding levels, for training, maintenance and base operations. And as a direct benefit to service members, the bill replenished equipment procurement accounts with $148 billion while including $96 billion for research and development for new technologies.\nWithout these increased defense budget caps the past two years, we could never have achieved these results for our service members.\nWe must continue this positive trend in FY20, and I am already encouraged by the initial efforts of my congressional colleagues and President Donald Trump. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, and Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas,, the House Armed Services Committee ranking member, called on President Trump to submit an FY20 national defense budget with a funding level of $733 billion, which aligns with the National Defense Strategy.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for our Early Bird Brief\nTo his credit, President Trump knows that our military is at a critical funding juncture and has reportedly backed a $750 billion top-line figure for FY20. Whether Congress ultimately stays at $750 billion, $733 billion or somewhere in between, we must pass a bipartisan budget cap that lifts the arbitrary limit, or the large-number rhetoric will be for naught.\nWithout a deal, the Budget Control Act would limit FY20 defense spending at $578 billion \u2014 a drop off of roughly $81 billion from a year ago. These low spending levels would begin to reverse the progress we have made and weaken our armed forces. We can\u2019t let that happen.\nI call on both my defense-hawk and fiscal-hawk colleagues to support a bipartisan budget cap deal for the benefit of our military. While power in the House of Representatives changed when the calendar flipped from 2018 to 2019, the threats in the world did not. Nor should our prioritization for defense. I understand and share concerns about our nation\u2019s growing national debt, but we should not discipline the military for Congress\u2019 inability to manage the country\u2019s finances. According to information derived from the Office of Management and Budget, national defense spending only accounted for 15 percent of the 2017 budget, while major entitlement programs accounted for 52 percent. Worse, by 2023 our nation is projected to spend more on servicing the public debt than on defense spending by over $20 billion. I believe that tough spending decisions need to be made, but they should not come at the expense of our national defense.\nThe past two years of defense spending have put our nation\u2019s military in a position to grow, strengthen and prosper. Our funding levels should be continued in FY20 and enabled by a budget cap deal to stem the effects of sequestration. Our military depends on it. Our country\u2019s security depends on it. Let\u2019s not get knocked off track.\n}}
{{Though a member of the intelligence committee beginning in 2001, he didn't know about the Bush administration's warrantless-wiretapping program until The New York Times reported on it in 2005 (after holding the story for more than a year). \"He was surprised again when, six months later, USA Today published a different story revealing for the first time that the NSA was secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, records that US telecoms were willingly handing over without a warrant,\" Kim Zetter notes at Wired.\nThese two examples are sufficient to show that during the Bush years he was denied information of the utmost relevance to an overseer. And now under President Obama there are equally clear examples of information he requires but is denied.\nOne example concerns Executive Order 12333, one of the primary legal authorities the NSA cites to justify some of its overseas intelligence gathering. What kind of surveillance does it enable in practice? How many Americans have their privacy compromised by spying carried out under that order? Congress has no clue.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re at the bottom or close to it,\" Wyden told Wired.\nSome context is needed to grasp the significance. In response to Edward Snowden's revelations about the phone dragnet, legislators are considering steps to better protect the private communications of Americans. But Congress cannot strike whatever balance it desires between surveillance and privacy if members don't even know what the spy agency does under legal cover of executive orders. Wyden suspects that the White House and intelligence community \"agreed to halt the phone records collection program, in the wake of intense criticism, only because the spy agency has other tricks to get the same data.\"\nIs he correct? The fact that one of the most interested members of the Senate Intelligence Committee doesn't know is a glaring problem. On the whole, American legislators have only the vaguest idea what the NSA does under Executive Order 12333, and this ignorance is a direct impediment to sound policymaking.\nIt makes adequate oversight impossible, so the conceit that the NSA is subject to \"strict oversight\" is absurd. Yet even as Senate Intelligence Committee members are kept ignorant of these vital facts, Carrie Cordero, director of national security studies at Georgetown University Law Center, writes as if the intelligence community now errs on the side of transparency. She urges these officials to tell Americans more about the terrorist menace. Any accurate information is useful, but how about first giving Senate overseers all the facts they need as overseers?\nSuppressing this information neuters Congress.\nLegislators preparing to vote on the USA Freedom Act conspicuously lack important facts needed to assess the adequacy and wisdom of the bill. Why do so few care?\n}}

{{I am frustrated that Congress continues its assault on Americans struggling with poverty. The House of Representatives just released its new budget which will significantly cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps). SNAP lifted nearly 5 million people out of poverty in 2013 and the main reason it did this was because the program is designed to respond to changes in the economy. Enrollment goes up when the economy is bad and goes down when the economy improves. Making SNAP a block grant would eliminate this feature, force states to reduce benefits and cause millions of America's most vulnerable to go hungry.\nLawmakers forget that the primary beneficiaries of SNAP are children, the elderly, veterans and the disabled. Do they ignore that SNAP has been shown to improve nutrition and health outcomes in children? Do they balk at SNAP's 96 percent accuracy and only one percent fraud rate? The simple fact is that if SNAP were a corporate program, Congress would be holding it up as a model of effectiveness and efficiency. When it comes to reducing hunger and poverty, our investments in SNAP are working. Congress should not mess with such a highly effective program.\nSusan Joseph Rack, Martinsville\nVaccine exemptions endanger public health\nThose opposed to legislative efforts to tighten standards for vaccine exemptions are doing a tremendous disservice that will endanger public health if successful. Their personal-freedom argument smacks more of personal selfishness than a constitutional ideal of individual liberty.\nI'm politically conservative, but I'm also a dad and granddad who remembers pre-vaccine days when kids died from diseases that are now vaccine preventable. Who wants to see those days again?\nVaccines are safe and effective. But a refusal to vaccinate breaks down collective immunity from disease. A simple case of measles, side effects like encephalitis aside, is fatal to someone immunocompromised by cancer or AIDS.\nExemptions from vaccination standards should be hard to get because nobody has the right to behave in a way that endangers the health of others.\nScott St. Clair, Belleville\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.

{{WASHINGTON , April 18 -- The office of Sen. Rob Portman , R- Ohio , issued the following news release:\nU.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor last evening on Tax Day, the last time American's will file under our old, broken, burdensome tax code. While American's won't file their taxes under the new code until this time next year, workers, families, and businesses are already benefiting from tax reform. Portman highlighted the successes he's seen across the state since the first of the year, including his visit to Cincinnati -headquartered Kroger on Monday.\nSaid Portman in the speech, \"I'm excited to be here today to say this is the last day we'll have to file under the old tax code--but also to say the new tax code is helping to give families I represent the opportunity to do a little better, to give businesses I represent the opportunity to be more competitive and reinvest in their employees and business and productivity. That will make the biggest difference in the tax reform effort.\"\nTranscript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here (https://youtu.be/fs-DnUZkoWM).\n\"I just got the chance to hear my colleague from Nevada talk about the importance of the tax cuts and tax reform that this chamber passed at the end of the year and is now in effect. All I can say to my constituents is this is the last year you're going to have to file under the old code. Now you have the new code next year.\n\"Why is that important? Because it's simpler--it doubles the standard deduction as an example, which is a great simplification for a lot of taxpayers. It also takes about three million people off the tax rolls altogether. Think about that: according to the Joint Committee on Taxation , over three million Americans who currently have income tax liability will no longer have it under this new tax reform bill.\n\"Why? Because it focuses on lowering the rates, doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit. That helps people who are lower-income Americans who right now have tax liability who won't in the future. So it will be easier for a lot of people a year from now because they will have no tax filing to make because they won't have any tax liability, and for others it's just a simpler form.\n\"Although what's happening already this year is that the paychecks are changing. Why? Because the IRS is saying that employees are going to get more money in their paycheck because the employers are going to withhold less as we go into the year 2018 because the tax proposals are in effect at the beginning of this year.\n\"So even though this is the last time that we are going to have to file under the old code, already people are seeing some of the benefits of tax reform. When I go around Ohio , I talk to people. They say, 'Rob, my paycheck has already changed.' That's because 90 percent of Americans are now being told they will have less withholding taken out of their paychecks, again because of the lower tax rate, doubling the child tax credit, doubling the standard deduction. This is really helping.\n\"The average in Ohio is probably $30 , $40 , maybe $50 every two weeks. The average savings for a median income family is about $2,000 a year in tax relief. That's the average. That's a big deal. That's not just crumbs.\n\"Most people I represent live paycheck to paycheck. Most people I represent think $2,000 is really helpful. By the way, they told me they are using it--it might be for a long-planned vacation they couldn't afford. It might be, as a couple of people have told me, to help with regard to health care because they couldn't afford to buy health care until they had that extra $2,000 or more in their pocket for some people to be able to afford health care. For others, we heard a great story this morning from my colleague in West Virginia about a woman who said her daughter used to have to do her schoolwork at school or maybe at the library. She couldn't come home and do it because they couldn't afford high-speed internet. Now she can afford high-speed internet with this tax relief that is being provided.\n\"This is something that is actually affecting people right now. As you go to the Post Office to mail your form today or as you send it in electronically, just know it's going to get a little bit better, a little simpler, a little less tax liability. By the way, the IRS has had some difficulty in accepting electronic filings today. Another reason we have to actually go beyond just tax reform, as important as that is, and we have to ensure that we have an IRS that is working for the American taxpayer. The taxpayer service, which is the number of calls that are being answered, the number of answers which are being given correctly, all those indicators are concerning right now.\n\"So we do need to ensure that the IRS has adequate funding to respond to taxpayers but also that there are reforms at the IRS , so that the computer systems do work, so that the stovepipe different systems are talking to each other.\n\"So tax reform and tax relief are very important, but also as we have seen today with this glitch with regard to electronic filing, we have to be sure that the IRS is up to the task and providing the taxpayer the service they deserve.\n\"The tax relief bill wasn't just for families and individuals. It also focuses on business relief. Why? Because we know that American companies were not competitive under the old code. You had investment going overseas, jobs going overseas. So for small businesses and large businesses alike, there is tax relief. We're hearing more about that because we have seen a lot of headlines, another one today about yet another major company that is making some investments here in this country.\n\"I was at the Kroger Company yesterday. Kroger is one of the largest employers in the United States , a great grocery store chain, the largest in the country, by the way. They happen to be headquartered in Ohio . They made a huge announcement yesterday. What they said is they are going to take the savings they got from the tax relief and tax reform measure and they're going to give it back substantially to their employees. And the things they talked about were really interesting. One is to increase the 401(k) match. That's important. They already give a 100 percent match. Now they will give it at five percent rather than four percent of people's salaries.\n\"That's nice because people can save more for their retirement. They talked about helping employees who had a tough time through an employee assistance program. They're increasing funding for that program. They are talking about applying an employee discount program so employees can buy more from their home stores, expanding how much they can buy with the discount. That helps their employees.\n\"But they also talked about something I thought was really great, which is continuous education, lifelong learning. They said that they are going to provide their employees with a $3,500 a year stipend to continue their education. Maybe it's getting a GED, maybe it's getting an MBA, or everything in between. They believe in education. They want to be able to help these employees be able to better themselves. They believe that will help them, too, to keep people longer term.\n\"This is part of how they are using the tax reform. By the way, it's applicable to everybody who has been there six months. You can be part-time or full-time. You can get this employee assistance for education, all coming from the tax relief that this body passed.\n\"Is it making a difference in the lives of your constituents? It certainly is in the lives of mine, I can tell you that. I have been to 13 different businesses now around the state of Ohio . I have asked them this question directly, what's happening, what are you doing? All of them tell me they are investing in their people or their plant and equipment, helping buy new technology so that people can be more competitive, more effective at doing their job.\n\"I have also had a half dozen roundtable discussions where I bring small-business owners together, and dozens of businesses have told me what they are doing. Some are providing more health care coverage, in a couple of cases. One is a small craft brewer in Ohio . Another is an auto parts company. They are providing health care to their employees for the first time. In one case they had before it got too expensive because of the Affordable Care Act. Now they are able to provide health care to their employees. Another one never provided health care because it's a small business just getting started. Now they can provide health care to their employees because of the savings from the tax bill.\n\"Others are doing much more in terms of the community charitable giving. Again, some with regard to 401(k)s, some with regard to new equipment and machines to make their employees more productive because when the economists look at what's going on in our economy, they think, 'gosh, the reason wages haven't gone up much in the last decade, and really it's been flat in Ohio , is because worker productivity has not been high enough.'\n\"This tax reform effort is providing more investment to our companies. I would much rather have people investing here in America than investing overseas. That's what was happening. Three times as many American companies were bought by foreign companies last year as the other way around because of our tax code. There is a study out by Ernst and Young saying 4,700 U.S. companies went overseas. When they do that, they take their investment with them. They take some of their R&D with them.\n\"We have done studies on this to be able to show this. 4,700 companies had gone overseas that would have stayed American companies just over the last 13 years if we had the kind of tax reform we now have in place. Those companies now have an incentive to invest here. Foreign companies have incentive to invest here. When they are trying to decide between investing in Japan , China , or Europe , now they look here and say, 'this is a lower tax rate and you get immediate expensing.' In other words when you buy something you can expense it more quickly, you can deduct it more quickly. The encourages investment here, whether you're an U.S. company or a foreign company. That's why this is exciting.\n\"There's some new information out from the Congressional Budget Office that talks about economic growth, and it says because of the tax reform effort, we're seeing higher growth rates. For this year we're in right now, the Congressional Budget Office projected two percent economic growth, pretty weak. I mean, it's growth, but it's not enough to get wages up or give people the opportunities they're looking for when they work hard and play by the rules.\n\"Guess what they are saying now? 3.3 percent, not two percent, but 3.3 percent economic growth were the projections for this year. Again, they say this is attributable to the pro-growth policies, including the tax reform effort we're talking about and the tax cuts. They also say for the first time in a long time we're seeing wages going up. They project wages up. Look at last month and the month before and you can see the wages start to creep back up again. That's really exciting to me because ultimately we want to see economic growth, yes, but we really want to see working families get a higher income so they are not stuck in the middle-class squeeze where their income is flat but their expenses are up. The biggest expense that has been increasing is health care. Yes, we have to do more on health care and do more to increase economic growth. Wouldn't it be good to have wages go up to be able to compensate for that, and to be able to give people this sense that if they do the right things in life, if they are willing to work hard, if they are willing to play by the rules, they can get ahead and their kids and grandkids can get ahead too.\n\"I'm excited to be here today to say this is the last day we'll have to file under the old tax code--but also to say the new tax code is helping to give families I represent the opportunity to do a little better, to give businesses I represent the opportunity to be more competitive and reinvest in their employees and business and productivity. That, ultimately, will make the biggest difference in the tax reform effort.\"\n}}
{{A Chinese employee looking at a solar cell production line at a factory in Nantong in Jiangsu Province in eastern China on March 28, 2018. (AFP/Getty Images)\nCongress to Pass Bill Aimed at Blocking China From Buying Up American Technologies\nWASHINGTON\u2014Both houses of Congress are set to pass legislation that would strengthen the scrutiny given to foreign purchases of American businesses with technologies critical to national security, making it easier to block such sales. Key proponents of the bill have repeatedly named China as the primary target, as Beijing has continued its aggressive industrial policy and espionage aimed at stealing U.S. technology.\nThe Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017, known as FIRRMA, was approved unanimously by the Senate Banking Committee on May 22. The House version of the bill, introduced by Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), was also approved 53-0 in the House Financial Services Committee. Now that the bill has cleared both Senate and House committees, Congress is expected to pass the bill soon with broad bipartisan support.\nThe bill would comprehensively modernize and strengthen the process by which the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews acquisitions, mergers, and other foreign investments in the United States for national security risks.\nHoused by the Treasury Department, CFIUS is a relatively small agency tasked with reviewing cases of foreign businesses purchasing U.S. firms. Created in the 1970s, CFIUS\u2019s ability to protect the American technological edge has been increasingly challenged in recent years, as China makes ever more attempts to buy U.S. firms and technology.\nOn May 22, an investigative report by the Politico revealed that the existing CFIUS framework failed to review a Chinese business magnate\u2019s purchase of an American semiconductor company in 2017. The case highlights the difficulty of reviewing acquisition deals that involve individual Chinese investors, some of which could have relations with or are even working for the Chinese regime.\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who sponsored the Senate bill, argued, as have other proponents of FIRRMA, that there is an urgent need for action as China vacuums up U.S. technologies whenever it can. China could conceivably use technologies stolen from the United States against it in a conflict, Cornyn said.\nSince FIRRMA was introduced in both houses last November, congressional members have been debating and revising the details of the bill, as segments of U.S. industry have raised concerns that it could create excessive restrictions for their doing business with China.\nAs a compromise, the eventual bill passed by the congressional committees the week of May 21 has scrapped a provision that would subject joint ventures between U.S. and foreign businesses to CFIUS review. Instead, the amended bill would create an interagency process for identifying critical emerging technologies and intellectual property not yet subject to export control.\n\u201cIt is absolutely essential for Congress to tighten CFIUS legislation to protect us from China\u2019s mercantilist policies,\u201d said China and East Asia analyst Gordon Chang. \u201cChina is stealing American innovations, which are the lifeblood of our economy.\u201d\nChang also called for policymakers in Washington to make CFIUS \u201cas strict as possible,\u201d so as to ensure that every Chinese acquisition of American companies and technology is in the interest of the United States, not of Beijing.\nU.S. observers have been increasingly alarmed by China\u2019s aggressive industrial policy, as exemplified by its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy devised in 2015, which explicitly states that the industrial goal of the Chinese regime is to catch up with rivals like the United States, Japan, and Germany in advanced technologies.\n}}
{{The United States Congress is a complex, confounding and controversial creature. This branch of government appeared to hold a special place in the hearts the Founding Fathers, who dedicated the entire Article I of the Constitution to a detailed definition of the powers and responsibilities of congressional members. It was originally intended to be the most powerful body of the government, but throughout the years it seems to have lost strength. According to most Americans, it has declined in its ability to work efficiently as well. Congress approval ratings have plummeted during the last decade due to constant political theatrics and an intensifying partisanship that is prevalent in both chambers.\nNevertheless, Congress is the singular institution of government that is truly elected by the American public. There is no sort of filtering screen that dilutes voter representation, such as how the president is elected through the electoral college. While one may conclude that the legislative branch is a better reflection of the electorate than the executive, the House of Representatives is the one of the only chambers of government that truly represents the votes of American people.\nEach state is represented by two senators, regardless of population. In the Senate, Wyoming, a state with a little more than half a million in population, has the same amount of seats as California, a state with almost 40 million people. The Senate is nowhere close to a proportional distribution of power, not when fifty diverse states are each allotted two senators. This arrangement has granted smaller states a disproportionate amount of political influence that can affect the rest of the country. Larger cities generally tend to be more racially and culturally diverse than in America\u2019s sparse rural areas, which means that a diverse government that is representative of its nation\u2019s demographics would be better to look after the interests of everybody. This seems impossible to accomplish with only two senators representing densely populated states. These geographical areas are home to millions of Americans, who are not composed of any one single race, religion, gender or class.\nThe Senate almost seems to be the complete opposite of the House of Representatives. The members of the lower chamber are elected according to the population and districts. In the recent midterm election, a record number of women were elected as representatives. These new congresswomen have all come from very different backgrounds. Some of them are extremely young, women of color, veterans, gay, Muslim or refugees. Many of them have a combination of several identities. Together, these fresh new faces are drastically shaping the House of Representatives into a sharper and more accurate reflection of the diverse population in the United States. As of this year, many more American voters are now able to say that their elected officials look like them, came from a similar background or practice their same religion. These representatives share the values and struggles of their constituents, and hopefully this understanding will be translated into legislation and conversations that have been neglected for far too long.\nPerhaps it is time to change the way that Americans elect candidates to the Senate in order to truly reflect the needs of the majority of the country\u2019s population. Although smaller states still deserve to have their voices heard and represented in government, the disproportionate power that their senators hold allows them to influence decisions for their entire country that may not represent the will of the people. The consequences of this are not limited to state boundaries. The Senate is not seeking solutions to address the problems of low-income and middle-class families and minorities because the majority of its members are not affected by the same issues as the rest of the country. Every vote should be equal in value rather than in having some be above others.

{{WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee is planning a Tuesday interview with a Russian-American lobbyist who attended a campaign meeting last year with President Donald Trump\u2019s son, according to a person familiar with the interview.\nThe staff interview behind closed doors with Rinat Akhmetshin is part of the committee\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as well as an ongoing investigation by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley into lax enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\nThe person familiar with the meeting declined to be identified because the appearance will not be publicly announced.\nThe panel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling has been stalled for weeks amid disputes between Republicans and Democrats. But Grassley has long said he wants to interview Akhmetshin about why he was not registered as a foreign agent.\nCongressional investigators are probing the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in New York with Donald Trump Jr., as is special counsel Robert Mueller. Akhmetshin was interviewed by the House intelligence panel Monday, and has also been interviewed by the Senate intelligence committee.\nIn emails ahead of the Trump Tower meeting, Trump Jr. enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after he was promised dirt on his father\u2019s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. has since denied such material ever materialized.\nAkhmetshin is a former military officer who has attracted congressional scrutiny over his political activities and has been shadowed by allegations of connections to Russian intelligence. Grassley said in a March letter that Akhmetshin has \u201creportedly admitted to being a \u2018Soviet counterintelligence officer\u2019 and has a long history of lobbying the U.S. government for pro-Russia matters.\u201d\nPeople who attended the 2016 Trump Tower meeting have made several appearances before congressional committees in recent months. The House intelligence committee earlier this month interviewed Ike Kaveladze, also known as Irakly Kaveladze, who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were also in the meeting. Kushner met with both intelligence panels privately this summer and Manafort met with the Senate panel. Trump Jr. had a private interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, but hasn\u2019t met with the intelligence committees.\nNorth Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, has said he wants to wait to interview Trump Jr. until after committee staff has interviewed other participants in the meeting. Asked last week if the committee has interviewed all those other people, Burr said, \u201cI think all but one.\u201d\nAlso attending the Trump Tower meeting were publicist Rob Goldstone, who set it up with the promise of dirt on Clinton, and a translator.\nAkhmetshin has said the Justice Department\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit sent him a letter in April and told him, \u201cit has come to our attention you should have filed for FARA.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t believe he needed to file. He has previously registered with Congress for the lobbying work, and he plans to raise this issue before Grassley\u2019s committee.\n\u201cI think I have a legal right to tell my story,\u201d he told The Associated Press earlier this year.\n}}
{{An inside look at his pre-war decisionmaking reveals how the public was misled and the constitution ignored.\nConfronted by this brutal repression and a looming humanitarian crisis, I ordered warships into the Mediterranean. European allies declared their willingness to commit resources to stop the killing. The Libyan opposition, and the Arab League, appealed to the world to save lives in Libya. At my direction, America led an effort with our allies at the United Nations Security Council to pass an historic Resolution that authorized a No0Fly Zone to stop the regime's attacks from the air, and further authorized all necessary measures to protect the Libyan people.\nIf you were president just then and you turned your television to some cable news channel you would have seen many Republican senators screaming at you to invade Libya and many Democratic congressmen hollering at you that you had no business putting American lives at risk in Libya. If you flipped over to the networks on March 7 you might have caught ABC White House correspondent Jake Tapper saying to your press secretary, Jay Carney, \"More than a thousand people have died, according to the United Nations. How many more people have to die before the United States decides, O.K., we're going to take this one step of a no-fly zone?\" By March 13, Qaddafi appeared to be roughly two weeks from getting to Ben\u00adgha\u00adzi. On that day the French announced they were planning to introduce a resolution in the United Nations to use U.N. forces to secure the skies over Libya in order to prevent Libyan planes from flying. A \"no-fly zone\" this was called, and it forced Obama's hand. The president had to decide whether to support the no-fly-zone resolution or not. At 4:10 p.m. on March 15 the White House held a meeting to discuss the issue. \"Here is what we knew,\" recalls Obama, by which he means here is what I knew. \"We knew that Qaddafi was moving on Benghazi, and that his history was such that he could carry out a threat to kill tens of thousands of people. We knew we didn't have a lot of time--somewhere between two days and two weeks. We knew they were moving faster than we originally anticipated. We knew that Europe was proposing a no-fly zone.\" That much had been in the news. One crucial piece of information had not. \"We knew that a no-fly zone would not save the people of Ben\u00adgha\u00adzi,\" says Obama. \"The no-fly zone was an expression of concern that didn't real\u00adly do anything.\" European leaders wanted to create a no-fly zone to stop Qaddafi, but Qaddafi wasn't flying. His army was racing across the North African desert in jeeps and tanks. Obama had to have wondered just how aware of this were these foreign leaders supposedly interested in the fate of these Libyan civilians. He didn't know if they knew that a no-fly zone was pointless, but if they'd talked to any military leader for five minutes they would have. And that was not all. \"The last thing we knew,\" he adds, \"is that if you announced a no-fly zone and if it appeared feckless, there would be additional pressure for us to go further. As enthusiastic as France and Britain were about the no-fly zone, there was a danger that if we participated the U.S. would own the operation. Because we had the capacity.\"\nObama insists that he still had not made up his mind what to do when he returned to the Situation Room -- that he was still considering doing nothing at all. A million people in Ben\u00adgha\u00adzi were waiting to find out whether they would live or die, and he honestly did not know. There were things the Pentagon might have said to deter him, for instance. \"If somebody had said to me that we could not take out their air defense without putting our fliers at risk in a significant way; if the level of risk for our military personnel had been ratcheted up--that might have changed my decision,\" says Obama. \"Or if I did not feel Sarkozy or Cameron were far enough out there to follow through. Or if I did not think we could get a U.N resolution passed.\" Once again he polled the people in the room for their views. Of the principals only Susan Rice (enthusiastically) and Hil\u00adlary Clinton (who would have settled for a no-fly zone) had the view that any sort of intervention made sense. \"How are we going to explain to the American people why we're in Libya,\" asked William Daley, according to one of those pres\u00adent. \"And Daley had a point: who gives a shit about Libya?\"\nFrom the president's point of view there was a certain benefit in the indifference of the American public to whatever was happening in Libya. It enabled him to do, at least for a moment, pretty much whatever he wanted to do. Libya was the hole in the White House lawn.\nObama made his decision: push for the U.N resolution and effectively invade another Arab country. Of the choice not to intervene he says, \"That's not who we are,\" by which he means that's not who I am. The decision was extraordinarily personal. \"No one in the Cabinet was for it,\" says one witness. \"There was no constituency for doing what he did.\" Then Obama went upstairs to the Oval Office to call European heads of state and, as he puts it, \"call their bluff.\" Cameron first, then Sarkozy. It was three a.m. in Paris when he reached the French president, but Sarkozy insisted he was still awake. (\"I'm a young man!\") In formal and stilted tones the European leaders committed to taking over after the initial bombing. The next morning Obama called Medvedev to make sure that the Russians would not block his U.N. resolution. There was no obvious reason why Russia should want to see Qad\u00adda\u00adfi murder a city of Libyans, but in the president's foreign dealings the Russians play the role that Republicans currently more or less play in his domestic affairs. The Russians' view of the world tends to be zero-sum: if an American president is for it, they are, by definition, against it. Obama thought that he had made more prog\u00adress with the Russians than he had with the Republicans; Medvedev had come to trust him, he felt, and believed him when he said the United States had no intention of moving into Libya for the long term. A senior American official at the United Nations thought that perhaps the Russians let Obama have his resolution only because they thought it would end in disaster for the United States.\nAnd it could have. All that exists for any president are the odds. On March 17 the U.N. gave Obama his resolution. The next day he flew to Brazil and was there on the 19th, when the bombing began. A group of Democrats in Congress issued a statement demanding Obama withdraw from Libya; Ohio Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich asked if Obama had just committed an impeachable offense. All sorts of people who had been hounding the president for his inaction now flipped and questioned the wisdom of action. A few days earlier Newt Gingrich, busy running for president, had said, \"We don't need the United Nations. All we have to say is that we think slaughtering your own citizens is unacceptable and that we're intervening.\" Four days after the bombing began, Gingrich went on the Today show to say he wouldn't have intervened and was quoted on Politico as saying, \"It is impossible to make sense of the standard of intervention in Libya except opportunism and news media publicity.\" The tone of the news coverage shifted dramatically, too. One day it was \"Why aren't you doing anything?\" The next it was \"What have you gotten us into?\" As one White House staffer puts it, \"All the people who had been demanding intervention went nuts after we intervened and said it was outrageous. That's because the controversy machine is bigger than the reality machine.\"\nThe imperial presidency is so well entrenched that a journalist like Michael Lewis needn't really question circumventing Congress to feel as though he's including all the crucial parts of the story about going to war.\nThe feature story that Michael Lewis just published about President Obama's decisionmaking prior to the war in Libya includes a lot of details that inspire confidence in his leadership. By all accounts he's intelligent, sober-minded, and inclined to seek out an array of perspectives. And he's frequently forced to make extraordinarily difficult tradeoffs with imperfect information. I don't envy his job.But the article also raises serious questions about his honesty and regard for the constitution. Let's take them in turn.On March 28, 2011, Obama gave a televised address about Libya. It included this passage about his actions:In his telling, (a) America led the effort to establish the No-Fly Zone; and (b) the No-Fly Zone would stop the Libyan regime's attacks from the air.Compare these assertions to the inside account reported by Lewis (which was vetted by the White House prior to publication):To summarize, (a) America did not lead the effort to establish a no-fly zone -- it reluctantly signed on to the idea after its hand was forced by the French; (b) the no-fly zone wouldn't stop the regime's attacks because they weren't coming from the air. It was, rather, a preamble to escalation.Due to the nature of the Libya conflict, these misrepresentations weren't nearly as consequential as, say, the way George W. Bush spoke out about weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq war. It is nevertheless an example of the president deliberately misleading the American people in order to facilitate false impressions about foreign military actions that he finds convenient.It's long been established that Obama failed to secure a congressional declaration of war, as the constitution and Senator Obama's understanding of it dictated; and that he violated the War Powers Resolution . It is nevertheless worth revisiting the subject given these new details about his thought process:Put more succinctly, going to war in Libya was a close call; there are things various folks could have said to deter him; he ran the decision through executive branch and international channels; most people told him not to do it; but if Congress came into the picture at all, it wasn't enough to merit mention in the retelling, and certainly not enough to follow the constitution and put the prospective war to a vote. The people's representatives were excluded.That remains a scandal.And it is telling that Michael Lewis, one of America's finest journalists, didn't even ask Obama about failing to put the decision about Libya before Congress. He didn't ask despite the plain language of the Constitution, Obama's prior statements indicating he fully understood his legal obligations, and the fact that various members of Congress complained about his unilateral action. The imperial presidency is so well entrenched that a journalist like Lewis needn't really question those things to feel as though he's including all the crucial parts of the story about going to war.That is quite a precedent Obama has set. And Mitt Romney is ready to exploit it if he wins. As he put it: \"I can assure you if I'm president, the Iranians will have no question but that I will be willing to take military action if necessary to prevent them from becoming a nuclear threat to the world. I don't believe at this stage, therefore, if I'm president that we need to have a war powers approval or special authorization for military force. The president has that capacity now.\"\n}}
{{Undaunted by their failure to catch so much as a single guppy, Republicans in Congress are paddling on with their fishing expedition through the Obama administration\u2019s clean-energy initiatives. They are nothing if not dutiful.\nThe latest faux scandal (what are we up to now? a dozen?) has to do with the Ivanpah solar power plant, currently under construction in the Mojave Desert in southeastern California.\nHere\u2019s what we know about Ivanpah, a concentrated solar power (CSP) project being developed by BrightSource Energy. It started construction in October 2010, amid great fanfare from politicians like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. It is technically three separate, contiguous power plants, built in phases, with a total of 170,000 heliostat mirrors, spread across 3,600 acres, aiming sunlight at three solar power towers. It will have a gross capacity of around 392 megawatts and will be, when completed, the largest CSP installation in the world.\nIn April 2011, the project got a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy (DOE), allowing it to scale up its already substantial private funding from, among others, NRG Solar and Google. A little over a year later, according to DOE, the project is about one-third completed and is employing over 1,700 people on site. When it\u2019s finished it will \u201cavoid 574,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to emissions of 110,000 vehicles\u201d and \u201cgenerate enough clean electricity to power approximately 87,000 homes annually.\u201d\nIn other words, DOE\u2019s investment has not failed. On the contrary, it\u2019s kind of awesome! Everything\u2019s going according to schedule. Jobs are being created. Barriers are being broken. If it proceeds according to plan, taxpayers won\u2019t shell out anything, California will get tons of clean energy and jobs, and the U.S. solar industry will have a domestic success story. Plus the thing is just gorgeous to look at.\nWho could possibly object to American jobs and energy? Serial car thief Darrell Issa and his merry band of fisherman (aka the House Oversight Committee), of course.\nWhy the concern? This Wall Street Journal piece contains the damning details. At least it contains the damning tone. The details turn out to be pretty unimpressive.\nHere\u2019s what happened: BrightSource had been scrambling for this Ivanpah loan for more than two years, since before Obama took office. All signs were positive. Problem was, a couple of deadlines were approaching. On March 31, 2011, the conditional agreement with DOE would lapse, and on April 1, \u201ctortoise moving season\u201d would start and delay the project for six more months, which may well have killed it. So BrightSource started sweating, hiring lobbyists, and pestering the DOE to finalize the damn thing. In early March it even proposed having its then-chairman John Bryson write his old friend, then-White House Chief of Staff William Daley, to plead with him to \u201cquarterback loan closure.\u201d\nIs there any evidence that this last-minute volley of lobbying had anything to do with the loan guarantee being approved? No. The letter was never sent to Daley. Buried down in paragraph 20, WSJ reveals that when loan-program director Jonathan Silver caught wind of Bryson\u2019s proposed letter, he responded within hours, telling him to tone it down, cut the \u201cquarterback\u201d crap, and chill out \u2014 the loan was \u201con track\u201d to close before the deadline. (Like many DOE loans, it was held up by a plodding review from a passive-aggressive OMB.)\nThat\u2019s it. As usual with these faux scandals, the media conspicuously fails to note that the last-minute lobbying and emails to the White House were all about hurrying up the review process, i.e., they came after the guarantees had been approved by DOE. There\u2019s not a shred of evidence that political connections or lobbying affected any of the loan decisions made by DOE staff. Here, as with the other faux scandals, there is only dark insinuation.\nInsinuation has no legal power, of course. These shows trials of individual DOE loans haven\u2019t uncovered any wrongdoing, much less anything worthy of official censure or criminal charges. And House Republicans have been fishing for over a year now. But this is post-truth politics \u2014 they don\u2019t need the reality of a scandal. That would be an unexpected bonus at this point. All they need is the atmospherics of scandal; they just need to keep floating broad charges and having the media cover them. The purpose is to keep DOE and Obama on the defensive, to hound them, to waste their energy, and to discredit clean energy.\nIf a thriving American business has to be sacrificed on that political altar, so be it.\n\u2014\u2014\nFor kicks, here\u2019s a slideshow from DOE on their clean energy programs:\nAnd here are links to three independent assessments of DOE\u2019s loan program:\nHerb Allison, former national finance chairman for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), led an independent review of the program.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service did its own analysis [PDF].\nThe research service Bloomberg Government did an analysis as well.\nAll these assessments found roughly the same thing: The program is making smart, low-risk investments and has cost over $2 billion less than expected. Unsurprisingly, the media has largely ignored them.\n}}

While she hopes Congress will act on some of these issues before the next session, she said that she didn\u2019t \u201chave a strong reason to believe\u201d that action would be taken.\n\u201cThere are all kinds of [policies] that just don\u2019t make sense and we haven\u2019t seen any action on them,\u201d she said.\nDavids, who was a white house fellow in the final year of the Obama Administration, graduated from Johnson County Community College and later the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\nDavids, who was last in Ithaca for her reunion weekend, will be returning to Cornell on March 23 to speak to the Women\u2019s Law Coalition on the importance of women \u201csupporting each other.\u201d The next day, she will speak at the Tribal Economic Summit on how to \u201c[navigate] tribal issues in the new administration.\u201d\n\u201cI bring a new perspective that was missing in this race.

{{Alas, writing for Vox while claiming to be a \u201cwonk\u201d or pundit doesn\u2019t mean you actually contribute meaningful and worthwhile things to the public discussion. Dylan Matthews is a self-absorbed blogger who, fortunately, has all the wisdom the Founding Fathers lacked and has studied the issues of history and constitutional government so deeply and broadly that he can making sweeping proclamations about the folly of such things as the Constitution and the American Revolution.\nWhile many of the statesmen who litigated these issues in august councils more than two centuries ago spoke Latin, Greek and perhaps one or two other languages besides English, be content that Matthews has earned the title of \u201cwonk\u201d because of his tweets. Further, while the men in wigs labored under the penalty of treason or actually gave up liberty and property, Matthews the millennial has suffered inscrutably for having his opinions taken seriously while he has done nothing to earn esteem.\nOn July 2, Matthews wrote a piece for Vox declaring, \u201cAmerican independence in 1776 was a monumental mistake. We should be mourning the fact that we left the United Kingdom, not cheering it.\u201d Proof of his claim may be found, he says, in the fate of African Americans, Native Americans and in his assertion that the Untied States would have a better form of government if it had stuck by Mother England for a bit longer.\n\u201cWhen a cause [colonial independence] is opposed by the two most vulnerable groups in a society [slaves, Indians], it\u2019s probably a bad idea,\u201d he writes. Matthews, a male, forgets the plight of women \u2013 who weren\u2019t universally afforded the franchise until 1920. He also forgets the plight of non-landowners, who were prohibited in some places from voting. As well, unmentioned in his cute counter-history, are those of various religious minorities who suffered persecution at the hand of governments in colonies (and then states) with established religious institutions.\nBottom line: It is cute to forget history, to oversimplify it, to ignore the grandeur of those things known as \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cdetails\u201d so you can write a controversial piece of click bait and get some web traffic for the digital rag that hosts your ego. However, it also perpetuates a false notion of history that degrades the public discourse at a time when it desperately needs to be raised.\nTo its credit \u2013 perhaps \u2013 Vox did publish a refutation of Matthews\u2019 nonsense about the evils of American independence in 1776. The writer makes valid points about the American Revolution being a starting point for better things and notes that racial minorities did play an important role in the nation\u2019s independence. He could have also mentioned that a free United States attracted millions of immigrants from the Old World who otherwise might not have come, and fostered a wonderful, if deeply imperfect, expansion of economic opportunity and moral development that allowed the nation to twice rescue Europe, and once Asia, from the murdering grasps of evil regimes.\nThis is not the first time Matthews has fancied himself to be a 20-something year-old expert with all the answers history is not looking for. He has built his \u201cwonk\u201d brand by making startling propositions with a serious face, pretending they are weighty ponderings.\nIn 2013, he claimed at The Washington Post that the government shutdown was \u201cJames Madison\u2019s fault.\u201d As he put it:\n\u201cThis week\u2019s shutdown is only the latest symptom of an underlying disease in our democracy whose origins lie in the Constitution and some supremely misguided ideas that made their way into it in 1787, and found their fullest exposition in Madison\u2019s Federalist no. 51.\u201d\nIn 2009, Matthews claimed, \u201cI want to get rid of the US [sic] Senate.\u201d He again made that goal clear this year, writing in January, \u201cThe problem is that the deck is stacked in favor of small states, which receive equal representation in the Senate despite dramatic variance in population. The Senate is a profoundly anti-democratic body and should be abolished.\u201d\nSomewhere James Madison muttered \u201cprecisely.\u201d In Federalist No. 62, Madison explained that the Senate was equally apportioned to the states and the House was apportioned based on population as part of a grand compromise. \u201cThe equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.\u201d\nOf course, since he despises Madison, Matthews may not have read his remarks on the topic. Not knowing it was a grand compromise means one doesn\u2019t have to offer an alternative compromise, and arguing that the nation shouldn\u2019t have existed in 1787 further removes the need to even recognize the dysfunction created by the insufficient Articles of Confederation.\nMatthews has also written favorably about the nullification of the Electoral College, going so far as to offer various pathways for the plan to become reality (it seems he just doesn\u2019t like states \u2013 which the Senate and electoral collage were designed to represent).\nMatthew\u2019s arrogance is hardly unique to him, or the only flaw at Vox. But it is indicative of a wider problem with young pundits and so-called wonks: people who have so far achieved nothing in life find it necessary to build their fame attacking the very institutions that have enabled their success. This isn\u2019t to say all young pundits are shallow; but a generation that feels it is the culmination of all that humanity has to offer, and feels justified to cast stones at all who preceded them, is too self-absorbed for its own good.\n}}

{{On Sunday night, Oct. 16, 2017, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reported that whistleblower and former DEA Agent Joe Rannazzisi confirmed what I first wrote about in a HuffPost piece, \u201cI Am A Heroin Addict,\u201d on Nov. 2, 2015. Big Pharma, specifically Purdue Pharma, is responsible for the current opioid epidemic.\nHowever, what Joe Rannazzisis added should shock us all. In fact, as a former heroin addict who beat a 10-bag-a-day habit, I hope this new information will be the final piece of the puzzle that turns this crisis on its heels.\n... the opioid crisis was allowed to spread \u2015 aided by Congress, lobbyists, and a drug distribution industry that shipped, almost unchecked, hundreds of millions of pills to rogue pharmacies and pain clinics providing the rocket fuel for a crisis that, over the last two decades, has claimed 200,000 lives.\nAlthough I am delighted the DEA whistleblower dared to speak up, it is beyond reason to think these facts took so long to rise to the surface.\nUnfortunately, the ability for Harvey Weinstein to skate free after decades of sexual abuse while all of Hollywood knew is tragically similar to why we didn\u2019t know the facts of the current opioid epidemic earlier. Bottom line: It was money, money and more that ultimately controlled what the public should know.\nIronically, the facts about Big Pharma being complicit go back to 2003 when New York Times reporter Barry Meier wrote, Pain Killer: A \u201cWonder\u201d Drug\u2019s Trail Of Addiction And Death. Meier\u2019s book first exposed Purdue Pharma as the knowing and willing culprit that put corporate greed above the public safety.\nThen, almost 13 years later, according to a May 2, 2016, Los Angeles Times investigative report:\nBig Pharma had created a massive legal opiate addiction, which directly led to the heroin epidemic because pharmaceutical corporations\u2019 own addiction to profit arguably trumps any concern it may have had for patients.\nMore specifically, when Purdue Pharma began marketing the chemical cousin of heroin in 2001, they recklessly convinced the then sitting FDA chief, Dr. Curtis Wright, that their new \u201cwonder drug\u201d OxyContin\u2019s 12-hour \u201csmooth and sustained\u201d dosing would substantially lower the addiction rate caused by legal opioid pain medication.\nBut their claim was not only tainted in that its duration was often hours less than promised, but Purdue knew that before the painkiller ever hit the market. Oh, and by the way, shortly after the FDA approved the 12-hour labeling of OxyContin, FDA chief Dr. Curtis Wright resigned and took a high-paying job with Purdue Pharma.\nOf course, Purdue Pharma, armed with a favorable label, embarked on a $200 million marketing campaign, touting its drug not just for cancer patients, but for muscle aches and injuries, for broken bones and for post-surgery pain, all set in stone according to the FDA.\nIronically, it was a government agency created to protect consumers that allowed a favorable labeling that translated to the deaths of thousands of young adults.\nIn Barry Meier\u2019s book Pain Killer: A \u201cWonder\u201d Drug\u2019s Tale of Addiction and Death, he wrote, \u201cNo other manufacturer of a Schedule II narcotic ever got the go-ahead from the FDA to make such a claim.\u201d\nIn fact, according to an analysis of nationwide prescription data conducted for the Los Angeles Times, \u201cMore than half of long-term OxyContin users were on doses that public health officials consider dangerously high.\u201c\nIn 2007, Purdue Pharma and three men \u2015 Michael Friedman, Purdue Pharma\u2019s chief executive; Howard Udell, its top lawyer; and Dr. Paul Goldenheim, chief medical officer \u2015 pled guilty to criminal charges that the company had misled doctors and patients.\nUnfortunately, the army of opioid addicts had already been trained and organized. The Mexican cartels saw the handwriting on the wall and cut the cost of a kilo of heroin in half.\nIn a New York minute, heroin filled America\u2019s streets at the remarkably cheap cost of $7-$10 a bag. Purdue had orchestrated an unquenchable market.\nIn 2015, the richest newcomer to the Forbes annual top-20 list of America\u2019s Richest Families entered in at a stunning $14 billion. The Sackler Family, owners of Purdue Pharma, built the 16th largest fortune by making the most popular opioid of the 21st century \u2014 OxyContin.\nToday, the opioid epidemic has become America\u2019s worst health crisis ever. Accidental drug overdoses killed more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS at its 1995 peak. Last year, opioid overdoses ended more people\u2019s lives than gun homicides and car crashes combined.\nI wanted to highlight just what Joe Rannazzisi told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\nThis is an industry that\u2019s out of control. What they wanna do is do what they wanna do and not worry about what the law is. And if they don\u2019t follow the law in drug supply, people die. That\u2019s just it. People die.\nThis is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs.\nBut will the Rannazzisi piece of the puzzle be enough to cement the deal? Will the facts of who is responsible for creating the worst health crisis in America\u2019s history finally cause President Trump and Congress to do something that will signal a significant blow to the direction the current epidemic is heading.\nI fear that if they do nothing. I fear if corporate greed is allowed to prosper, the new face of heroin will be the beautiful young babies we are holding today.\nRitchie Farrell is the author of I am a Heroin Addict.\n}}
{{The first Vietnamese-American elected to Congress took advantage of dissatisfaction with a longtime incumbent dogged by corruption allegations and reflects the changing nature of New Orleans politics since Hurricane Katrina.\nRepublican immigration attorney Anh \"Joseph\" Cao defeated Democratic U.S. William Jefferson on Saturday in an election postponed for a month by Hurricane Gustav.\nThe victory for a 41-year-old child of Vietnam War refugees was greeted with amazement and drew parallels to last year's election of Gov. Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American Republican.\n'Uncharted waters'\nIt also confirms a general shift to the GOP in Louisiana, where the Democratic Party dominated for generations and no Republican had represented New Orleans since 1890.\n\"This is kind of uncharted waters here,\" said Larry Powell, a Tulane University historian.\nCao was buoyed by low turnout, a lackluster campaign by Jefferson, strong third-party candidates and the election being postponed a month by Hurricane Gustav. State and national Republicans seized on the race with a well-funded and effective campaign, bombarding targeted neighborhoods with automated telephone calls, signs and flyers.\nJefferson faced some of the most direct attacks since 2005, when a wide-reaching corruption probe against him was made public and FBI agents found $90,000 in alleged bribe payments in his freezer. He currently faces trial on charges of money laundering, racketeering and bribery, but no date has been set.\nIn conceding the race, Jefferson blamed fatigue among his supporters.\n\"I think people just ran out of gas a bit,\" Jefferson said Saturday night. \"People today flat didn't come out in large numbers.\"\nImportant win for Asian communities\nIn many ways, Cao won on a protest vote by white voters from both major parties indignant about Jefferson's staying power. Analysts said white voters turned out by a ratio of 2-to-1 over blacks.\nNonetheless, Cao's win was viewed as improbable and important for the Asian communities of eastern New Orleans and the West Bank, a series of suburbs across the Mississippi River from the city.\n\"It's a David and Goliath story,\" said Joel Waltzer, a lawyer who's worked for 20 years representing Vietnamese homeowners and fishermen in eastern New Orleans. Before starting his own law practice, Cao worked for Waltzer.\nKatrina made Cao's win possible, Waltzer said.\n\"Before Katrina, they were an ignored constituency and now they are strong enough to elect their own congressman,\" Waltzer said. \"They've become ambitious. They want a voice in their own rebuilding, a place at the table when these very important decisions are made.\"\nGaining strength\nThe community \u2014 made up of war refugees from Southeast Asia who came here in the 1970s \u2014 has gained in strength since Katrina and it is widely viewed as a rebuilding model.\nRep. William Jefferson, shown here with his his wife, Dr. Andrea Green-Jefferson, had been re-elected in 2006 even after news of the scandal broke.\n\"They jumped onto it with nobody's help,\" said Pete Gerica, a commercial fisherman and industry advocate who lives near the Asian community, known generally as Village d'Est or Versailles.\n\"It's a self-contained city,\" Gerica said. \"They have steelworkers, carpenters, everything they need right there. They have shoe makers, they got people who make clothes. They are a very tight-knit family and that's what makes good people, when you put family first.\"\nCao (pronounced \"Gow\") is largely unknown, but his compelling life story attracted many voters. He was born in Vietnam and had to flee the country after Saigon fell in 1975 at age 8. His father, a South Vietnamese army officer, was imprisoned by Communist forces and later released.\nHe earned a degree in philosophy from Fordham University, a Jesuit college in New York City, and moved to Louisiana in 1992 as a seminarian. He earned his law degree from Loyola University in New Orleans.\nHe has personally experienced the destructive powers of hurricanes in the low-lying region. His home in an upscale suburb outside New Orleans' levee system was flooded by Katrina and Gustav.\nGerica said Cao could put a new face on Louisiana's reconstruction and, if he works with Democrats like Rep. Charlie Melancon, do good things for the state. But, he added, his lack of seniority and experience could be a detriment.\nCao has close ties with the powerful Vietnamese Catholic church, Mary Queen of Vietnam, and vowed that his political bid was motivated by his religiosity.\n\"It was something that I was called to do, literally, in the religion sense,\" Cao said.\nStaunch foe of abortion\nThe congressman-elect describes himself as a political moderate with only one firm policy belief: He is against abortion.\nAs a lawyer, he has worked for Boat People S.O.S., a national Vietnamese-American advocacy group for refugees. He became known in New Orleans in 2006 as a leader in an emotional campaign to close a new landfill for Katrina debris. In 2007, Cao ran for a state House seat as an independent and lost.\nHe said his win Saturday proved Louisiana is open-minded.\n\"The people of Louisiana are very special, very progressive,\" he said, \"and I think we will serve as a beacon for the rest of the country.\"\n}}
{{Gil Cisneros is running for Congress in California\u2019s 39th Congressional District, split between Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino Counties. Gil is a veteran. He doesn\u2019t take contributions from PACs because he believes that government should work for the people and not for corporate special interests. He attended collage on a Naval scholarship and holds a MBA from Regis University and a MA in Urban Education Policy from Brown. He was a manager for Frito-Lay and was laid off in 2010. Weeks after, he won a Mega Millions jackpot worth $266 million. We all dream of winning the lottery and then using the money to make the world a better place \u2013 Gil is living this dream. He and his wife became philanthropists. They established endowments for scholarships, they founded Generation First Degree Pico Rivera and The Gilbert & Jacki Cisneros Foundation. Gil has worked to strengthen public schools and created college opportunities for students and veterans. Today, he wants to represent his district in Washington. I wanted to see what he had to say to the Iranian American community.\nIrandokht: What has been your experience with the Iranian American Community? What are some of the challenges they have been brought to your attention?\nGil: The Iranian American community is highly educated, successful, and a part of what makes California the leader in many areas. I participated in a No Muslim Ban Forum and an Interfaith roundtable that included leaders from the Iranian community and their concerns are very similar to the concerns all of us have about the direction our country is heading.\nIrandokht: Why do you think Iranians were included in the Muslim travel ban but citizens from other countries that committed a terrorist act on American soil were not? Why not just ban specific people that are thought to be terrorists and not countries?\nGil: It\u2019s hard to rationalize anything the Trump administration does, especially on the topic of immigration. The Trump administration\u2019s travel ban does nothing to strengthen our border security, nor does it address any of the issues affecting our immigration system. The whole decision to implement a travel ban like this is against the spirit of this country and the values we have as a nation.\nIrandokht: What went through your mind when you saw the children being separated from their parents? In court without their parents? In cages? From my understanding, there are still children that have not been reunited with their parents. What is your game plan for helping these children?\nGil: I can never forget the images and stories of children locked in metal cages and crying out for their parents. This has shocked our country\u2019s moral conscience. The Trump administration\u2019s \u2018zero-tolerance\u2019 immigration policy is cruel, inhumane, and goes against everything our country should stand for. Instead of providing compassion and hope, the administration is stoking fear and anguish, inducing more trauma in families who are fleeing violence and persecution. When I and the thousands of our country\u2019s veterans enlisted to serve our nation, these were not values that we chose to defend. The fact that children are still separated from their parents is inexcusable. These children must be joined with their families at once.\nI visited the border at Tornillo, Texas because I believe we must continue to speak out against the cruel and inhumane treatment of families at our border. I\u2019m continuing to call for the immediate reunification of children and parents and for comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together. I will support legislation that expedites this effort through funding attorney\u2019s and social workers who have the language skills to connect with these kids and parents.\nIrandokht: The gun violence in this country seems to be getting worse and not better. How are you going to help us keep guns out of our schools, movie theaters, etc.?\nGil: I lost my grandfather to an act of gun violence. It\u2019s something that has affected my family to this day. I am sure that I\u2019m not the only person that was deeply troubled by the act of domestic terrorism in San Bernardino. I am sure that I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s inspired by the Parkland students courage to fight for gun control. It\u2019s time for our legislature to lead by their example and prevent another San Bernardino attack, a Sandy Hook shooting, the Las Vegas massacre and now the killing of people in a Synagogue. We need comprehensive gun legislation. That includes universal background checks, regulating military-style assault weapons, and repealing the Dickey Amendment. Arming our teachers and administrators and putting guns in schools is not an acceptable solution.\nIrandokht: Why do you think both democrats and republicans connect with your message?\nGil: I am speaking to our values here in the 39th District because I\u2019ve listened to the issues most prominent in their lives. Often times I\u2019ve shared in similar experiences. I know what it\u2019s like to watch a loved one live without healthcare because my mom didn\u2019t have it for 16 years. I know what it\u2019s like to welcome a person home from war and later struggle with mental illness. I know how hard it is to pay for college and the hoops a young person has to jump through to make higher education happen for them. I\u2019ve witnessed the incredible work ethic of immigrant families, who are being dismissed today by an Administration that doesn\u2019t want them here. The issues on the 39th district community\u2019s minds are the same issues I struggle with every day. That is why I want to head to Washington and represent them in Congress.\nIrandokht: What do you think about Universal Healthcare? And pre-existing conditions?\nGil: I strongly believe that healthcare is a right, not a privilege. We must work to restore and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. We need to restore the individual mandate, ensure protections for pre-existing conditions, restore the public option, restore risk corridors, and allow the government to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the costs of prescription drugs. Those with pre-existing conditions must have access to the life-saving care they need. We also need to make sure patient safety is a priority in every hospital.\nIrandokht: What is your stance on immigration and the DREAMERS?\nGil: For over eight years my wife and I have dedicated ourselves to our foundation that supports and motivates students to enter college, and a large portion of the students we have supported have been Latinx/Hispanic girls and boys who are first generation Americans and college students. It has always been important to me to support kids who felt they didn\u2019t have a chance to achieve their dream. We also have worked to support many students who identify as DREAMers. Equality is necessary not only by ethnicity but in accessibility. In Congress, I\u2019ll fight to ensure we never rip apart families. I\u2019ll advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that upholds our promise to DREAMers, provides a pathway to citizenship, and doesn\u2019t fund the President\u2019s senseless border wall.\nIrandokht: I\u2019ve heard over and over again that people are very disappointed in the Democratic Party and believe they have been too weak to put country over party. How would you respond to that?\nGil: The democratic party is strong because of its diversity of people, ideology and background. The party is working to expand and adapt to the changing society around them. We\u2019ve done it before and we will do it again. I firmly believe this party is the one fighting for working families, the LGBTQ community, women, people of color, immigrants, those with disabilities, and so many other demographics. We are representative of the society we live in, and so long as we are open to listening to the various facets of that society, we can be a place where every can feel represented.\nIrandokht: Where do you stand on LGBTQ rights? Women\u2019s rights? Veterans?\nGil: I believe you should be able to marry who you love, express your true identity without fear, make your own choices about what happens to your body and feel safe in your community- whether it\u2019s at the ballot box or walking to the grocery store.\nI\u2019ve seen the sacrifices and challenges that veterans have faced overseas and in coming home. As a former Naval officer who entered military service in the tradition of my father and grandfathers, I\u2019ll be a strong voice for military families and veterans. I\u2019ve spoken with veterans who have struggling to be able to afford their education and housing. We need to be giving veterans the benefits they have earned, not cutting their funding.\nIrandokht: How do you plan on making higher education affordable?\nGil: Making higher education affordable and accessible starts at a young age. In Congress, I will fight to increase investments in our k-12 education system. I will fight to ensure a quality education is accessible wherever you live and regardless of income. We also need to better support our teachers who are overworked and underpaid. We need to allow borrowers\nwith high-interest private student loans to refinance at lower rates. Helping our students refinance their loans provides them with the opportunity to pursue their dreams without falling into economic hardship. We need to bring Pell grants in line with the actual cost of higher education. We can provide states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education and provide students with debt-free college. We also need to invest more in community college colleges and vocational programs. These are great alternatives to a four year school or could be a jumping off point for those who want to later attend a university or four year college.\nIrandokht: I noticed \u201cAnimal Rights\u201d on your list of priorities \u2013 can you expand on this?\nGil: Promoting animal welfare and protecting them from abuse is a top priority for me. I understand the important role animals play in the lives of adults and children. I will fight to protect farm animals from inhumane treatment and work to eliminate the use of antibiotics in farm animals for non-therapeutic reasons. In Congress, I will vote to protect pets and domesticated animals by strengthening regulations on \u201cpuppy mills\u201d and other harmful commercial breeding facilities and support legislation to prevent animal cruelty and torture.\nIrandokht: What is your message to Iranian Americans that shy away from getting involved in politics and don\u2019t vote because they feel their vote doesn\u2019t make a difference?\nGil: The right to vote is an honor. It is an important way to make your voice heard and to elect people who will represent you and your values from local governments to the White House. Just a few votes can determine who sits on your school boards, city council and in courtrooms. Voting is more than just Congress and the Presidency. It is critical in determining what happens in your own backyard.\n***\nFor more information about Gil, his campaign or to volunteer or donate, please visit CisnerosforCongress.com can also follow him on Twitter @GilCisnerosCA and Facebook\n}}
{{Since announcing the nuclear weapons deal with Iran, we\u2019ve documented numerous instances where Obama blatantly and callously lied about the substance of the deal in communications to Congress and the American people (see, for instance, here|here|here).\nIn the past three days other developments have taken place that demonstrate the extent to which Obama has lied about what the deal says.\nThe Iranian Defense Minister has said that the agreement does not allow inspection of nuclear facilities on military installations.\nIran\u2019s Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan categorically rejected as a \u201clie\u201d a Guardian report alleging that Tehran has granted access to its military facilities under the recent framework agreement with the world powers.\n\u201cNo such agreement has been made; principally speaking, visit to military centers is among our redlines and no such visit will be accepted,\u201d Gen. Dehqan stressed on Wednesday, rejecting \u201cthe report by foreign media outlets, such as the Guardian\u201d as \u201cuntruthful allegations\u201d. Trending After Covington and Smollett We Owe Ourselves a Victory Dance In the End Zone streiff\nThis calls into question exactly which facilities will be inspected and how undeclared facilities will be uncovered. It is worth keeping in mind that this has been Iran\u2019s position from the beginning.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini has said that Obama\u2019s fact sheet is not what Iran agreed to:\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday he neither backed nor rejected an interim accord with six world powers on Tehran\u2019s disputed nuclear program but demanded all sanctions be lifted immediately once a final agreement was concluded. He added in a televised speech that the details of the accord would be decisive, and the publication of a US fact sheet showing terms that were at variance with the Iranian view of the agreement showed \u201cdevilish\u201d US intentions. \u201cI neither support nor oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is in the details; it may be that the deceptive other side wants to restrict us in the details.\u201d\nAnd now the White House has admitted that it has embellished the terms of the agreement:\nAmerican officials acknowledge that they did not inform the Iranians in advance of all the \u201cparameters\u201d the United States would make public in an effort to lock in progress made so far, as well as to strengthen the White House\u2019s case against any move by members of Congress to impose more sanctions against Iran. \u201cWe talked to them and told them that we would have to say some things,\u201d said a senior administration official who could not be identified under the protocol for briefing reporters. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show them the paper. We didn\u2019t show them the whole list.\u201d\nThis is stunning in its duplicity. Not only is Obama keeping Congress in the dark about the negotiations but it is deliberately lying to Congress as it pushes to finalize the agreement.\n}}
{{By Charles Hudson\nMartin Yellow Eagle Cross sits cross-legged in the front row of the old photo, with an inconvenienced stare back into the camera. Light-hearted family lore has it that my grandfather was simply trying to show off a new pair of boots.\nIt was 1944 and leaders of American Indian tribes had gathered in Denver to form what is now known as the National Congress of American Indians.\nHe, like many of the tribal leaders, had returned from military service only to find their country preparing to vanquish them through federal policies of termination, massive dam-building and relocation programs. Oregon tribes bore the brunt of the termination era with six of the nine tribes terminated in the early 1950s. These policies came at a great social cost. The \"Burnside Boys,\" the destitute, dislocated tribal people trying to survive on the streets of Portland, joined the cruel lexicon of Indian identity.\nTribal leaders and Portland can be forgiven if they don't recognize one another when the National Congress formally convenes this week in Portland for its 68th annual convention, the first Rose City visit in more than 30 years. There are few remnants of the Burnside Boys as the tribes of Oregon have been restored from termination and can offer relatively robust opportunity to their people.\nDynamic native service organizations like the Native American Rehabilitation Association and the Native American Youth and Family Center offer a wide array of services and help families reconnect with traditional support systems.\nThe gaze of tribes is turning increasingly outward as healing occurs. A new generation of tribal citizenry, educated, wired, globally savvy, is changing the insular nature of tribal politics. My work on tribal natural resources and the \"Great Tribal Leaders of Modern Times\" project has shown me that effective tribal leadership bears distinctive hallmarks:\nIt's accountable, surrounded by good people, and involves decision-making based upon good information -- less of an Ivy League business model than traditional tribal leadership practice.\nThis week tribal leaders from many of the nation's 565 federally recognized tribes will confront many of the long-standing issues facing the tribes including poverty and health. But in a sign of changing times and circumstances, they will also debate digital telecommunications, energy development and \"lean thinking\" in this era of budget tightening.\nTen years after the 1944 Congress, Martin Cross and his people of the Fort Berthold reservation in North Dakota would have their land and society ripped apart by the construction of the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River. A few years after that, he would be dead of a broken heart and slow suicide in a lonely house on the prairie.\nBut Martin's death, like so many others of his generation, would not be in vain. A new generation of leaders was inspired by those in 1944, committed to fight the heavy gravity of victimhood and replace it with self-determination.\nThe late Wilma Mankiller, iconic 20th century leader of the Cherokee Nation, put it succinctly: \"You can't see the future with tears in your eyes.\"\nCharles Hudson is director of government affairs for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.\n}}
{{LOS ANGELES \u2014 A small crowd that gathered Thursday outside the Los Angeles office of U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters to counter an expected protest by a self-styled militia group burned an American flag taken from the back of a pickup truck.\nThe incident happened after the far-right Oath Keepers group didn\u2019t appear at the office after saying it would rally against the congresswoman.\nA group of counter-protesters there to support Waters were chanting \u201cblack power\u201d and other slogans when the pickup approached.\nThe vehicle, occupied by two men who appeared to be white, was stopped by the crowd. Some marchers opened the doors and one grabbed the flag flying on a pole in the bed of the truck, which sped off.\nThe flag was stepped on and lit on fire as someone stoked the flames.

{{A special conference of all national and central Jewish organizations has been called by the American Jewish Congress to consider action on the report on Palestine issued by the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. The conference will take place Tuesday evening, April 15, at the Hotel Astor. A telegram inviting the participation of all representative Jewish groups in American Jewry and calling attention to the grave situation precipitated by the unjust findings of the majority report of the Commission was yesterday sent out by the American Jewish Congress.\nThe announcement recalls that the American Jewish Congress played a leading role in the events which led up to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration in November of 1917; that the American Jewish Congress in December of 1918, at its session in Philadelphia, was the first representative Jewish body to advance the idea of England\u2019s assuming the Mandatory over Palestine; and that the representatives of its delegates at the Peace Conference were in a measure responsible for the acceptance of the historic right of the Jews to Palestine by the governments of the world and by world public opinion.\nIt is indicated that the Jewish hopes of a national renaissance in Palestine are now jeopardized by the findings of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. It will be the function of the conference next Tuesday to formulate some plan of action whereby Great Britain may be persuaded to acknowledge the injustice of making the Commission\u2019s findings the basis of its future policy in Palestine. Arrangements for the conference were made yesterday following a meeting of officers of the American Jewish Congress with other representatives of Jewish public opinion.\n}}
{{WASHINGTON \u2014 Black farmers, due $1.2 billion for a legacy of discrimination by the Agriculture Department, suffered a new and disheartening setback this week, despite the national spotlight provided by the quickly disavowed firing of a black department worker.\nThe Senate refused again to pay the bill.\nOpponents say it is a question of where the money would come from, and that is a major issue with an election nearing and voters up in arms about federal spending.\nLate Thursday, the Senate stripped $1.2 billion for the claims from an emergency-spending bill, along with $3.4 billion in long-overdue funding for a settlement with American Indians who say they were swindled out of royalties by the federal government.\nEven the attention the Shirley Sherrod case brought to the issue of discrimination at the Agriculture Department couldn\u2019t bring lawmakers together on a deal. Instead, Republicans and Democrats alike proclaimed their support for the funding, appeasing important constituencies, while blaming the other side for not getting anything done.\nThe result: Thousands of black farmers and Indian landowners will keep waiting for checks that most lawmakers agree should have been written years ago.\n\u201cIf you say you support us, then . . . do it!\u201d said John Boyd, a Virginia farmer and the lead organizer for the black farmers\u2019 lawsuits.\nSherrod\u2019s resignation under pressure from the Agriculture Department over her comments about race, and the subsequent White House apology, brought fresh attention to the black farmers\u2019 claims. In explaining why he acted so hastily in asking her to resign, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he and the department were keenly sensitive to the issue of discrimination and race given the agency\u2019s dismal track record on civil rights.\nIt\u2019s a record that Vilsack routinely describes as \u201csordid.\u201d For decades, minority farmers have complained of being shut out by local Agriculture offices, well after the days of blatant segregation.\nSherrod herself was a claimant in a case against the department. She had been part of a cooperative that won a $13 million settlement just last year.\nLeaders in both parties in Congress say they support the funding, which the House passed this month, but things break down when they try to hash out how to pay. Senate Republicans insist they be paid for rather than adding them to the federal deficit.\n}}
{{Fifty-year career wins over jury for 'chanelling the US's myriad voices' in novels such as Ragtime and Billy Bathgate\nAmerica's \"very own Charles Dickens\", EL Doctorow, is set to be honoured with the Library of Congress prize for American fiction this summer.\nDoctorow, whose career spans 50 years and whose acclaimed novels include Ragtime, Billy Bathgate and World's Fair, said that winning the award would help to \u2013 momentarily \u2013 soothe his \"self-doubt\".\n\"I was a child who read everything I could get my hands on. Eventually, I asked of a story not only what was to happen next, but how is this done? How am I made to live from words on a page? And so I became a writer myself,\" said the author. \"But is there a novelist who doesn't live with self-doubt? The high honour of the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction confers a blessed moment of peace and resolution.\"\nEstablished to mark the career of an American writer whose work \"is distinguished not only for its mastery of the art but for its originality of thought and imagination\", the prize has previously gone to Don DeLillo, and in its previous format as the Library of Congress Creative Achievement award for fiction to John Grisham, Isabel Allende, Toni Morrison and Philip Roth.\nAnnouncing that the judging panel of authors and critics had decided on Doctorow as this year's winner, librarian of congress James Billington described the author as \"our very own Charles Dickens, summoning a distinctly American place and time, channelling our myriad voices\".\n\"Each book is a vivid canvas, filled with colour and drama. In each, he chronicles an entirely different world,\" said Billington.\nDoctorow told the New York Times that his focus on American history was \"not a conscious decision, but somewhere along the line I must have realised a slice of time was as valid an organising principle for a novel as a bit of acreage\".\n\"The great Faulkner might have Yoknapatawpha County but I could have the first decade of the 20th century,\" he said, referring to Ragtime.\nThe prize, which specifically seeks to reward \"strong, unique, enduring voices that \u2013 throughout long, consistently accomplished careers \u2013 have told us something about the American experience\", will be given to Doctorow on 30 August at the Library of Congress National Book festival.\nDoctorow's prize will join his previous awards, including the National Book Award for fiction, the National Book Critics Circle award for fiction and the PEN/Faulkner award.\n}}

{{Story Highlights Top priorities remain healthcare, education and the economy\nMajority sees income distribution as extremely/very important\nThree in four view drug abuse as extremely/very important\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- As a new Congress takes office Thursday amid a partial government shutdown, most Americans see quite a few key issues as important for Congress and the White House to tackle this year. While education, healthcare and the economy once again rank as their top three priorities, majorities of U.S. adults also desire to see leaders tackle a host of pressing issues such as immigration, gun policy, the nation's infrastructure and the distribution of income and wealth across the nation.\nAmericans' Priorities for the President and Congress to Tackle in 2019 Next, how important is it to you that the president and Congress deal with each of the following issues in the next year -- is it -- extremely important, very important, moderately important or not that important? How about \u2026 ? Extremely/Very important % Education 87 Healthcare policy 85 The economy 85 Social Security 80 The federal budget deficit 76 Immigration 75 Drug abuse 75 The nation's infrastructure 72 U.S. trade and tariff policies 71 Gun policy 66 Climate change 62 The distribution of income and wealth 62 (sorted by \"extremely/very important\") GALLUP, Dec 3-12, 2018\nWhile most of the priorities remained stable, those saying education is extremely important was up (42%) compared with the last time the question was asked in 2014 (26%). However, one noticeable shift took place at the very bottom of the priority list -- the issue of income and wealth distribution.\nAs low unemployment has been coupled with slow wage growth, income inequality has gained importance among Americans. Sixty-two percent of Americans say it is either very or extremely important that the president and Congress deal with the issue of distribution of income and wealth within the country, up from Gallup's last measure of 57% in 2014.\nAlthough it ranked lower than traditional issues, such as dealing with the federal budget deficit and immigration, the majority of Americans who see income distribution as important for leaders to deal with reflects how it has become a major issue of focus not only in the United States, but also other developed economies.\nOn a related note, Gallup recently found that rising numbers of Americans view socialism positively and associate it with some form of greater equality. Americans' increasing embrace of socialism, coupled with the fact that a majority view the issue of income distribution as important for national leaders, could mean a greater focus on such issues as the presidential campaign season begins its long march to 2020.\nDrug Abuse\nThree out of every four Americans view drug abuse as either an extremely or very important issue for the new Congress and the president to address this year. While this was the first time Gallup offered drug abuse as an answer choice, it's no surprise that 75% would cite this issue as important, with more than 100 daily deaths across the country related to opioid overdoses alone, as well as a rise in national overdose deaths in general. Recent research has shown it has also contributed to Americans' lower life expectancy.\nJust a few months earlier, three in 10 Americans told Gallup that drug abuse had caused trouble in their family, a perception that has seen a steady increase since the mid-1990s. Slightly more Americans (37%) cite alcohol abuse as a cause of trouble in their family than cite drug abuse.\nBottom Line\nDespite the partisan contentions that many expect to define the working relationship between the incoming Congress and the Donald Trump White House amid a partial government shutdown, Americans are clear on what they want to see their leaders tackle in 2019.\nWith education, healthcare and the economy topping priorities as they have for the past several years, more specific concerns about drug abuse and the distribution of income and wealth also garnered widespread importance in the minds of most Americans. A majority of Americans also express a strong appetite for leadership to take action on issues such as the federal budget deficit and immigration.\nThere is a lot of common ground on the issues Americans want to see their leaders prioritize; a failure to effectively tackle those issues will likely continue to be reflected in low approval ratings for Congress.\nView complete question responses and trends.\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n}}

{{Predictably, recent celebrations of the anniversary of the War on Poverty, votes to extend unemployment insurance, discussions of a minimum wage hike, and deliberation over cuts to SNAP (food stamps) have all fallen along familiar partisan fault lines. But voters' worries about--and personal experiences with--poverty and income inequality are more bipartisan than not.\nCongress To America: You're Poor? Your Fault\nListening to some Republican leaders, you hear what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error. Time after time, Republicans say poverty comes from peoples' bad decisions, rather than tough circumstances. Voters know better.\nReps. Gohmert and Bachmann, and Senator Marco Rubio have all come out recently to pin poverty on mothers' behavior. Gohmert dusted off the old \"mom of 15 children\" trope. Rubio selectively used data from female-headed household, and ignoring other research altogether. Bachmann uses the familiar code words about the \"importance of the family and the work ethic.\" Rep. Steve Southerland--Republicans' lead anti-SNAP crusader, has blamed the program for \"draining\" people's ambitions to work (even though most SNAP recipients work). Rep. Fincher also justified SNAP cuts by claiming the Bible prefers people to starve (though he himself receives millions in farm subsidies).\nVoters, thankfully, are more sympathetic. According to a recent report by the Center for American Progress (CAP), voters consistently believe the poor are facing a tough economy, rather than personal failings. And while there are some differences, white conservatives and libertarians are in agreement.\nHowever, there is still some worry about a culture of dependency. Over half (56%) of voters (and three-fourths of white conservatives/libertarians) say \"Too many poor people would rather live off government benefits than work to lift themselves off of poverty\" (emphasis mine). But this may not be inconsistent with believing most living in poverty are unfairly criticized or are decent people. \"Too many\" is subjective and can mean \"any\" to respondents, while \"most\" is clearly a majority.\nAmericans Feel the Pain of Poverty & Income Inequality\nThese concerns about the poor reflect both an increase in Americans feeling touched by poverty personally, and more worries about income inequality. The CAP survey shows a majority (54%) of Americans say they have a close family member who is poor, more than even during the 2008 peak of the economic crisis. And the average estimate of the number of Americans in poverty (39%) is far more than the reality (15%) and is a 10-point jump since 2008 (when the reality was 13%).\nGiven both experiences and perceptions of widespread poverty, majorities across party lines are dissatisfied with the distribution of wealth. According to Gallup, two-thirds of adults (including 54% of Republicans) are dissatisfied \"with the way wealth and income are distributed.\" Pew has shown more feel the income gap has widened over the last decade.\nTaken all together, this leaves Americans more pessimistic about what was once a top American source of pride: the potential for upward mobility. Gallup also shows continued increase in dissatisfaction with the opportunity for people \"to get ahead by working hard.\" And here there is no party difference at all: 61% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats are dissatisfied.\n}}
{{Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin, American Samoa's former long-serving representative to the United States Congress, has died in Utah, aged 73.\nPhoto: AFP\nHis death was confirmed by his sister-in-law, Theresa Hunkin, who said he died peacefully at his home in Provo, surrounded by family and a few close friends.\nBorn in Vailoatai Village in American Samoa, Faleomavaega grew up in Hawaii, where he went on to study a Bachelor's degree in political science, before studying law on the United States mainland.\nHe then joined the United States Army, where he fought in the Vietnam War, eventually rising to the rank of captain. While in Vietnam, he said was exposed to the toxic defoliant, Agent Orange, which he claimed had contributed to health issues he experienced later in life.\nAfter leaving the army in 1969, Faleomavaega served as the administrative assistant to American Samoa's delegate to Washington before returning to the islands of his birth in 1981, where he briefly became the territory's attorney-general before deciding to pursue a career in politics.\nHe was elected the territory's lieutenant governor in 1985, under the governorship of Aifili Paulo Lutali, before running for the territory's sole seat in Washington in 1988. Running on the Democratic Party ticket, he narrowly won that election against independent Lia Tufele with 51 percent of the vote.\nBut once he reached Washington, he became an established leader who went on to grow his support and hold the seat until his ouster by Aumua Amata in 2014.\nRNZ International's correspondent in American Samoa's capital Pago Pago, Fili Sagapolutele, said that with 26 years in congress, Faleomavaega was a hugely popular leader, who won elections with large majorities.\n\"He was a strong leader,\" she said. \"Not just as a political leader, but with the Fa'a Samoa (the Samoan way) because he holds that chiefly title, and despite the fact that he's in Washington most of the time he still was able to speak that Samoan language in fluently addressing in the cultural way and speak from one traditional leader to another. He had a lot of respect.\"\nAmerican Samoa is the only territory of the United States where its people are considered residents, not citizens. But, like other territories, American Samoans are also unable to vote for president and its sole representative in Congress is unable to vote on legislation.\nThat limited his efficiency and ability to get things done in Congress, but Ms Sagapolutele said that only made him more committed to the fight. In his 26 years in Washington, Faleomavaega served as a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Natural Resources, which have jurisdiction over the US territories.\nIn terms of legislation, Faleomavaega successfully pushed for more funding for the territory - particularly for roads, schools and other infrastructure - and opposed deals that would have threatened American Samoa's tuna industry.\nHe also fought, unsuccessfully, for greater rights for American Samoa. In Congress, he proposed legislation that would have allowed residents of territories to vote in presidential elections if they were active members of the military, and, towards the end of his tenure, for the people of American Samoa to consider a push towards greater autonomy, if not independence from the United States.\nFaleomavaega also became somewhat of a representative for the other countries of the Pacific in Washington, Ms Sagapolutele said. During his tenure he spoke on issues such as climate change, the West Papua independence movement, and other issues affecting the region.\n\"One big example was in 1996 when he boycotted an address by the French president at the time before Congress due to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific,\" she said.\nHowever, as health problems began to present themselves in the early 2010s, Faleomavaega's popularity began to wane. In 2014, he was ousted by the current congresswoman Aumua Amata. In an interview with KHJ News at the time, he said his loss had come as a surprise, and that despite the result, he had no intention to retire from politics.\nAt his farewell speech in Washington, he said he never expected the people of American Samoa to support him for so long: \"I go forward ... knowing that the best is yet to come and hoping I will be remembered for trying my best. For the times I fell short I ask for forgiveness. And to each of my colleagues, and to you, Mr Speaker, I extend my kindest and highest regard.\"\nMs Sagapolutele said Faleomavaega's health had been a concern in recent years, with a couple of high profile medical evacuations to Hawaii which he had attributed to Agent Orange poisoning. She said that despite promising to stay involved in politics, he had been relatively low profile since 2015, apparently writing a book.\nMs Sagapolutele said funeral arrangements were yet to be announced, including whether Faleomavaega's body would be returned to American Samoa for burial. The territory's governor, Lolo Matalasi Moliga, and Ms Aumata were expected to release statements in the coming day.\nFaleomavaega Eni Hunkin is survived by his wife, Hinanui, five children, and 10 grandchildren.\n}}
{{Last night, the House finally approved what is known as the \u201cAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act\u201d \u2014 a curious name for a bill that effectively raises taxes on most Americans in a pretty substantial way.\nThe Tax Policy Center has the numbers: Thanks mostly to the expiration of the payroll-tax cut, taxes are going up on 77 percent of Americans relative to what they paid in 2012, with the mean increase amounting to $1,635. (Just 0.1 percent of Americans are getting a tax cut relative to their 2012 taxes, and almost all of them are in the top 5 percent of the income distribution \u2014 that gilded group that earns income above the Social Security wage base, but doesn\u2019t earn over $450,000 and therefore won\u2019t face higher rates on the top end, either). Here\u2019s the breakdown of who\u2019s seeing how much of a tax increase, by quintiles:\nVia Matt Yglesias, Credit Suisse has a slightly clearer illustration of how Americans\u2019 incomes will be affected this year:\nEssentially all of these tax increases result from the fact that the payroll-tax cut expires this year, increasing almost every employee\u2019s Social Security tax rate from 4.2 percent to 6.2 percent. I had an NRO piece about this on Monday, and there are two crucial points: That policy change itself is a regressive tax increase (since earnings above about $100,000 aren\u2019t subject to it), and it\u2019s predicted to shave about half a percentage point off of economic growth this year.\nFurther, as I explained:\nThroughout budget negotiations, the president has called for a balanced approach, by which he usually means tax increases on the rich commensurate with the spending cuts Republicans would like. But under his plan, in 2013, about half of the tax increases will fall on the rich (the 1 percent or the 2 percent, depending on what deal is struck), and about half of the extra revenue will come from increased payroll taxes \u2014 that is, from the incomes of 100 percent of Americans, and disproportionately from the poor and the middle class.\nThe TPC now has the numbers to back that up: Thirty-five percent of the additional revenue raised in 2013, combining the tax increases on the rich with the payroll-tax increase, will come from the bottom 80 percent of Americans, who make about 50 percent of the income in the U.S. Just over half the revenue will come from Americans making under $200,000 per year, the bottom 95 percent:\nAt no point throughout the negotiations for the deal we reached did the White House or congressional Republicans suggest that they would like to see the tax cut extended for a year, despite the fact that the former knows it was effective Keynesian stimulus and the latter has made an economic philosophy out of prizing tax cuts. Put another way: Republicans made their priority preventing tax increases on these people, while President Obama and Democrats were eager to increase taxes on these people \u2014 and neither did anything about the fact that taxes went up on these people.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThanks to our politicians\u2019 fecklessness, taxes are going up on most Americans to support an accounting fiction (the Social Security trust fund), slightly narrowing a deficit that doesn\u2019t need to be and won\u2019t be closed in the next year or two, when the U.S. economy is still stumbling along and Americans\u2019 pre-tax paychecks are stagnating. The one-year extension (and maybe phase-out in 2014 if solid growth returned toward the end of this year) we needed? Corporate America got that for its prized accelerated-depreciation bonus.\nA final point about the deal, and the suggestion that it \u201cexpands the deficit\u201d: Technically, at 12 a.m. on January 1, all of the Bush tax cuts expired, and therefore, the bill the House and the Senate just passed was a huge tax cut relative to \u201ccurrent law,\u201d and essentially, \u201ccurrent policy,\u201d too (though for whatever reason, the Tax Policy Center\u2019s assessment seems to assume \u201dcurrent policy\u201d is 2012\u2019s tax rates). Since, yes, tax cuts reduce revenue, that\u2019s the source of the CBO\u2019s statement that the fiscal-cliff deal massively increases the deficit \u2014 by about $3.6 trillion over the next ten years. That increase in the deficit is entirely due to forgone tax revenue which almost everyone in Congress agreed shouldn\u2019t be collected (there\u2019s also, though, $30 billion over two years in unemployment-benefits extensions, a real spending increase, and the meaningless spending increase associated with the doc fix, essentially the spending version of the tax hikes that were never going to happen). The deal only increases the deficit inasmuch as it doesn\u2019t raise taxes a spectacular amount \u2014 not exactly the kind of deficit expansion conservatives should spend much time complaining about.\nAdvertisement\nUPDATE: This post has been amended to fix a mistake of mine in the pie chart, which originally overstated the share of 2013\u2032s tax increases that will be borne by the middle class; I was using a TPC table with the wrong baseline.\n}}

Bonnie!\" as former Mercer County Sheriff Gil Lugossy announced the results, welcoming Watson Coleman on stage along with her family, Holt and other Mercer County Democratic officials.\n\u201cThis is not going to be an easy journey and we\u2019re going to have some very tough times. But see, we\u2019re made for these tough times,\u201d Watson Coleman said. \u201cWe need to make sure we go to Washington collectively, that your spirit goes there with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the prospect of going to Washington and becoming part of the discussion and, I hope, the solutions. You can count on me as I was able to count on you,\u201d she said.\nHolt, who has yet to state his plans after leaving Congress, said the district was \u201cblessed\u201d to have a \u201cnew and outstanding member of Congress\u201d in Watson Coleman.\n\u201cI told you in June the voters of the 12th Congressional District would really like this choice, and we see tonight they really like Bonnie Watson Coleman,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey see this is somebody who really cares about them and has the wisdom and intelligence to do things that will help them.\u201d\n\u201cShe gets it. She\u2019s not going to let up. This is somebody there to serve you and the other 750,000 people in central New Jersey, in the 12th Congressional District,\u201d he said.\nEck, who was at Middlesex County Republicans\u2019 headquarters in Edison, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAt the Wyndham, many of the Democrats who endorsed and campaigned for Watson Coleman \u2014 first elected to the Assembly in 1998, later serving as both majority leader and chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic Committee \u2014 lauded her victory.\n\u201cRight here in Trenton, we have the first African-American member of Congress from New Jersey, our friend Bonnie Watson Coleman,\u201d said Mercer County Executive Brian Hughes, one of the first to endorse Watson Coleman after she announced her candidacy in February.\n\u201cBonnie\u2019s place is in the house. We know \u2013 I know firsthand \u2013 that she is prepared, she is equipped and she learned right here in Trenton, when she learned to stand up to the Statehouse bully,\u201d said state Sen. Shirley Turner (D-Mercer), Watson Coleman\u2019s colleague in the 15th Legislative District. \u201cNow, she\u2019s going to stand up to (Speaker) John Boehner in the House of Representatives.\u201d\nIt was a tight nine-month election process for Watson Coleman, who was one of the first candidates to announce her candidacy for Holt\u2019s seat after he announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek reelection.\nWhat seemed like a tough primary contest, facing competition from state Sen. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex), Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula (D-Somerset) and South Brunswick resident Andrew Zwicker was decided in a landslide, with Watson Coleman winning her party\u2019s nomination with more than 15,600 votes.\nSince then, Watson Coleman and Eck remained as far apart on the issues as two candidates can be. Where Eck has called for a complete overhaul of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, Watson Coleman has instead focused on making improvements to its sign up process.\nAnd where Watson Coleman has called for more funding toward public schools, Eck has remained a staunch supporter of school choice programs.\n\u201cWe need to make sure we speak on behalf of everyday working families, on behalf of the elderly to make sure we protect Social Security and Medicare,\u201d Watson Coleman said. \u201cWe speak on behalf of children to make sure public education is the great equalizer and we speak on behalf of women and minorities and everybody not paid equal pay for equal work.\n\u201cAnd we will make sure that we stand up for the battles we thought we already won, like a woman\u2019s right to choose and unfettered access to voting,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou blessed me tonight, you\u2019ve blessed me since February and I pray my service is a blessing to you and your families.\u201d\nAfter the election results are certified, Watson Coleman is expected to resign her Assembly post anytime before Jan. 3, when she will be sworn into the 114th U.S. Congress.\nFrom the time the vacancy occurs, the Mercer County and Hunterdon County Democratic Committees will have 35 days to hold a joint convention to name a replacement, who will serve the remainder of Watson Coleman\u2019s term, which lasts through 2015.\nEditor's note: Vote tallies in this article have been updated.\nMike Davis may be reached at mdavis@njtimes.com.

{{The 2018 midterms have seen a record-breaking number of women launch campaigns for Congress. More than half of Americans are happy to see the uptick in female candidates, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\nThe poll, released Tuesday, found that 61 percent of Americans believe it\u2019s good that more women are running for U.S. Congress this year than in previous elections. Five percent reported the increase as bad, while 33 percent were neutral.\nThough women make up half of the population, they currently comprise just 20 percent of Congress. But amid a surge in activism following the 2016 election, the rise of the Me Too movement and what some have dubbed another Year of the Woman, a record 530 women filed to run for Congress this year, smashing the 2012 record of 298 women who filed.\nAs of Aug. 22, more than 200 women have won their primaries, according to Politico. However, there\u2019s still a long road ahead to earning a seat at the Capitol \u2014 most of the women running are Democrats, and several of them are competing in strongly Republican districts.\nPew conducted the online survey of 4,587 people between June 19 and July 2.\nThe poll found that women were more favorable toward female candidates than men by 68 percent to 54 percent. Opinions were also divided among party lines, with Democrats more in favor: 80 percent of Democrat and Democratic-leaning respondents said the trend was a good thing, while 39 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents said the same.\nAmericans are undecided on whether more women in Congress would lead to more effectiveness, transparency and civility in politics, the poll found. More than half of respondents said more female Congress members would not change those problems.\nFollowing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential run, the poll revealed that more Americans would like to see a woman as commander in chief. Forty-five percent said they would want to elect a female president, up from 38 percent in 2014.\nThe rise in female candidates has not been limited to Congressional campaigns. There are currently eight sitting female governors, though the number could increase after the midterms. This year\u2019s 14 female gubernatorial candidates who won their primaries broke the previous record of 10, according to the Center for American Women and Politics.\nEMILY\u2019s List, which helps elect women who support female reproductive rights, said they have heard from more women than ever.\n}}
{{Is eating something that is too important for the Republicans' brand of compassion? That's a very good question, and one that a Nebraska congressman doesn't want to answer.\nDuring a recent appearance on NPR, Republican Rep. Adrian Smith of Nebraska refused to say that he believed Americans are entitled to eat. As a result of those seemingly insensitive comments, he may have to eat his own words.\nAdvertisement:\n[salon_video id=\"14773181\"]\nWhen host Scott Simon turned the subject of the interview toward proposed cuts in food stamps, Smith acknowledged that \"we do not want to leave our most vulnerable without nutrition\" but suggested that \"even very minor shifts can be very effective in terms of fiscal policy and, at the same time, make sure that we do not harm the most vulnerable among us.\"\nThis prompted Simon to ask Smith, \"Well, let me ask you this bluntly: Is every American entitled to eat?\" When Smith seemed to hedge in his response, characterizing nutrition as \"very important,\" Simon clarified that nutrition is \"not just important, it's essential for life. Is every American entitled to eat?\"\nSmith responded, \"It is essential. It is essential.\"\nSimon, not satisfied with the half-response, repeated his question: \"So is every American entitled to eat, and is food stamps something that ought to be that ultimate guarantor?\"\nWhen Smith repeated that \"there could be a number of ways that we could address that,\" Simon specifically asked whether Smith would support \"a budget that cuts food stamps?\"\n\"I want to look at an entire budget, look at all of the details,\" Smith replied. I'm still sifting through the details of the newly released budget. But we know that Congress ultimately has the say. I look for there to be a lot of changes made in the House and the Senate to the president's budget.\"\nAdvertisement:\nTrump's budget has been harshly criticized for removing the social safety net that protects Americans who are vulnerable from hunger, homeless and other forms of suffering associated with poverty.\n}}
{{American voters are fed up with the Republican-controlled Congress, saying it is corrupt, controlled by special interests and unresponsive to the people.\nThat\u2019s the finding of the latest New York Times/CBS poll.\nAs Adam Nagourney and Janet Elder report in The New York Times:\nWith the midterm elections less than seven weeks away, Americans have an overwhelmingly negative view of the Republican-controlled Congress, with substantial majorities saying that they disapprove of the job it is doing and that its members do not deserve reelection, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\nThe disregard for Congress is the most intense it has been since 1994, when Republicans captured 52 seats to end four decades of Democratic control of the House and retook the Senate as well. It underlines the challenge the Republican Party faces in trying to hold onto power in the face of a surge in anti-incumbent sentiment.\nBy overwhelming margins, respondents said that members of Congress were too tied to special interests and that they did not understand the needs and problems of average Americans. Two-thirds said Congress had accomplished less than it typically does in a two-year session; most said they said they could not name a single major piece of legislation that cleared this Congress. Just 25 percent said they approved of the way Congress was doing its job.\nThe Times/CBS News poll also found that President Bush did not improve his own or his party\u2019s standing through the intense campaign of speeches he made and events he attended surrounding the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The speeches were at the heart of a Republican strategy to thrust national security to the forefront in the fall elections.\nMr. Bush\u2019s job approval rating was 37 percent, virtually unchanged from the last Times/CBS News poll, which was conducted in August. On the issue that has been a bulwark for Mr. Bush, 54 percent said they approve of the way he is managing the effort to combat terrorists, again unchanged from last month, though up from earlier this spring.\nRepublicans continue to hold a slight edge over Democrats on which party is better at dealing with terrorism, though that edge did not grow since last month despite Mr. Bush\u2019s flurry of speeches on national security, including one from the Oval Office on the night of the Sept. 11 anniversary.\nBut the Times/CBS News poll found a slight increase in the percentage of Americans who say they approve of the way Mr. Bush has handled the war in Iraq, to 36 percent from 30 percent. It also suggests that after bottoming out this spring, Mr. Bush\u2019s approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy have returned to their levels of about a year ago, both at 37 percent. The number of people who called terrorism the most important issue facing the country doubled to 14 percent in this poll from 7 percent in July; 22 percent named the war in Iraq as their top concern, little changed from July.\nAcross the board, the poll found marked disenchantment with Congress, highlighting the opportunity that Democrats see to make the argument for a change in leadership and to make the election a national referendum on the performance of the Republican-controlled Congress and Mr. Bush\u2019s tenure. In one striking finding, 77 percent of respondents \u2014 including 65 percent of Republicans \u2014 said that most members of Congress had not done a good enough job to deserve re-election and that it was time to give new people a chance. That is the highest number of voters who said it was \u201ctime for new people\u201d since the fall of 1994.\n}}
{{In 1995, a PH.D candidate in Maritime Studies (specifically Chemical Pollution), by the name of H. Lindsey Arison III, wrote a report entitled \u201cThe \u2018Cover-Upof Gulf War Syndrome\u2019 A Question of National Integrity,\u201d where he discussed the toxic chemicals that American service personnel were exposed to during the first American invasion of Iraq and how that exposure may have been the cause or one important contributing factor to the mysterious Gulf War Syndrome that plagued so many soldiers and their families upon returning home.\nDr. Arison concluded:\nThe Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been lying to the U.S. Congress, Gulf War veterans, and the American people about coalition forces\u2019 exposure to chemical and biological agents during the war. This criminal, reprehensible, shameful, dishonorable, and egregious act on their part has caused incalculable pain and suffering, caused many who risked their lives for our flag to die, inflicted severe financial hardships, caused many veterans\u2019 children to be born deformed and disabled, caused many veterans\u2019 children to become diseased, destroyed marriages and families, and eroded the trust of the American people in the institutions they once revered. Gulf War veterans are truly the victims of patriotism. What they have suffered is the great American tragedy.Those who have perpetrated and perpetuated this lie must be held fully accountable.It should be noted that Dr. Anison was an aide to the Undersecretary of the United States Air Force at the Pentagon.\nPrior to Dr. Anison\u2019s report, the US Congress was forced to hold an investigative committee regarding the testing of chemicals, radiation, and other substances on military service personnel without their knowledge or consent. Of course, the committee only discussed experimentation which was already declassified and, for the most part, publicly available. It did not discuss secret and classified experimentation or ongoing experimentation either.\nNevertheless, the report did collect a number of important bullet points of experimentation on American military personnel including mustard gas, lewisite agents, hallucinogens, radiation, \u201cinvestigational drugs,\u201d and others.\nClick here to read full report which many Americans might find surprising. One should also consider the fact that the report is now nearly 24 years old and that experimentation on American soldiers has not ended, despite not being discussed publicly since the report was published. It goes some small length in describing how American service personnel have been used as guinea pigs for decades upon decades, a practice that shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n*\nBrandon Turbeville \u2013 article archive here \u2013 is an author out of Florence, South Carolina.

{{Donna Shalala is the first Lebanese American woman to hold a seat in the U.S. Congress.\nFLORIDA \u2013 Democratic candidate Donna Shalala won the seat vacated by retiring Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Florida\u2019s 27th Congressional District, with 51.7 percent of the votes, defeating her Republican opponent, Maria Elvira Salazar, who received 45 percent of the votes, to flip a House seat that has long been targeted by Democrats.\nShalala said she ran for Congress because she was angry at Donald Trump. And now she has Trump to thank for her new seat in Congress.\nShalala, is the second Lebanese American woman to hold a seat in the U.S. Congress. The first Lebanese American woman to enter U.S. Congress was Mary Rose Oakar from Clevelend, Ohio. Oakar was elected to Congress 1976 and took office in 1977. She left her seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002.\nShalala was awarded by former President George W. Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. award given to civilians.\nShe is well known in the district, having served as the president of the University of Miami for more than 10 years. On the campaign trail, Shalala emphasized her experience, including her eight-year tenure as secretary of Health and Human Services in President Clinton\u2019s administration. She also ran the Clinton Foundation for two years.\nShalala, 77, was born in 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Lebanese parents who immigrated to the United States in 1900. She would be among the oldest freshman House members in history.\nShe significantly out-raised and outspent her Republican opponent. Through Sept. 30, campaign finance reports show that Shalala raised $2.9 million, more than double the $1.2 million that Salazar raised.\nAs soon as the news of her victory spread, Lebanese social media users reported that Shalala visited Lebanon and stayed there for a week in 2000 at the invitation of Robert Chahine, the then-dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Lebanese University, and visited her ancestral home town of Beit Shalala in Batroun, Lebanon.\n}}
{{New York's Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, has introduced a parallel piece of legislation that would create a 2-year pilot green card program for science and tech grads without nixing the so-called diversity visas.\nThus, a consensus issue has been split down party lines. As a result, it might not even make it through the House, where it will take a two-thirds majority to pass under the special procedure that's being used to bring it to a vote.\nIn fairness to the GOP, the diversity visa program has its share of problems. Created in 1990, it randomly selects applicants from qualified countries who either have the equivalent of a high school education and at least two years of work experience in a job the requires training. They don't need to have any family here in the states, prospects for employment, or special skills. But as the Government Accountability Office noted in a lengthy 2007 report, even the bare minimum qualifications can be hard to enforce. Although the lottery winners are subject to an extensive background check before they can receive their green card, applicants often submit fake documents, frequently with the help of corrupt local officials. The State Department, meanwhile, has cautioned that such frauds could open the door to national security problems, since the program admits citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism, such as Iran.\nAlthough there's no actual evidence that rogue states are using the diversity program to funnel terrorists into our borders, these are sincere concerns that should be addressed. But why now? Conservatives have had their sites on the diversity visa program for a while. What's the policy rationale of letting this particular fight potentially sink an idea that everyone otherwise agrees would be good for the country?\nTo get an explanation, I called up the House Judiciary Committee, where one of the aides spoke to me on background. Theey explained that committee chair Lamar Smith of Texas, \"did not want to increase legal immigration at a time when 8 percent of Americans are unemployed.\"\nBad answer. Right now, jobs might be scarce. But over the long term, as the Baby Boomers beginning to retire, the United States will need more young immigrants to come here so they can work and pay taxes. Moreover, it's a bit nutty to suggest that engineering Ph.D.'s are competing in the same job market as high school grads from, say, Chad. You might think that by limiting the number of low-skill immigrants, we'll open up opportunities for unemployed Americans. But that has nothing to do with the number of science grads kicking around into the country.\nFrom policy perspective, then, there's really no reason these two programs should be mentioned in the same breath, other than that they both involve the word \"immigrant.' Yet, if I were a congressional Democrat, I'd still accept the Republicans' offer. While the long-term aim should be to welcome more immigrants to the country, the GOP authored bill doesn't cut the number down. And while some may worry at sealing off an avenue for immigration permanently, it's a flawed avenue that could be made up for by expanding other programs if we ever get a comprehensive immigration reform bill one day. Keeping more foreign science whizzes on our shores would be a worthwhile upgrade.\nBut should we expect compromise from either side on this? You tell me.\n}}
{{Ilhan Omar\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota \u2014 Ilhan Omar is a Somali American politician who escaped from Somalia as a child, grew up in a Kenyan refugee camp and later immigrated to Minnesota.\nYears after immigrating, she became the nation\u2019s first and only Somali American lawmaker when she won a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives in November 2016. Now, Omar is ready to become the first Somali American member of Congress.\nOmar has been the focus of national media attention, appearing on The Daily Show, the cover of TIME Magazine and recently in a music video for Maroon 5. She was also the subject of a documentary that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year.\nShe has gained a lot of support, especially from other minorities, because of her commitment to public service and to hopefully serve as a voice to fight against President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\u201cMy success is not only for me but for every Somali, Muslim and minority group, particularly the young girls in the Dadaab refugee camp, where I lived before coming to the U.S.,\u201d Omar said.\nOmar, who worked as the director of policy at Women Organizing Women Network \u2014 a group dedicated to pushing East African women into civic leadership \u2014 is credited with being a talented organizer and leader of a multiracial coalition that includes Minneapolis progressives.\nThe decision of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D- Minn.), the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, not to seek re-election was what prompted Omar to run for his seat. Ellison decided to run for Minnesota attorney general instead of seeking re-election to Congress.\nOmar said she is confident she\u2019ll win. On Aug. 14, the primary election will be held to choose the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for the seat. The Fifth Congressional District is mostly Democratic; whoever wins the primary election will most likely be the winner in November. The district represents Minneapolis and several suburbs to the west.\n\u201cI have proven myself to be someone who shows up, takes on the hard fight and delivers,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd I am ready to do that for the people of the fifth Congressional District.\u201d\nState Sen. Patricia Torres and state Rep. Margaret Anderson Kelliher, both Democrats, have also filed and will be competing with Omar for the seat.\nWhether or not Ilhan Omar wins this upcoming election, she is continuing to break barriers and remain a role model for women and people of color.\nSomalia is a member of the League of Arab States, which consists of 22 countries. Somalia also is one of the Muslim majority countries that are listed on Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n}}

{{IIhan Omar gained international attention in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American to be elected to a state legislature. She has made history again by winning a Democratic primary in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, which could see her go all the way to Congress.\nFormer Somali refugee and Minnesota state lawmaker IIhan Omar is favoured to take a seat in Congress after winning her Democratic primary in a heavily left-leaning Minnesota voting district.\n\"Tonight we are celebrating because we engaged and empowered our community - and we won!\" Ms Omar said in a statement. \"Our campaign staff, our volunteers and the people of the Fifth Congressional District are the inspiration we need to get up every day and fight for a democracy that guarantees a more just and equitable society.\"\nShe has the potential to be among the few Islamic women elected to Congress. Congress currently has only two Muslim lawmakers and both of them are men. In her career, Omar has championed left-leaning policies, including Medicare for all, a US$15 minimum wage and abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nPosting on Twitter shortly after her Minneapolis win was announced, Ms Omar said:\nHer winning speech was inspiring and she is set on providing representation that girls from her background and circumstances can aspire to.\nIn Trump's America, it was always unlikely that Ms Omar's campaign would proceed without a hitch. According to VOX, the news and opinion website, Omar has faced Islamophobic attacks from the alt-right in the course of her campaign from conservative media outlets, who have baselessly claimed that she was once married to her brother and has ties to terrorists. President Donald Trump himself targeted Omar's district, warning that Somali immigrants were a \"disaster\" for Minnesota.\nOmar said President Trump's \"politics of fear\" motivated her to get in the race.\n\"This is a district that is very much interested in making sure our progressive values are represented, and they know the only way they'll continue to be represented is if we have people who are not going to just think about getting themselves to Washington, but think about getting other progressives to Washington,\" VOX quoted her saying.\nFollowing in Omar's footsteps is Hodan Hassan, who won the Democratic primary race for Minneapolis House District 62A, becoming the second Somali-American female, after Omar, to be elected to a state legislature.\nIn fact, several other Muslim women are running for Congress in districts where primaries are yet to occur, including Deedra Abboud, who is running for Senate in Arizona, and Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, a House candidate in Massachusetts.\nIt seems that diversity is the main trend in this year's American primary and special elections. Another notable addition to the women of colour from various religions vying for office are gay, lesbian and transgender candidates. In Vermont, Christine Hallquist become the first transgender candidate to win a major political party's nomination for governor. The 62-year-old beat three other Democrats to secure the victory in the fight for more inclusive representation for people of all backgrounds, religion, gender and orientation.\n}}
{{Sen. Rand Paul was one of two Republicans who voted to remove the military\u2019s power to detain U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism\nPhoto by Tom Pennington/Getty Images\nOn Tuesday 60 members of the United States Senate voted to preserve a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act\u2014that would be the bill that funds the Pentagon\u2014allowing the U.S. military to pick up and detain, without charges or trial, anyone suspected of terrorism, including American citizens, and to restrict transfers of prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay. Specifically, 60 senators voted against an amendment that would have invalidated the part of the bill which empowers the president and the military to detain anyone they suspect was involved in the 9/11 attacks or supports al-Qaida, the Taliban, or \u201cassociated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.\u201d\nThere are two disputed sections of the bill, as Charlie Savage explains. One \u201cwould require the government to place into military custody any suspected member of Al Qaeda or one of its allies connected to a plot against the United States or its allies. The provision would exempt American citizens, but would otherwise extend to arrests on United States soil. The executive branch could issue a waiver and keep such a prisoner in the civilian system.\u201d The second provision \u201cwould create a federal statute saying the government has the legal authority to keep people suspected of terrorism in military custody, indefinitely and without trial. It contains no exception for American citizens.\u201d\nSo forget the presumption of innocence. Forget the protections of the Constitution. If you are suspected of terrorism, you may be held indefinitely, maybe even shipped off to Guantanamo. And in this war that will last forever and play out on every square inch of the planet, the chances that these new powers will ever be rolled back are negligible. Even long after the war on terror has waned.\nNow, perhaps you suspect these thorny questions about the handling of terrorists are best left to the experts, and that the Senate was simply listening to them. Such suspicions would be unfounded. The secretary of defense, the director of national intelligence, the director of the FBI, the CIA director, and the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division have all said that the indefinite detention provisions in the bill are a bad idea. And the White House continues to say that the president will veto the bill if the detainee provisions are not removed. It sees the proposed language as limiting its flexibility.\nThere may be no good outcome here. It could be an unholy victory for both the prospect of unbridled executive power and for the collapse of any meaningful separation between domestic law enforcement and military authority. The law manages to expand the role of the military in domestic terror prosecutions and also limit the authority of the civilian justice system to thwart terrorism. These were legal principles to which even the Bush administration said they adhered.\nAs Adam Serwer explains: This new legislation will \u201coverturn a precedent that was followed almost without exception by the Bush administration: Domestic terrorism arrests are the province of law enforcement, not the military.\u201d Raha Wala of Human Rights First notes that \u201cauthorizing the military to detain terror suspects apprehended within the United States clearly goes against the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that has prevented the military from taking on domestic law enforcement functions since the Civil War.\u201d If you think the blurring of domestic policing and military authority is an Orwellian fantasy, you may want to consider the treatment of Occupy Wall Street protestors in recent weeks, or Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s claim that \u201cI have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh biggest army in the world.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t bring the battlefield into our backyard for any number of obvious reasons, and redefining our backyard as the battlefield for all time doesn\u2019t make any of us safer or more free. As Sen. Mark Udall, who proposed the amendment removing these provisions from the bill, wrote Monday in the Washington Post: \u201cThese proposed changes would require the military to take on a new responsibility as police, jailors and judges\u2014jobs for which it is not equipped and which it does not want. These changes to our laws would also authorize the military to exercise unprecedented power on U.S. soil.\u201d\nThe underlying rationale for allowing the military such unprecedented power is the tiresome assertion that all of our current strategies against terrorism have failed. It\u2019s almost as if the bill\u2019s sponsors think that there have been multiple successful terrorist attacks since 9/11; that dozens of terrorists have been freed as a result of the sloppy civilian justice system; and that domestic law enforcement has failed in its efforts to combat terror. None of that is true. Congress appears determined to do away with every tactic that has identified and halted terror attacks in the past 10 years, and to enshrine into the law everything that has failed.\nThose who voted against the Udall Amendment were at great pains to say that the law targets only bad terrorists, not good Americans. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said: \u201cThe enemy is all over the world. Here at home. And when people take up arms against the United States and [are] captured within the United States, why should we not be able to use our military and intelligence community to question that person as to what they know about enemy activity? They should not be read their Miranda rights. They should not be given a lawyer. They should be held humanely in military custody and interrogated about why they joined al Qaida and what they were going to do to all of us.\u201d\nBut who decides what constitutes the \u201call of us\u201d and what constitutes the \u201cthey\u201d? That\u2019s the very definition of due process. The detainee language only makes us all safer if you assume that \u201cthey\u201d are always guilty whenever the government says so. It\u2019s the job of the courts to decide whether the government is right. Justice Antonin Scalia himself put it this way: \u201cWhere the Government accuses a citizen of waging war against it, our constitutional tradition has been to prosecute him in federal court for treason or some other crime. \u2026 The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive.\u201d\nOne of the two Republican senators to vote for the Udall Amendment yesterday was Sen. Rand Paul, who quoted Thomas Jefferson: \u201cThe means of defense against foreign danger historically have become instruments of tyranny at home.\u201d No. Truer. Words. At this moment in America we seem to be so fond of dividing Americans into us and them that we have created all sorts of intriguing new legal double standards for the thems. Don\u2019t think for a minute that these new powers will be used only against suspected terrorists. We already know that suspected illegal immigrants, suspected environmental activists, and suspected protesters have very different legal rights\u2014which is to say, far more limited rights\u2014than anyone else. And as Benjamin Wallace Wells detailed last August, the landmark anti-terror legislation known as the Patriot Act has, in the 10 years since its passage, been used in 1,618 drug cases and 15 terrorism cases. You\u2019d never know it from watching the GOP hopefuls joyfully demonize women, immigrants, the poor, the prisoners, OWS protesters, and union members, but at some point, them always becomes us.\n}}
{{Democratic Congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar was working on a TV advertisement to boost his exposure when news broke that his opponent, the heavily favored Republican U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, was indicted on corruption charges.\nThe 29-year-old former Obama administration Labor Department official whose father is a Palestinian Muslim and mother a Mexican American Catholic has never held elected office. In Hunter, he\u2019s taking on a widely known Iraq war veteran who coasted through the June primary in the most Republican district in Southern California with a 30-point, first-place finish after serving five terms.\nWith the indictment , Campa-Najjar suddenly found himself thrust in the spotlight \u2014 fielding calls throughout the night from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, supporters and even some local Republican elected officials. Within 24 hours, he received hundreds of emails and gave nearly two dozen interviews to local and national media outlets.\nIt was the attention, he said, his campaign deserved.\nAfter months of knocking on doors, Campa-Najjar is seizing the opportunity to re-introduce himself to voters in the 50th District, many of whom are not familiar with his name.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Campa-Najjar said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t crow over the misery of other people. I feel for him and his family, but I feel more for the people of our district who deserve some much-needed representation after many years of not having a real representative.\u201d\nThe Hunter name is something of a political dynasty in the area. Hunter\u2019s father was elected to the seat in 1980 and held it until his son won it in 2008.\nBut the indictment of Hunter and his wife, Margaret, that alleges they illegally converted his campaign account into a household checkbook reorders his re-election contest, giving Democrats a suddenly stronger hand in a district that for decades has embraced Republican candidates. The Hunters pleaded not guilty Thursday.\nCampa-Najjar said he was hopeful of breaking the Hunter family\u2019s nearly 40-year hold on the district that runs largely east of coastal San Diego, abutting Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base and stretching toward a remote area near the U.S.-Mexico border.\nCampa-Najjar vows to reach people who had voted for President Obama in 2008 and eight years later backed Donald Trump. He said, \u201cThey are not ignorant. They are ignored, by my party, their party and the country.\u201d\nHe said he offers \u201csensible solutions\u201d that cross party lines, including Medicare-for-all if it does not increase government debt and free college tuition based on merit and need.\nHe does not believe in abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, like some liberal candidates. Campa-Najjar, who lives in Jamul near the U.S.-Mexico border, said walls are not the answer when 40 percent of those entering the U.S. illegally come by plane and overstay their visas. He supports tougher fines for employers who break immigration laws and believes that immigrants who were brought to the United States as children should be given U.S. citizenship.\nCampa-Najjar said his motivation for running is personal.\nHis mother, who divorced his father when he was 8 and raised Campa-Najjar and his brother, did not have the support she should have from the government.\nAt 15, he worked as a janitor to help her pay the bills.\nBorn in San Diego County, Campa-Najjar spent part of his childhood in Gaza before coming back to San Diego County, and is fluent in Spanish and Arabic.\nCampa-Najjar said he is proud of his heritage, but is American first. He has made clear that he has no personal connection to his grandfather, who was the member of a Palestinian terror group and orchestrated an attack in the early 1970s that killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.\nCampa-Najjar said he never met his grandfather, who was killed by Israeli commandos 16 years before Campa-Najjar was born.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to take responsibility for my own choices and my own decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think other men are responsible for their own crimes, whether it\u2019s somebody who I share a lineage with and nothing else, or a sitting Congressman who\u2019s being indicted and could be facing serious charges in the future. \u201d\nAbout a third of the district is Latino and it is also home to one of the largest Iraqi Chaldean populations in the United States. One of Campa-Najjar campaign offices is in the city of El Cajon, east of San Diego. It\u2019s near a business district with falafel shops, taco stands and signs in Arabic, English and Spanish, reflecting the district\u2019s changing demographics as immigrants and refugees have settled there.\nIt is in a dilapidated home with yellow tape around the front porch. On a recent day, a paper sign on the door, under Campa-Najjar\u2019s portrait on a red white and blue poster, told visitors to knock on the back door.\nCampa-Najjar\u2019s campaign has been a largely grassroots operation that until now has largely gone unnoticed as Democrats have concentrated on other districts believed to be more vulnerable for Republicans. The Republican Party holds a nearly 15-point registration edge over Democrats, and President Trump won the district by the same margin while losing statewide by more than 4 million votes in 2016.\nBut that changed this week.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of support as you can imagine,\u201d Campa-Najjar said.\nThere is no doubt a win would be an upset even with the allegations against Hunter and his wife. The couple has been charged by a federal grand jury with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to finance family trips to Italy and Hawaii, golf outings, school tuition and theater tickets.\nVoters in Hunter\u2019s rural hometown of Alpine were sharply divided on what it all means. Some are shocked, some outraged and some are rising to defend Hunter and his claim of being pursued by politically motivated prosecutors eager to see one of Trump\u2019s early supporters in Congress fall. Hunter says his \u201cconstituents are not easily misled\u201d and he will fight the allegations the same way he fought as a Marine.\nCampa-Najjar said he feels \u201csaddened a bit\u201d that a combat veteran returned from the battlefield and lost his way, becoming the \u201cposter child of corruption\u201d for Washington. He added that voters, including Hunter\u2019s base, want honest politicians.\n\u201cIf we are a nation of laws, then you cannot in good conscience vote for Duncan Hunter,\u201d he said.\n}}
{{Ammar Campa-Najjar\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 A candidate for the U.S. Congress in the state of California is hoping to become its first Latino-Arab American member by capturing a district that has voted Republican for the past 30 years.\nAmmar Campa-Najjar, a 29-year-old former field campaign director for President Obama, White House staffer and a labor department official, said he wants to bring positive change to California\u2019s demographically changing 50th district.\nCampa-Najjar, who is of mixed Palestinian and Mexican heritage, has promised voters to work on rebuilding jobs for the middle class instead of the wall that President Trump intends to build on the Mexican border.\nHe has been endorsed by the California Democratic Party to stand against the Republican incumbent, Duncan D. Hunter.\nHe said his campaign is focused on helping the people of his district improve their living conditions and rebuild the middle class neglected by Hunter.\nCampa-Najjar does not shy away from either his Palestinian or Mexican heritage. However, he insisted he is an \u201cAmerican first and foremost.\u201d\nHe told Al Jazeera he is proud of being the son of a hard-working Mexican mother, who struggled to raise him and his brother, and a Palestinian father who strived to make peace between Palestinians and Israelis in the 1990s.\nAn Israeli newspaper reported that Campa-Najjar\u2019s grandfather was a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization and was assassinated by an Israeli hit squad in 1973 after being accused of being a \u201cterrorist\u201d by Israel.\nIsrael considered all members of the PLO to be \u201cterrorists\u201d before it recognized it as a legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and made the Oslo peace agreement with it in 1993.\nCampa-Najjar told Al Jazeera he is proud of his background as a Palestinian, saying he \u201csupports peace and reconciliation between Palestinian and Israelis.\u201d\n\u201cThe local Jewish community in the San Diego area came out and publicly defended me as an American who has nothing to do with the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Middle Eastern community in the area also rallied around me and supported my campaign for Congress.\u201d\nThe district is about 35 percent Latino and 15 percent of Middle Eastern descent.\nCampa-Najjar said he could not change the past, but unlike others, he can use his family\u2019s history and understanding of the conflict in the Middle East and turn into something positive.\n\u201cOur past is not our present or our future and this campaign is not about my family\u2019s past, rather about every family right in this district,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am committed to work on peace in the Middle East because I lived there during the conflict and witnessed the horrors and destruction it brings,\u201d he added.\nCampa-Najjar said he also opposes Trump\u2019s travel ban because it is based on Islamophobia, not on legitimate national security and legal concerns.\n\u201cThe Trump travel ban is both unconstitutional and immoral because of its basis in Islamophobia,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the administration\u2019s changing the letter of the law, it\u2019s the spirit of the law and original intent to ban all Muslims that makes it a violation of constitutional law.\u201d\nHe said the U.S. should focus on rebuilding its infrastructure and battered communities instead of waging wars abroad.\n}}
{{It would take the combined wealth of more than 18 American households to equal the value of a single federal lawmaker\u2019s household, the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 latest analysis of congressional wealth finds.\nThe median net worth of a member of Congress was $1,029,505 in 2013 \u2014 a 2.5 percent increase from 2012 \u2014 compared with an average American household\u2019s median net worth of $56,355. Once again, the majority of members of Congress are millionaires \u2014 271 of the 533 members currently in office, or 50.8 percent.\nWhile the median net worth of an American family has declined by nearly one-third between 2007 and 2013, members of Congress have recovered quite well from the recession. The Senate\u2019s median net worth went from $2.3 million to $2.8 million over that period, while for members of the House the numbers went from $708,500 to $843,507.\nNot all members of Congress are millionaires. While there are seven whose net worth is in the nine figures, totaling at least $100 million, there are two dozen who are in the minus column.\nThose are the extremes. But overall, CRP\u2019s annual analysis of lawmakers\u2019 financial statements once again shows that they are not remotely similar to the typical American in terms of wealth, investments and economic security.\nHalf of this year\u2019s freshman class were already millionaires upon their arrival. While the retirement of one senator whose name is the very symbol of wealth \u2014 Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.), whose median net worth was $101.2 million in 2012 \u2014 might have been expected to depress Congress\u2019 numbers, the incoming freshmen include Rep. Dave Trott (R-Mich.) and his net worth of $200.5 million.\n\u201cAt a time when income inequality is much debated, the representatives we choose are overwhelmingly affluent,\u201d said CRP\u2019s Executive Director Sheila Krumholz. \u201cWhether voters elect them because they are successful or because people of modest means do not run, or for other reasons, is unclear, but struggling Americans should not assume that their elected officials understand their circumstances.\u201c\nIt\u2019s almost never a down year for Congress. Since OpenSecrets.org began publishing an annual report on lawmakers\u2019 net worth in 2006, the numbers have increased every year but one \u2014 2008. This year\u2019s jump of over 2.5 percent is slightly less than the increase between 2011 and 2012 of 4.4 percent, but still greater than the rate of inflation.\nNot all subgroups have grown their wealth, though. In 2013, the median net worth of all Democratic members dropped below $1 million, a decline of 14.3 percent from 2012. Republicans, however, had a good year. Their median net worth was barely $1 million in 2012, and in 2013 it eased into more comfortable millionaire territory, $1.1 million \u2014 an increase of 10.1 percent.\nThe House\u2019s median net worth of $843,507 is an increase over the $708,500 figure in 2007, and it is a 3.6 percent increase from the previous year. Senators fared slightly better as well, though the median net worth in that chamber crept up less than the rate of inflation, from $2,794,024 to $2,794,518 in 2013.\nCRP\u2019s analysis is based on financial disclosure forms filed by members of Congress in May 2014, reporting assets and liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2013. For freshmen members, CRP uses candidate filings made in 2014 covering the previous year. The law allows lawmakers to report the value of their individual debts and holdings in ranges.\nAdding up the average value of the current 533 members who have filed their reports, Congress was worth roughly $4.3 billion in 2013 \u2014 the equivalent of more than 76,000 typical American households, and a $400 million increase from the last Congress in 2012. Rep. Steve Knight (R-Calif.) has not filed a disclosure to date and Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) resigned the day before the new Congress was sworn in.\nWealthiest Individuals\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) retains his claim as the wealthiest member of Congress, with an average net worth of $448.4 million. That\u2019s an eye-popping number but it is also a $15.6 million decline from his value last year. Issa made his fortune with the car alarm business he built from scratch, but according to his most recent disclosure, the bulk of his money is now invested in high yield mutual funds. He also owes $75 million to $100 million on two personal loans.\nThe wealthiest member of the Senate \u2014 and second richest member of Congress \u2014 is Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who comes in at $254.1 million. Like Issa, Warner is slightly less wealthy than he was in 2012.\nOf the other five members worth $100 million or more, two are Republicans and three are Democrats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi broke into the nine figures in 2013, increasing her average net worth from $87.9 million in 2012 to $100.8 million in 2013. Pelosi\u2019s increased wealth seems to result from the increased value of several pieces of property she owned in northern California. She also has a stake in the United States Football League, worth between $5 million and $25 million, and a similar-sized stake in the league\u2019s Sacramento franchise.\nThe Top 20 Wealthiest Members\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) remains the poorest member of Congress, at least on paper. His net worth in 2013 was negative $11.5 million, which is actually a $575,000 improvement from 2012. This is the third year running that Valadao has brought up the rear of the net worth list, apparently because of sizable revolving loans he has taken out to support his family dairy farm.\nThe poorest member of the Senate is, once again, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). On paper, she\u2019s worth just $32,500, her only reported asset being a checking account. Disclosure forms don\u2019t require lawmakers or candidates to report the values of their primary residences, but where they do we have included the values in our analysis.\nThe median net worth of freshmen lawmakers this year was $995,000.\nOf the 14 new senators, only six are true freshmen who didn\u2019t jump from the House to the Senate and thus entered Congress, and our analysis, for the first time. All six are Republicans, and five had an average net worth of $1 million or more in 2013\nThe wealthiest was Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), the former chief executive of Dollar General, whose average net worth tallies up to be $31.6 million. Perdue is heavily invested in stocks and bonds, especially Georgia state and local municipal bonds. He also reported between $1.3 million and $5.6 million in deferred \u201cboard compensation,\u201d mainly from the Alliant Energy natural gas and electric utility company. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the least wealthy of the incoming senators, with an average net worth of $504,000.\nTrott was the wealthiest incoming freshman in the House and Senate combined, with an average net worth of $200.5 million. He represents a district in suburban Detroit and is one person who has done well from that city\u2019s hard luck. Trott made much of his fortune in the mortgage crisis last decade. His largest investment in 2013 was Trott & Trott, a real estate law firm that specialized in representing lenders (he unloaded his stake in the firm before the election). He also listed investments in Detroit Legal News Publishing (a legal newspaper that publishes foreclosure notices) and a title company that handled much of the paperwork for foreclosures.\nThe least wealthy member of the freshman class is Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C), a pastor, who had a listed average net worth of negative $67,000. Walker\u2019s debts included $15,000 to $50,000 in student loans.\nCongressional Holdings\nAs in years past, the most popular investment for members of Congress was real estate \u2014 either property itself or companies in the real estate business. The value of congressional real estate holdings varies widely because of the ranges permitted on disclosure forms but could be anywhere between $357 million and $1.2 billion.\nMany members of Congress have significant investments in specific pieces of property. These are mostly commercial \u2014 Issa, for instance, owns a number of pieces of commercial real estate, like a building that houses a Hooters restaurant and an industrial property that is leased by a nonprofit for its work program for developmentally disabled adults. Pelosi\u2019s commercial property includes numerous buildings in San Francisco\u2019s soaring market, like a 59,000 square foot brick warehouse near the waterfront that is being leased for office space. Pelosi lists its value as $5 million to $25 million.\nPelosi also reported a Napa vineyard, worth between $5 million and $25 million. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) listed her family\u2019s 10,000-acre Sunny Slope Ranch as being worth between $2 million and $6 million.\nAfter real estate, the securities and investment industry draws the most congressional investment \u2014 again, either through stakes in financial services companies or their products, like mutual and investment funds. Congressional investment here is valued between $90.3 million and $253.7 million. Congressional investment in commercial banks is almost identical, between $90.3 million and $212.4 million in 2013.\nOwnership of individual stocks is becoming less common, as we\u2019ve noted in previous years. The stock most widely held by members of Congress is, once again, that stalwart of the New York Stock Exchange, General Electric; 62 members own shares of GE worth as much as $63 million in total. In previous years, General Electric was far and away the most widely held stock; this year the stock is only slightly more popular than runner-up Wells Fargo, in which 58 members are invested.\nTop 20 Congressional Stocks\nThat\u2019s not to say members of Congress are getting out of the stock market, but they are using more mutual funds, managed portfolios, and hedge funds. Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who is the third richest member of Congress with an average 2013 net worth of $222.4 million, lists investments with hedge funds like Blue Spruce Fund and Farallon Capital Management, the investment firm and hedge fund founded by Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer.\nMany lawmakers also own part or all of the various businesses. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) owns a stake worth between $5 million and $25 million in Zepto Matrix Corp Biotechnology, a biotech firm that handles highly infectious diseases, and a similar stake in Innate Immunotherapeutics MS Drug Development, a company developing drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. Rep. Vernon Buchanan (R-Fla.), who was worth an average of $98.2 million, owned several car dealerships and an aircraft leasing business. Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), son of Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney, lists a stake in Yonkers Raceway, a New York horse racing track, and casino, that he values at between $6.5 million and $31 million. Given that investment, it\u2019s not surprising that Rooney also reported owning a two-year-old racehorse, valued at between $1,000 and $15,000.\nDownload the full list of all current members of Congress and the most popular congressional investments here.\nFor permission to reprint for commercial uses, such as textbooks, contact the Center: Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics.For permission to reprint for commercial uses, such as textbooks, contact the Center: [email protected]\n}}
{{The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.\n-John Marshall\nMarch 7, 1800\n6th Congress\nOne of the oldest conflicts in the American system of government is that between Congress and the President over the right to formulate and implement foreign policy. Is the President solely responsible for the conduct of external relations? Is the Congress an equal partner? Or does Congress have the right to shape U.S. policy by enacting legislation which proscribes a President's flexibility? These are not just debating points for historians and constitutional lawyers, but critical issues which need to be addressed if we are to see the successful exercise of American diplomacy in the 1980s. Our effectiveness in dealing with the problems ahead, especially U.S.-Soviet competition in the Third World, will depend to a significant degree on our ability to resolve the adversary relationship between the President and Congress.\nThe struggle for control of foreign policy came to the fore in the twentieth century, with America's reluctant entry into world affairs, two World Wars, and a smaller, but more complex, postwar bipolar world characterized by the increasing interdependence of nations. The first significant Congressional challenge to the Executive's foreign policy prerogative occurred during the interwar years. After the Senate rejected President Wilson's Versailles Treaty in 1920, Congress continued to assert itself in the formulation of foreign policy. By the 1930s, a strong Congress was able to prevent presidential initiative in the critical prewar years. The almost universal consensus today is that this Congressional intrusion had been a disaster and had inhibited the United States from playing a useful role in Europe that might have prevented World War II.\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and our entry into the Second World War, Congress and the President stood in agreement over the direction of American foreign and military policy. Congressional intervention all but ceased.\nThe post-World War II period was marked by a reasonable\n}}
{{By Bill of Rights Defense Committee\nLast New Year\u2019s Eve, while most Americans were out celebrating, President Obama signed into law the most potentially oppressive national security legislation considered in our country since the onset of the war on terror more than 10 years ago. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (NDAA) includes military detention provisions that, along with the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF), could enable any future president to suspend the right to trial and detain Americans indefinitely in military custody without trial.\nIf you thought the PATRIOT Act was bad, the NDAA is even worse. It could be used to criminalize any political party or ideology, round up ethnic minorities, enable recurring torture in military custody, or suspend the right to trial for people the government wants to detain (for whatever reason) without having to establish proof of any crime.\nLegions of Americans, from across the country and across the political spectrum, have already come together to raise their voices. Can you spare just one minute to raise your voice now? Go to link, find your representative and send them a message. Can you spare just one minute to raise your voice now?\nSeveral pieces of legislation aim to correct the domestic military detention powers of the NDAA and AUMF. Congress may debate them beginning this Wednesday:\nAn amendment offered by Reps. Adam Smith (D-WA) and Justin Amash (R-MI), also supported by Senator Mark Udall (D-CO), provides among the strongest protections of any of the congressional bills.\nTwo other amendments, one introduced by Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), and another championed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), are even stronger. But even though they offer the most principled congressional responses to the military detention controversy, they may never come up for a vote because they lack broad support.\nUnfortunately, a third amendment authored by Reps. Scott Rigell (R-VA) and Jeff Landry (R-LA), as well as a fourth by Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), are both counterproductive and could make the NDAA even worse.\nWith oppressive national security policies continuing to emerge from Washington, it will take a movement of millions to restore the rule of law in the United States. If you share BORDC\u2019s concerns about the NDAA and looming specter of indefinite military detention, call your members of Congress today.\nTell your senators and representative that you expect them to support efforts to restore due process and the right to trial. Urge them to vote in favor of the Smith-Amash-Udall amendment when it comes up for a vote, and to help bring the Nadler and Paul proposals to the floor.\nBill of Rights Defense Committee \u2013 www.bordc.org\nEditor: There is also a local San Diego County group that is working on this same issue, Save the Bill of Rights \u2013 see SavetheBillofRights.net \u2013 and see earlier posts on the NDAA here.\n}}
{{In the wake of Congressional Republicans\u2019 failure to drum up support for their health plan last month, the White House is negotiating to put repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, back on the table. While the previous proposal would have already driven up health care costs and stripped millions of coverage, the new proposal is rumored to include provisions that would undo protections for the more than 130 million Americans who have a pre-existing health condition.\nRepublicans are now discussing a provision that is effectively a sick tax on premiums: People with health conditions would be charged multiples more based on their medical history, paying above-standard rates for coverage. Even if the new plan preserved the ACA\u2019s rules on guaranteed issue\u2014meaning that issuers cannot deny coverage\u2014consumers with pre-existing conditions could still be priced out of the market.\nPrior to the ACA, insurers could discriminate against consumers based on their current health conditions and medical history. Consumers with common ailments, including asthma and high blood pressure, were charged higher rates. People with histories of serious conditions, such as cancer or heart attacks, were regularly denied coverage altogether.\nAbout half of nonelderly Americans have one or more pre-existing health conditions, according to a recent brief by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, that examined the prevalence of conditions that would have resulted in higher rates, condition exclusions, or coverage denials before the ACA. Approximately 130 million nonelderly people have pre-existing conditions nationwide, and, as shown in the table available below, there is an average of more than 300,000 per congressional district. Nationally, the most common pre-existing conditions were high blood pressure (44 million people), behavioral health disorders (45 million people), high cholesterol (44 million people), asthma and chronic lung disease (34 million people), and osteoarthritis and other joint disorders (34 million people).\nWhile people with Medicaid or employer-based plans would remain covered regardless of medical history, the repeal of pre-ex protections means that the millions with pre-existing conditions would face higher rates if they ever needed individual market coverage. The return of pre-ex discrimination would hurt older Americans the most. As noted earlier, while about 51 percent of the nonelderly population had at least one pre-existing condition in 2014, according to the HHS brief, the rate was 75 percent of those ages 45 to 54 and 84 percent among those ages 55 to 64. But even millions of younger people, including 1 in 4 children, would be affected by eliminating this protection.\nJettisoning pre-existing condition protections would undermine the fundamental purpose of health insurance, including providing both the healthy and sick access to care and protecting families from financial ruin. Medical history should not be a barrier to affordable coverage.\nEmily Gee is a Health Economist at the Center for American Progress.\nTo download the table by congressional district, click here.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the number of people with pre-existing conditions by congressional district, we obtained estimates of the nonelderly population from the 2015 American Community Survey, or ACS, then subtracted out the number of nonelderly people who are covered by Medicare and would not be subject to possible discrimination based on a pre-existing condition. For the three states that recently redistricted\u2014Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia\u2014we used ACS county estimates and a crosswalk provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation to approximate current district boundaries for the 115th Congress.\nWe then applied pre-existing condition rates in the HHS brief to the ACS data to obtain the number of people in each age group with a pre-existing condition that could subject them to coverage carve-outs, higher rates, or coverage denials. Because HHS\u2019s data source was 2014 Medical Panel Expenditure Survey and our population estimates are from the more recent 2015 ACS, our national total number of people with pre-existing conditions is slightly higher than that of HHS.\n}}

{{Senate Republicans have put forward a tax plan that would give corporations a permanent tax cut while raising taxes on millions of families. The plan would be a windfall for the richest Americans: In 2027, nearly 62 percent of its benefits would accrue to the top 1 percent. Yet, many families would end up paying more at tax time. And because the bill would increase the deficit by more than $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years, it would trigger automatic cuts to important government programs\u2014including $25 billion in cuts to Medicare in 2018\u2014resulting in additional burdens on working- and middle-class families.\nThe Senate majority bill threatens access to affordable health insurance by eliminating the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, which would drive up premiums by 10 percent in 2019. And under this bill, all other changes on the individual side of the tax code expire after 2025, with one exception: changing the inflation measure used by the tax code to the chained Consumer Price Index. This change actually raises taxes on individuals, since tax brackets, credits, and other provisions would grow slower than under current law. According to the Tax Policy Center, even when benefits to individuals from the bill\u2019s corporate tax cuts are included, 87 million families making less than $200,000 nationally would experience a tax increase under the Senate tax plan by 2027.\nInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) simulations provide state-level estimates on how many families would pay more in taxes under the Senate majority plan in 2027. Here, we present the number of families in the bottom 80 percent of each state\u2019s income distribution\u2014those with incomes below $95,270 to $206,160, varying by state\u2014that would receive tax increases, based on ITEP\u2019s simulations. The number varies from state to state due in part to differences in population across states, state and local tax rates, and sources of income. All but three states would see more than 100,000 families with tax increases in 2027. In 14 states, more than 1 million families would see tax increases in 2027 under the plan.\nThe results are presented below.\nAlex Rowell is a research associate for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress.

{{Deb Haaland\u2019s New Mexico candidacy aims to change US politics and take on Donald Trump\nDeb Haaland, the former New Mexico state Democratic party chair who is seeking to make history as the first Native American woman elected to Congress, had just one question before running: could she win?\nYes, she thought, she absolutely could.\n\u201cAs a 35th-generation New Mexican, I felt I had a lot at stake,\u201d Haaland said in an interview at a coffee shop near the US Capitol in Washington. \u201cSo I decided to run.\u201d\nHaaland is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe and one of a record number of Native American women running for office this year. None have served in Congress \u2013 and the possibility of a landmark election is galvanizing voters in New Mexico.\n\u201cCongress has never heard a voice like mine,\u201d Haaland says in a campaign ad that emphasizes her working-class background and progressive platform.\nLast month, she soundly defeated five Democratic opponents to win the primary for an open congressional seat in a district that includes Albuquerque, the state\u2019s largest city.\n'Trump doesn't understand history': Native Americans tell their story in DC Read more\nIn November, she will face the Republican Janice Arnold-Jones, a former state lawmaker, and Lloyd Princeton, a Libertarian candidate, in a general election race that is expected to center on immigration, healthcare \u2013 and Donald Trump.\n\u201cTrump has given many people the courage to be bold in their racism. He gives the white supremacists and the far-right folks cause to be,\u201d she said.\nThe president, Haaland says, is completely ignorant of Native Americans\u2019 place in the country\u2019s history. His repeated attacks on the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he mockingly refers to as \u201cPocahontas\u201d, are \u201cdisgusting and disgraceful\u201d, she said. At a recent rally in Montana, Trump mused that he might \u201ctoss\u201d a DNA test at the Massachusetts senator, challenging her claims to Native American ancestry.\n\u201cFirst of all, he doesn\u2019t get to decide who\u2019s native,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cAnd it is extremely disrespectful for him to continue to use the name Pocahontas as a racial slur.\u201d\nBut she said Trump\u2019s policies, even more than his words, posed an urgent threat to Native American land and traditions. Haaland pointed to the administration\u2019s plan to enforce Medicaid work requirements for Native Americans, a move that tribal leaders say would restrict access to healthcare and undermine their sovereignty. She is also alarmed by the administration\u2019s decision to shrink national monuments and roll back federal land protections.\nThe daughter of military veterans, Haaland attended 13 schools before she graduated high school. To pay her way through college, she decorated cakes and started a salsa business. She earned a law degree while raising a daughter as a single mother and working part time at an antique auction shop. At times, her family relied on food stamps, a reality she said many New Mexicans face as the state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.\n\u2018As a 35th-generation New Mexican, I felt I had a lot at stake.\u2019 Photograph: Russell Contreras/AP\nA longtime activist, who protested the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock and marched with women in Washington, Haaland is running on a progressive platform that includes Medicare for All, a $15 federal minimum wage and universal childcare and pre-K. She also supports calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and to impeach Trump.\nIf she wins, Haaland says her top priorities in Washington would be protecting the environment and growing a clean energy economy. She would also fight for more funding and resources to combat violence against women, a scourge that disproportionately affects Native women.\nHer Republican opponent says voters in the district are more pragmatic than progressive \u2013 and that Haaland\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d positions on border security, oil and gas, and abortion will alienate moderates there.\n\u201cQuite frankly, the Democratic primary made this a very different election,\u201d Arnold-Jones said. \u201cMy opponent is much further left than the district.\u201d\nPolitical analysts view it as safely Democratic. Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 16 percentage points and Democrats have held the seat since 2009.\nArnold-Jones anticipates Democrats will try to tie her to Trump, but she believes the president\u2019s popularity is on the upswing in New Mexico thanks to a growing economy and the GOP tax cut plan.\n\u201cIt has taken a little bit of time for the state to warm up to him but the result of his policies have been exceptionally positive,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI actually think if the election were held today, the president would win.\u201d\nHaaland is part of a broader trend of Native Americans increasingly running for national office, after centuries of systematic persecution, marginalization and disenfranchisement.\nThe United States did not grant citizenship to Native people until 1924. But New Mexico, where Native Americans represent nearly 11% of the state population, did not fully enfranchise them until 1962. There are currently only two members of Congress who are Native American: the Oklahoma Republicans Tom Cole and Markwayne Mullin.\n\u201cSince 1789, we haven\u2019t been able to elect a single Native American woman to Congress,\u201d said Mark Trahant, the editor of Indian Country Today. \u201cThat it could finally happen is incredibly important.\u201d\nPartly driven by opposition to Trump and the #MeToo moment, dozens of Native American women are running for local, statewide and congressional office this year, a cohort that far outpaces past cycles, said Trahant, who is tracking the data.\nIt remains possible Haaland won\u2019t be the only Native American female elected to Congress this year. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk nation, is running in a competitive Democratic primary in a swing district in Kansas, and Amanda Douglas, a member of the Cherokee nation, advanced to a runoff election in the Democratic primary for a deeply conservative Oklahoma congressional district.\nUnlike many of the female candidates running for office in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, this is far from Haaland\u2019s first foray into politics. She worked for years in Democratic politics before an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. She then served as the state party chair.\nThe US government should cede territory back to Native Americans | Timothy Snyder Read more\nThe historic nature of Haaland\u2019s candidacy probably helped distinguish her in a race with little divergence on policy, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. He recalled that New Mexicans elected the Republican Susana Martinez after she reminded voters that she would be \u201cthe nation\u2019s first Hispanic female governor\u201d.\n\u201cPeople like to make history. I don\u2019t think that should be underestimated,\u201d he said.\nBut Haaland\u2019s primary success was not a marginal one, Monahan added. She sailed past her opponents in what was expected to be a competitive race by turning out a coalition of progressive voters that agreed with her on issues such as climate and healthcare.\nIn a Democratic district, she is positioned favorably ahead of the general election. A victory in November would seal her place in American history.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really hit me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut every now and then I\u2019ll get a sense from someone else and it makes me emotional because I realize that, for some people, they never thought they would see someone like them in Congress.\u201d\n}}
{{The jobs report for May brought the US unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent. Meanwhile, the number of people not in the labor force \u2013 which includes those unemployed Americans who have stopped looking for work after months or years if discouragement \u2013 remains near an all-time-high of 88 million. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average is struggling to remain above 12,000. The message is clear: This recovery from the Great Recession is still fragile.\nTo be fair, some of the reasons are outside the control of American policymakers \u2013 chiefly, the persistence of the European sovereign debt crisis. However, the inability to generate sustained growth is also the result of some fundamental weaknesses in the economy that policymakers could be addressing \u2013 but aren\u2019t.\nRecent reforms aimed at revival \u2013 like the payroll tax cut, stimulus, and international trade agreements \u2013 certainly have brought some benefit. Notwithstanding, they have mostly just nibbled around the edges.

{{Asian-American and Pacific Islander members of Congress have requested a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss the issues that most affect their communities, while voicing their extreme concern over anti-Muslim discrimination.\nThe Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, which advocates for AAPI issues, sent a letter to Trump last week, citing immigration, civil rights and education as some of the critical topics the group wants to discuss.\nThe demands are straightforward: No Muslim registry, no mass deportations, keep the legal immigration system in place and reform it if necessary, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), the caucus\u2019 chair, told The Huffington Post.\nChu said her primary objective right now is to ask Trump not to establish any system that would unfairly discriminate against Muslims, such as a registry, which the president-elect said he supports.\n\u201cThis would be a serious invasion of Muslim-American civil liberties in this country,\u201d Chu said. \u201cMuch like how the Japanese were the target of the internment camp experience. They lost their civil liberties due to fear, hysteria and accusations of espionage. We cannot have that happen again.\u201d\nThis would be a serious invasion of Muslim-American civil liberties in this country. Much like how the Japanese were the target of the internment camp experience ... We cannot have that happen again.\nA Trump surrogate recently suggested the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II serves as a \u201cprecedent\u201d for a national Muslim registry. And during the campaign, Trump suggested that he himself might have supported imprisoning Japanese-Americans at the time.\nTrump\u2019s transition team has denied the president-elect\u2019s support for a Muslim registry, though a video from the campaign trail last year in Iowa shows him detailing how a Muslim registry would involve \u201cgood management\u201d and how he would \u201csign them up at different places.\u201d\nTrump has also mentioned the Philippines and other countries with large Muslim populations as potential targets for immigration bans.\n\u201cWe need to express our grave concerns on an outright ban on a country like the Philippines,\u201d Chu said.\nChu also expressed other preoccupations about immigration as it relates to Asian-Americans. From 2000 to 2013, Asian undocumented immigration increased 202 percent, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The number of undocumented immigrants from China and India now exceeds the population coming from Mexico and Central America, MPI reports.\nChu pointed out that Asian students make up about 40 percent of all undocumented students in the University of California system \u2015 which comprises 10 schools, including UCLA and UC Berkeley.\nEliminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, authorized under President Barack Obama, could put those students and others at risk of deportation, Chu noted. DACA has prevented 700,000 young people who came to the U.S. illegally as children from being forced to leave the country. But that could change as Trump vows to \u201ccancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\u201d\nEducation is another issue Chu said she wishes to discuss with Trump. Southeast Asians have the highest dropout rates in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. Forty percent of Hmong, 38 percent of Laotian and 35 percent of Cambodian students do not complete high school, the White House reported.\nWhat\u2019s more, about 1 in 10 Hmong, Laotian, and Cambodian-Americans are out of work, according to The Asian American Center for Advancing Justice. That\u2019s higher than the unemployment rate for Latinos and similar to that of black workers.\nThese particular Asian-American populations also face poverty rates as high as 38 percent, the White House reports.\nChu said she wants Trump to understand the need for disaggregated data and to recognize that the model minority myth \u2015 the belief that all Asians are high achieving \u2015 is just that: a myth. Otherwise, vulnerable Asian-American populations could miss out on critical resources and programs.\nThere is a stereotype that all Asians are a model minority when it comes to education. But those from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, have the highest dropout rate in the U.S.\nChu also said she was concerned about efforts to repeal or amend the Affordable Care Act. Before the heath care law was implemented, 15.7 percent of the Asian-American population was uninsured, according to the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum. As of last year, that had decreased to 7.8 percent \u2015 the largest change for any racial or ethnic group. The Obama administration also facilitated registration by providing language assistance for those who needed it.\nAbout 2.7 million Asian-Americans could be at risk of losing access to health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the AAPI Health Forum estimates.\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n}}

(Lynn Lin/The Epoch Times)\nFirst Chinese-American WWII Vets Recognized With Congressional Gold Medal\nElsie Seetoo was 25-years-old when she joined the U.S. Army Nurse Corps in China to help the American forces in WWII.\nLast September, Seetoo celebrated her 100th birthday.\nIn late January, the centenarian was one of five Chinese-American WWII veterans to be awarded with the Congressional Gold Medal during a ceremony held at the Department of Veteran Affairs in Washington D.C on Jan. 29.\n\u201cYour service to our nation \u2026 has been most amazing and wonderful, and the honor due to you now through the Congressional Gold Medal is well overdue,\u201d said Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the ceremony.\nThe honorees were the first Chinese-American veterans to be formally recognized with the highest civilian honor of the United States as part of an effort to honor nearly 20,000 Chinese-Americans who served for the U.S. military in WWII.\nIn December, President Donald Trump signed the Chinese-American World War II Veterans Congressional Gold Medal Act into law, after it was unanimously passed by both houses of Congress. The law was passed as a result of a campaign spearheaded by the Chinese American WWII Veterans Recognition Project, a program of the National Chinese American Citizens Alliance.\nShowing America\u2019s Gratitude\nSeetoo was the oldest and highest-ranked veteran to be honored at the ceremony.\nBorn in California, Seetoo and her family moved back to Xinhui in China\u2019s southern Guangdong province when she was a teenager.\nAfter high-school, Seetoo trained to become a nurse in Hong Kong. In 1942, she walked 700 miles from Hong Kong to the city of Guiyang in southwest China to join the Chinese Red Cross Medical Relief Corps, where she worked in the operating room before becoming a medical trainer.\nIn 1944, she joined the U.S. Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant. She became a member of the Air Service Command to the 14th Air Force, successor to the famed \u201cFlying Tigers,\u201d commanded by Major General Claire Chennault. She was also assigned to hospitals in the cities of Kunming, Chengdu, and Shanghai.\nSeetee returned to the United States after the war and settled in Washington D.C. after being discharged from the Army. With her husband Joseph Yuen, they raised four children, seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.\nJames Eng, Harry Jung, Henry Lee, and Robert Lee were also honorees at the ceremony, and were recognized by Veteran\u2019s Affairs Acting Deputy Secretary James Byrne, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on behalf of the White House for their service.\n\u201cThey are heroic reminders that Asian-Americans are contributing to every part of mainstream America,\u201d said Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao.\n\u201cToday is a little step in showing America\u2019s gratitude for all that you have done for us.\u201d\nJames Eng, 95, was also recognized at the ceremony. He was a petty officer in the U.S. Navy and was stationed in San Diego Naval Station, controlling the base\u2019s radio station during the war.

The law was not repealed until the Magnuson Act in 1943.\nAbout 40 percent served without citizenship, according to the Veterans Recognition Project.\nUp until last December, Chinese-Americans were the only minority group not recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for their service during WWII.\nOut of the approximately 18,000 Chinese-American WWII veterans, only about 50 are alive today, according to E.

{{It has come to my attention that some members of the Arizona community are \u201cwarning\u201d us that all Muslims are a threat to the United States.\nSuch an assertion is false on its face! There are many Muslims who are loyal Americans. I will cite but one example of the many I know. I preface the discussion by pointing out that I am a Jew. And I am a Jew speaking out against this slander of lumping all Muslims together as \u201cenemies.\u201d\nThe one example I will cite is my very dear friend and my personal physician, Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser.\nJasser served honorably in the U.S. Navy for more than a decade. During part of that service, he was assigned at Bethesda Naval Hospital as chief resident in internal medicine. Following his service at the primary hospital of the Navy, for the next two years he was assigned to the Office of the Attending Physician to Congress (OAP). That office, with its clinic inside the U.S. Capitol Building, provides medical care for members of both houses of the legislative branch and to members of the Supreme Court.\nI suggest that Congress and the Supreme Court do not ask for just any doctor to be assigned to the OAP. I suggest that they demand the best physicians available.\nI, a Jew, happily put my life in the hands of a Syrian Muslim (American Muslim of Syrian extraction) who I know to be more loyal to the United States than those who want to paint him with a brush of bigotry.\nJasser is but one example out of many I could cite.

{{Following is the written version of my part in a five-member panel\u2019s presentation to the House\u2019s Homeland Security Committee on 9 October 2013. I ran late on 8 October 2013 and so failed to provide the committee\u2019s members with a typed-up version of my opening statement before the hearing. I submitted it to them on 10 October 2013.\nAs things turned out, my tardiness did not really matter. The committee\u2019s Chairman was knowledgeable, polite, and interested in what each panel member had to say, agreeing with some and challenging others. The rest of the Committee \u2014 at least those who showed up \u2014 was a train wreck or ignorance, arrogance, partisanship, and incompetence.\nThe Democratic members used most of their allotted time to chastise the Republicans for the government\u2019s shutdown. The three Republicans who spoke to me \u2014 especially one from New York \u2014 had no interest in what I said about the growing certainty that the Islamists\u2019 war soon will be fought, in part, in North America. Instead, the Republicans used most of their time to satisfy their AIPAC paymasters by praising and defending Israel, for whom they have what Alexander Hamilton would describe as a \u201cwomanish attachment.\u201d\nOne lad from South Carolina also added a short homily on how the religion of Moses and Abraham made the United States and Israel one and the same. And another fellow from Utah was bent on getting me to name the names of people at the CIA who know what is blisteringly obvious to all but the 535 members of Congress \u2014 that our ties to Israel are a clear and increasingly mortal threat to U.S. security, its economy, and the lives of Americans because it is one of the central motivations of our Islamist enemies. I refused to play ball. Utah\u2019s contemporary version of Tail-gunner Joe McCarthy also added that he \u201cknows\u201d all Muslims hate all Americans, their freedoms, and women\u2019s rights and that is why they are attacking us. He must have been briefed by that preacher from South Carolina, or by Senators Graham and McCain, the Knesset members masquerading as U.S. Senators.[1]\nFinally, in what has been a genuine and touching surprise, I have received several dozen e-mails from Americans who said they appreciated what I had to say to the committee. I want to thank them publicly for their kind words, and say that while they encourage me to continue speaking out, I must confess that I think there is little hope of preventing combat against Islamist forces in the United States in the years ahead. The quite large Homeland Security Committee probably is a pretty good microcosm of the attitudes of both the House and the Senate on these issues, and, if this judgment is correct, most of these ladies and gentlemen do not give a damn about the safety of American lives and property here at home.\nIndeed, after listening to some of the members of this committee, as well as to the last three presidents and many others in Congress and the media for the last fifteen years, it seems likely that many would silently welcome attacks in the United States so they could say \u201cwe and Israel are now in the same boat.\u201d They then could go on with their daily businesses of war, taxing, and graft as usual.\nWhat this means for Americans is that time is running out, and that there is every reason for them to exercise their rights under the 2nd Amendment as soon and as fully as possible. It seems likely that within the foreseeable future Americans will be called to defend themselves against Islamist fighters and/or an oppressive federal government that too-late sees that its deliberate lies about Islamist motivation, its willingness to facilitate U.S. military defeat overseas, its failure to control U.S. borders, and its groveling to Israel and the Saudi police-state have combined to bring war to our shores and that the only response it has is severe martial law\u2014better known as tyranny.\nOne hopes that Phillip Bobbitt was right in his fine new book about Machiavelli\u2019s thought when he argues that, in times when a republic\u2019s leaders \u201cbecome unsuitable,\u201d one of the great strengths of a republic lies in \u201cthe ruthlessness of the public, which can replace its leaders according to the demands of circumstances.\u201d[2]\nNotes\n[1] http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/hearing-al-shabaab-al-nusra-how-westerners-joining-terror-groups-overseas-affect-homeland\n[2] Phillip Bobbitt.

From the 1980s through today, U.S. Muslim citizens who go overseas to fight jihad return to America with several attributes, some old and some knew, but all strongly held.\nThey return home, of course, with the same religious faith that motivated to travel abroad to fight, but it will be strengthened by the simple fact that they were on the winning side.\nSince 1996, America has been engaged in what is preeminently a religious war for those who are waging it, not withstanding the deliberately misleading protests against this reality by our last three presidents.\nThat American Muslim fighters have traveled, fought, survived, won, and returned home safely proves two things to themselves, their families, and their religious communities: God was pleased by their actions and ensured they were successful. And for the younger people in the U.S. Muslim community \u2014 especially for young males \u2014 they will become role models in terms of an individual fulfilling his religious responsibility to defend Islam.\nThey also will return with increased talent in the use of small arms and explosives \u2014 a teachable talent \u2014 and with increased skills at building covert organizations. They will likewise return with confidence that victory is possible. They and their colleagues know that they inflicted humiliating defeats on the U.S. and NATO militaries in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that knowledge will boost morale and recruitment.\nFinally, the American fighters will return with a greatly enhanced knowledge of and contacts with other similarly minded men from across the Muslim world. All of the jihads to which American Muslims travel are fought by locals and an assortment of other men from countries that span the globe. The Americans will come home fully aware that the movement bin Laden started and led is now truly international in scope, and is quickly growing in numbers and geographical reach. They also will come home with a list of contacts among their fellow mujahedin from whom they can seek advice or more material forms of assistance.\n(3) As I noted at the start, the subject of our discussion today is about a phenomenon that is nearly 40 years old. It is clearly more dangerous today than ever before, but the factors that cause the problem \u2014 the factors that motivate young Muslim Americans to jihad \u2014 have been the same over time.\nAnd while there are a number of factors that motivate these young people \u2014 including Saudi-sponsored and funded religious education in the United States, and the bonds of family, clan, tribe, and nationalism that remain strong and vibrant even after immigration \u2014 the first and most important motivation for these American Muslims to go to war is the bipartisan and interventionist foreign policy of the U.S. government and the existence of Israel and numerous un-Islamic tyrannies in the Arab world, all supported by the United States.\nIndeed, since Laden declared war on America in 1996, al-Qaeda and its allies have had \u2014 from their perspective \u2013only two indispensable allies: Allah and U.S. and Western interventionism.\n(4) To conclude my opening statement, I would say that while what American Muslim mujahedin bring back with them from jihad is important, what they find in the United States upon returning is will be much more important in motivating what I believe will become combat situations \u2014 like the recent event in Nairobi and others much worse \u2014 in the United States over the next decade.\nAnd what they will find on their return will be a steady-as-she-goes interventionist U.S. foreign policy which has been a constant for more than thirty years.\nWe will be continuing to unquestionably arm, support, and justify Israel.\nWe will continue to support tyranny in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Algeria, and elsewhere in the Muslim world.\nWe will continue preaching democracy but stand ready to immediately intervene to undermine fairly elected governments in places like Palestine and Egypt.\nAnd certainly most dangerous for U.S. national security, we will continue to prosecute the clash of civilizations, initiated by President Bush and accelerated by President Obama and Mrs. Clinton, designed to impose secularism, democracy, and women\u2019s rights on an Islamic world ready and willing to fight forced Westernization to the death.\nIn terms of the length of our war with Islam, this attempt to teach our little, brown Muslim brothers to be just like us will lengthen the war every bit as much as the unprovoked and unnecessary military interventions in Libya, Mali, and Iraq.\n(5) And if you think that I place too much emphasis on the motivation provided to U.S. citizens and other Western mujahedin by U.S. and Western interventionism, I would draw your attention to the reality that, to the best of my knowledge, neither we nor any of our NATO partners have yet to capture a Western Islamist fighter whose words or documents have shown a motivation to attack based on hatred for liberty, elections, or gender equality. Invariably, they attribute their motivation to U.S. and Western military intervention in the Islamic world and U.S. and Western support for Israel and various Muslim tyrannies.\n}}
{{When educators who are identified as professors from prestigious universities testify before Congress, write op-eds, and appear on public or media sponsored panels, most readers and listeners value their words more than those of others less credentialed. Perhaps this is especially the case when the subject is foreign affairs, which \u2014 without warrant \u2014 is generally treated as an arcane subject requiring considerable specialized study to fully comprehend.\nFor this reason, concern is growing that our universities, especially those highly regarded, have been receiving very large sums of cash from abroad, often from countries or citizens of countries which hold positions antithetical to our interests or engage in conduct shocking to our values. This matter is receiving critical attention from both sides of the political spectrum.\nThe fact of these large gifts is no secret. 20 USC 1011-Sec. 1011f requires colleges and universities to disclose foreign donations and contracts valued at $250,000 or more, and the Department of Education annually posts them online on its website.\nToday, the Chronicle of Higher Education published an article by Scott Carlson on the subject (subscription only). Reviewing the latest such report from the DOE (the next is due next month), he notes:\nOver the past 10 years, gifts from and contracts with governments, companies, and individuals [in the Middle East] have amounted to more than $600 million.\nQatar is the largest contributor, donating almost half of the total. It is followed by Saudi Arabia, which donated $77 million. I suspect that with the downturn in the American economy these large foreign gifts are being more aggressively sought out and constitute a larger and larger portion of university revenues.\nHow much of this is known to alumni and students is unclear. If you recall, the videos of the NPR fundraisers (both former university fundraisers) and the make-believe Arabs revealed that they were very willing to do what they could to keep the proposed gift anonymous. They said they had done this before, and even mentioned an $80 million dollar gift \u2014 apparently from a domestic giver with a feminist bent \u2014 to a number of universities which had successfully been kept under wraps by all the schools concerned. I suspect that a great deal of the foreign funding, though reported as the law requires to the federal government, may not be fully known in university communities.\nIn any event, word is getting out. As Carlson observes, the initial complaints came from conservatives and those who support Israel, but now the left \u2014 which is expressing concern about human rights issues \u2014 has joined in. Some of the most well-publicized of these disputes here and in the UK involve unseemly conduct on the part of university officials, but incidents which undermine scholarship are not as well-known.\nWe may know of Lawrence Tech's grant of a doctorate to Bahrain's prime minister, who in turn donated $3 million to the university; or we may know of the scandal at the London School of Economics \u2014 the university trained Libyan officials and granted an apparently unearned doctorate to one of the dictator's sons. (Subsequently, it was learned that Michigan State was also training Gaddafi's men, and prominent Harvard professors \u2014 through a public relations firm of their creation, Monitor \u2014 were hiring professors in part to burnish the dictator's image.) However, although these incidents have had higher profiles, I believe these acts are far less insidious and detrimental to our interests and to the universities' basic functions than is so much else that this largesse creates on a regular, lower-profile basis.\nFirst, these gifts cannot but distort the research and classroom work of a university. Professors, universities, and the entire university food chain (graduate students, assistant professors, students) all know who has money, and naturally gravitate to those studies and projects for which there is funding. If there is no money to support research in a given area, there can be no fellowships or grants to sustain the scholarship. So teachers read, teach, and write about topics for which funding is available, and students make such topics the object of their study. Time is a scarce resource even in the groves of academe, and smart people do not wish to waste theirs pursuing subjects for which there will be no ability to finance and publicize their endeavors.\nSecond, can one doubt that there will be a tendency not to offend the donors? It's possible that Stephen Walt (professor of international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government), a man who was hired to tart up Gaddafi in the public view, might have written this drivel on his own without the money, but one doubts it despite his strong anti-Israel, pro-Arab views:\nFirst, although Libya is far from a democracy, it also doesn't feel like other police states that I have visited. I caught no whiff of an omnipresent security service \u2014 which is not to say that they aren't there \u2014 and there were fewer police or military personnel on the streets than one saw in Franco's Spain. The Libyans with whom I spoke were open and candid and gave no sign of being worried about being overheard or reported or anything like that. The TV in my hotel room featured 50+ channels, including all the normal news services (BBC World Service, CNN, MSNBC, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, etc.) along with contemporary U.S. sitcoms like \"2-1/2 Men,\" shows like \"Desperate Housewives,\" assorted movies, and one of the various \"CSI\" clones. A colleague on the trip told me that many ordinary Libyans have satellite dishes and that the government doesn't interfere with transmissions. I tried visiting various political websites from my hotel room and had no problems, although other human rights groups report that Libya does engage in selective filtering of some political websites critical of the regime. It is also a crime to criticize Qaddafi himself, the government's past human rights record is disturbing at best, and the press in Libya is almost entirely government-controlled. Nonetheless, Libya appears to be more open than contemporary Iran or China and the overall atmosphere seemed far less oppressive than most places I visited in the old Warsaw Pact.\nBenjamin R. Barber, then a senior fellow at Demos (a New York-based think tank focused on the theory and practice of democracy) and now at Rutgers, was also hired by the Harvard-related group to buff up the Libyans. He wrote this bit of treacle:\nWritten off not long ago as an implacable despot, Gaddafi is a complex and adaptive thinker as well as an efficient, if laid-back, autocrat. Unlike almost any other Arab ruler, he has exhibited an extraordinary capacity to rethink his country's role in a changed and changing world.\nOn the other hand, Joseph Nye of Harvard's Kennedy School didn't act as a Gaddafi promoter. Upon returning from a trip to Libya, he disclosed his consulting arrangement with Monitor and reported critically on what he saw there. It could well be that the funders \u2014 like those who fund two Georgetown University centers run by Professors John L. Esposito and Michael Hudson, two men instinctively critical of the U.S. and Israel and indulgent of the Arabs \u2014 are often merely putting money in the pockets of those who already take their side, and are not buying their approval. Mutual attraction, not prostitution, may explain the grants on one side and the product on the other.\nStill, by funding these professors the donors are assuring that these professors gain power and prominence within their university and the academic community.\nThis problem is not confined to foreign gifts. Those who follow the latest politically popular trends \u2014 like global warming \u2014 get funded by the government; those academics skeptical of it do not. Similarly, when the Annenberg Foundation funds went from that foundation, through Obama, to Bill Ayers, Ayers' power within the University of Illinois undoubtedly increased, along with his sway in the national educational establishment itself. Still, the notion of foreign governments, especially those who pose national security issues for this nation, buying up or paying off like-minded professors or directing undue scholarship towards a benign reading of matters in their interest is especially troubling.\nAside from monitoring what information is made public, is there anything else that can be done? I think a first step would be for universities to adopt a code of conduct, requiring professors who speak publicly before Congress, in the media, and before public audiences to disclose any foreign funding of which they are the recipients. This hardly seems to be asking a great deal. I believe it is a policy in ordinary use respecting scientific research \u2014 I can't see why this policy merits objection from academia. Increasingly the public is used to and demanding transparency in all our institutions \u2014 why should universities and those who run them and work there be exempt? They have a unique ability to shape public opinion, and with that comes a special obligation to be candid about who's footing the bills.\n}}
{{CHARLESTOWN, Nevis \u2014 A multitude of opportunities for Nevis to develop the island\u2019s geothermal energy were presented during the Fifth Geothermal Congress for Latin America and the Caribbean (GEOLAC) 2018 held in Mexico City, according to Wakely Daniel, Permanent Secretary in the Premier\u2019s Ministry on Nevis.\n\u201cThe forum proved worthwhile and beneficial and paved the way for networking,\u201d Daniel told the Department of Information on his return to Nevis. \u201cMost of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have embarked on a geothermal project attended that conference and the networking itself was quite helpful.\n\u201cWe had a chance to look at the experiences that all of these countries would have had,\u201d he said. \u201cWe looked at their pitfalls, all of the challenges and at times, looking at the process. It even proved to be a cautionary tale for those of us who are new in the process or who are in the final stages, as we are, in geothermal.\u201d\nAt the event, Daniel represented Hon. Mark Brantley, Premier of Nevis and Minister of Public Utilities and Energy. Daniel explained that he was also able to interact with representatives of key institutions including the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) that could help to Nevis in its geothermal endeavour.\n\u201cWe looked at the process in Nevis, what\u2019s happening here, how they can assist and I\u2019ve advised the premier about ways in which he, as the minister, can communicate to these institutions and how they are willing and able to assist Nevis as we embark upon the geothermal process,\u201d he said.\nThe Permanent Secretary, accompanied by Jervan Swanston, Acting General Manager of the Nevis Electricity Company Limited (NEVLEC), was among delegates who made presentations at the Mexico City forum.\nHe noted that he also used the opportunity to speak about the geothermal project in Nevis, its timeline, what has already been accomplished, the status and the future projections.\nDaniel reiterated the NIA\u2019s stance on the importance of geothermal energy development to Nevis, which in the end would revolutionise the island\u2019s economy.\nThe congress, which is co-hosted by the IADB and the World Bank Group with support from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Energy (SENER), is the only gathering of the region\u2019s leading geothermal stakeholders.\nThe forum was launched in 2012. It brings together public, private and multilateral stakeholders for two days of intensive networking and discussion on the prospects for investment in geothermal region-wide.\nThis year, the forum was the largest since its inception, with 150 stakeholders from 30 countries and 13 regional governments represented by senior officials.\n}}
{{Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), speaks at a hearing on human rights in China July 1, 2017. (Leo Shi/The Epoch Times)\nCongress Introduces New Bill to Counter Beijing\u2019s Political Influence in America\nMeasure would require Confucius Institutes to register as foreign agents\nWASHINGTON\u2014As the Chinese regime continues to invest heavily in overseas political influence and propaganda operations, a new bill introduced in Congress explicitly seeks to curb such interference.\nThe \u201cCountering the Chinese Government and Communist Party\u2019s Political Influence Operations Act of 2018\u201d was introduced on June 4 by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nSmith is also the co-chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which has been leading the charge to highlight the Chinese regime\u2019s influence in America and its consequences.\nThe bill would require U.S. intelligence agencies to provide a detailed report on Beijing\u2019s influence operations in America, both covert and overt. It also calls for developing a long-term strategy to counter Beijing\u2019s political influence, censorship, propaganda, and disinformation targeting the United States.\nThe June 4 date was intentionally chosen to coincide with the 29th anniversary of the Chinese regime\u2019s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square in 1989.\nSmith said in a statement that the United States needs to better understand the \u201cmalign goals of China\u2019s political influence operations,\u201d while stressing the need to distinguish such undesirable elements from the \u201ccultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges which benefit both the American and Chinese people.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chinese government and Communist Party use both overt and covert means to target the political and economic elite, the media and public opinion, civil society and academia, and members of the Chinese diaspora,\u201d the draft bill says.\nThe bill would require Chinese regime-funded Confucius Institutes located on American university and college campuses to register as foreign agents, a requirement that has been proposed before and supported by many, including in legislation introduced in March by Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).\nRubio, among the most outspoken critics of the Chinese regime\u2019s authoritarian influence, is expected to sponsor legislation in the Senate similar to Smith and Kaptur\u2019s bill, a congressional aide said.\nAnother Senate bill titled \u201cStop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act of 2018\u201d was introduced on May 22 by Sen. Ted Cruz (R. TX) with similar goals in mind, although it did not specifically name Confucius Institutes nor China.\n\u201cCommunist China is infiltrating American universities to meddle with our curricula, silence criticism of their regime, and steal intellectual property including sensitive dual-use research,\u201d Cruz said in a statement. \u201cThe Confucius Institutes are the velvet glove around the iron fist of their campaigns on our campuses. The American government needs new tools to protect the integrity of our universities and research, and to block academic espionage.\u201d\nCruz\u2019s bill would allow the FBI to designate an entity as a \u201cforeign intelligence threat to higher education\u201d and then require U.S. colleges and universities to follow strict reporting and disclosure rules for any financial interactions with designated foreign entities.\nVarious members of the U.S. Congress in recent months have made statements or sent letters asking colleges and universities in their states to cut ties or end relations with Confucius Institutes on their respective campuses.\nPreviously, top U.S. intelligence officials have publicly warned that Confucius Institutes and other propaganda platforms in the Chinese regime\u2019s toolkit are being used to influence American society. The FBI has been investigating numerous Confucius Institutes around the country, according to Director Christopher Wray.\nIn a Congressional hearing, Wray also said that the Chinese regime has manipulated nontraditional spies, especially those in academic settings, such as professors, scientists, and students, to steal U.S. technology and secrets.\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is view the China threat\u2014it\u2019s not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end, and I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us,\u201d Wray said.\nThe Chinese regime\u2019s decade\u2019s long attempt to influence the politics of other nations has been under dramatically increased scrutiny since 2017. Countries around the world have begun awakening to the painful realization that the doors they willingly opened to China for trade and cultural exchange have let in the Chinese regime\u2019s encroachments on their political institutions and way of life.\nSuch interference was particularly felt in Australia and New Zealand, as media there recently delivered a series of high-profile investigative reports and headline stories about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s control and influence over political candidates, businesses, and academia, as well as the Chinese students across Oceania.\nIn the United States, Democrats have given much less attention to Chinese influence activities, compared to the Russian influence operations targeting the 2016 U.S. election. However, Kaptur\u2019s co-sponsorship of the bill countering the Chinese regime\u2019s political influence operations is a sign that Democrats are beginning to recognize the threat posed by China.\n}}

But allegations of sexual assault \u2014 including riveting testimony by Christine Blasey Ford, whose statements alleging an attack at the hands of the jurist while they were in high school were beamed around the world Thursday \u2014 made some of Kavanaugh\u2019s ardent supporters step back. Kavanaugh, tapped by Trump for the open spot on the nation\u2019s highest court, also testified, adamantly denying the charges.\nIn a letter dated Thursday and addressed to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and ranking committee member Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, the bar association urged the Senate to delay a confirmation until \u201cafter an appropriate background check into the allegations made by Professor Ford and others is completed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d\nIn the note to the Judiciary Committee, bar association President Robert Carlson wrote: \u201cDeciding to proceed without conducting additional investigation would not only have a lasting impact on the Senate\u2019s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the Supreme Court. It must remain an institution that will reliably follow the law and not politics.\u201d\nThe U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee votes on the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Sept. 28, 2018, a day after Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the federal judge of sexual misconduct while both were in high school, testified before the panel.\nEarlier this month, the bar association\u2019s Paul Moxley testified before the Judiciary Committee \u2014 responsible for vetting Supreme Court nominees \u2014 that Kavanaugh met \u201cthe highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.\u201d\nReached Friday, bar association representatives declined to elaborate.\n\u201cThe letter speaks for itself,\u201d spokesman Marc Davis said.\nkgalioto@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @katiegalioto\nMORE COVERAGE:\nAmid last minute drama, GOP advances Kavanaugh to full Senate vote; Flake calls for limited FBI probe \u00bb\nGov.

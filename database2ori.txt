{{Derick Lwugi, an accountant with the City of Calgary and member of a Canadian non-profit organization, has been confirmed as one of the 157 people killed in an Ethiopian Airlines plane crash on Sunday.\nLwugi\u2019s friend, Jody Nyakio, confirmed to Postmedia that he died in the crash and is survived by his wife and children. Lwugi was travelling to Kenya to visit the couple\u2019s parents.\n\u201cHis mom was not feeling well,\u201d Lwugi\u2019s wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary.\nThe couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home.\nThe family has lived in Calgary for 12 years.\nNyakio said she knew Lwugi when he lived in Toronto and he taught her to drive. She said she is \u201cstill in shock\u201d to learn of Lwugi\u2019s death, calling him \u201ca great man.\u201d\nLwugi was a board member of Abeingo Canada, an Ontario-based not-for-profit organization that seeks to economically empower members, who are predominantly Kenyan, through social support. On its website, Abeingo said Lwugi moved to Canada in 2004.\n\u201cDerick believes it is important to (give) back to society. He believes the emotional and psychological returns earned from helping the less fortunate are enormous,\u201d it reads.\nAn Edmonton mother and her young daughter, and a Carleton University professor were among the 18 Canadians who died when the Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed six minutes after takeoff from the Addis Ababa airport on its way to Nairobi, Kenya.\nLwugi formed the Kenyan Community Association in Calgary in 2008 and served as the group\u2019s first president until 2012, the website states. He also volunteered as an assistant pastor at the Trumpet Call International Ministries in Ogden, according to Abeingo.\nHe received a master\u2019s degree in accounting and business statistics and worked at the City of Calgary as a senior financial accountant.\nCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi offered his condolences on Twitter.\n\u201cAbsolutely crushed to learn that one of my (City of Calgary) colleagues, wonderful community leader Derick Lwugi, was amongst those killed in the plane crash this morning in Ethiopia. All our love to his family, friends, colleagues, and all those touched by his life of service,\u201d it read.\nThe crash happened Sunday morning shortly after takeoff from Bole International Airport in Ethiopia\u2019s capital. The plane went down 50 kilometres south of Addis Ababa at 8:44 a.m.\nRecords show the plane, a Boeing 737-8 MAX, was delivered to Ethiopian Airlines in mid-November. It is not yet clear what caused the crash.\nAmong the identified Canadians were Edmonton\u2019s Amina Ibrahim Odowaa, 33, and her five-year-old daughter, Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir, who were travelling to Kenya to visit with relatives. A family friend said Odowaa has lived in Edmonton since 2006.\nPius Adesanmi, a Nigerian-born professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University, was also killed.\nCarleton University president Benoit-Antoine Bacon said Adesanmi was \u201ca towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship.\u201d\nRelated\nAnwar Sultan, a community organizer in the Ethiopian community in Calgary, said they are deeply saddened to hear the news.\n\u201cIt is very saddening to hear that so many people, from so many different countries and nationalities, are affected by this,\u201d said Sultan. \u201cI don\u2019t have words to express how much hardship they are going through right now.\u201d\nHe said about 20,000 Ethiopians live in Calgary. So far, he has not learned of anyone in the community who is directly affected.\nSultan said he was speaking to community leaders to organize a vigil, or something similar, to honour those who died in the tragic crash.\n\u201cWe pray that they find a quick recovery from the mental and emotional impact from all of this.\u201d\n\u2014 With files from The Canadian Press\nMore to come \u2026\n}}

{{C-130 Hercules transporter fails minutes after taking off from air force base in Medan on island of Sumatra\nMore than 116 people are feared dead on Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra island after a military aeroplane careered into the side of a building and burst into flames just minutes after takeoff.\nTwelve crew members and 101 passengers, including military officers and family members, were on board the C-130 Hercules when it crashed after leaving an air force base in Medan, a city of two million.\nAir marshal Agus Supriatna told local Metro TV news that all 113 people on board died. \u201cNo, no. No survivors,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility, \u201cI just returned from the site.\u201d\nMany passengers were likely to be family members of servicemen and women, said a spokesman for Medan air base from where the plane departed. At least one child has been confirmed as dead.\nSearch and rescue officials said that three people were killed on the ground when the 51-year-old Hercules plane crashed two minutes after takeoff from the Soewondo air force base en route to drop off supplies to the Natuna Islands in the South China Sea. It went down near a newly built residential area, hitting a massage parlour and a small hotel.\nPolice and rescue teams had pulled 84 bodies from the wreckage by Tuesday night and transported them to Adam Malik general hospital in Medan to be identified.\nPolice said rescuers were still trying to get into the ruined massage parlour, a three-storey building, and they did not know whether there were people inside.\nDramatic pictures of the scene showed the wreckage of the aircraft in flames and a crowd of onlookers amid the plumes of thick smoke.\nGerry Soejatman (@GerryS) #BREAKING #IndonesianAirForce #C130 reg no. #A1310 crashed departing Medan Polonia otw Tanjung Pinang. pic.twitter.com\/Yh0dB3HWV1\n\u201cI saw the plane from the direction of the airport and it was tilting already, then I saw smoke billowing,\u201d said resident, Januar, 26.\nOther pictures showed the side of one building gutted by the impact of the crash and damage to nearby buildings and cars.\nThe commander of the Indonesian armed forces, General Moeldoko, has called for an investigation into the incident.\nAccording to Supriatna, the Hercules aircraft was conducting a routine logistics operation. Made in 1964, the marshal said the aircraft was well maintained and was regularly used to transport personnel.\nBut angry legislators from the Indonesian parliamentary commission on defence called on the government to replace its ageing military aircraft. Supriatna said the military was grounding some of its Hercules planes.\n\u201cWe in the commission ask the government to buy new planes for the air force,\u201d Pramono Aung told the Jakarta Post. \u201cThe current fleet is mostly made up of old, poor-quality aircraft. It\u2019s shameful that our soldiers still have to use them.\u201d\nThe disaster has once again shone a harsh light on Indonesia\u2019s poor aviation safety record. It came just six months after an AirAsia plane crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people on board.\nIt is the sixth fatal crash involving an Indonesian air force plane in the past decade, according to the Aviation Safety Network.\nIn the late 1990s and mid-2000s, a string of fatal aeroplane crashes in Indonesia was blamed on the US military embargo put in place because of human rights abuses perpetrated in East Timor.\nThe embargo forced the Indonesian military to seek spare parts for its hardware elsewhere and fly planes that were in poor condition, but the embargo was lifted a decade ago.\nIndonesian aviation analyst, Gerry Soejatman, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have an arms embargo so why is there a crash?\u201d. The hangars are full with those [aircraft] that are not airworthy ... The ones that are flying have to be kept airworthy. The air force is pretty strict about it now, as compared to 10 years ago.\u201d\nNo details have been released regarding whether mechanical or human error led to the crash, but a witness said the plane was emitting smoke from at least one of its engines.\nIn 2009, an Indonesian air force Hercules hit four houses before skidding into a rice field, killing 95 people on board and two on the ground, according to the Aviation Safety Network.\nIn December, an Airbus A320 run by AirAsia crashed on a flight from Indonesia to Singapore, killing all 162 people on board.\n}}

The ban was completely lifted in June this year. The U.S. lifted a decadelong ban in 2016.\n}}

{{The pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 were engaged in a futile tug-of-war with the plane's automatic systems in the minutes before it plunged into the ocean, killing all 189 people on board.\nBut investigators say they are at a loss to explain why the pilots didn't follow the same procedure performed by another flight crew the previous day when they encountered a similar issue.\nA preliminary report into the crash released Wednesday by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) reveals more details about the final moments of Flight 610, but acknowledges many questions remain.\nData retrieved from the flight recorder shows the pilots repeatedly fought to override an automatic safety system installed in the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane, which pulled the plane's nose down more than two dozen times.\nThe system was responding to faulty data, which suggested that the nose was tilted at a higher angle than it was, indicating the plane was at risk of stalling.\nAccording to the report, the pilots first manually corrected an \"automatic aircraft nose down\" two minutes after takeoff and performed the same procedure again and again before the plane hurtled nose-first into the Java Sea.\nCNN aviation analyst David Soucie said that the circumstances created by the plane's automatic correction would have made pilot intervention \"impossible.\"\n\"The fact that they fought against the MCAS (multiple) times with the trim settings was an impossible scenario to recover from,\" he said.\nProblem previously corrected\nA different flight crew had experienced the same issue on a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta the previous day, but had turned off the automatic safety feature, known as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) and took manual control of the plane.\nThe feature is new to Boeing's MAX planes and automatically activates to lower the nose to prevent the plane from stalling, based on information sent from its external sensors. Indonesian investigators have already pointed to issues with the plane's angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors, which had proved faulty on earlier flights.\nAoA sensors send information to the plane's computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air to help determine whether the plane is about to stall.\nResponding to the report, Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the loss of the Lion Air flight -- but maintained the 737 MAX 8 \"is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies,\" and that the company is \"taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this accident.\"\nWednesday's preliminary report recommends that Lion Air review its safety culture while the investigation continues, and while officials search for cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which is believed to be buried under mud on the ocean floor.\nIt should reveal what the pilots were saying and why they didn't turn off the safety feature.\n\"We need to know what was the pilot discussion during the flight. What was the problem that may heard on the CVR. So why the action difference, this is the thing we need to find. At the moment I don't have the answer,\" said the NTSC's head of aviation, Capt. Nurcahyo Utomo.\nIssue reported two minutes into flight\nThe preliminary report said Flight 610 reported a issues minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital on October 29 en route to the city of Pangkal Pinang, on the island of Bangka.\nWithin 90 seconds of takeoff, the co-pilot asked air traffic control to confirm air speed and altitude. Thirty seconds after that he reported that they had experienced a \"flight control problem,\" the report said.\nAfter the aircraft's flaps retracted following takeoff, the automatic trim problem noted on the previous night's flight returned, until the flight data recorder stopped recording when the plane crashed.\nThe report said the pilots on the plane's penultimate flight reported that instruments were showing inaccurate readouts from the angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors.\nThe report said that the plane was \"automatically trimming\" on the previous flight -- that is, the computer was adjusting the aircraft's angle -- so the pilots switched to manual trim and, as their safety checklists didn't recommend an emergency landing, they continued to Jakarta.\nFurther maintenance on the AoA sensor was carried out in Jakarta prior to Flight 610's takeoff the next morning. After the flight took off, the instruments recorded a substantial discrepancy in the aircraft's angle -- as much as 20 degrees.\nAviation expert Geoffrey Thomas called the report \"very comprehensive\" and said that he could not understand why Lion Air had deemed the plane suitable for service.\n\"Clearly the plane had serious sensor issues ... why the airplane wasn't pulled out of service beggars belief,\" he told CNN.\n\"Tinkering around and replacing parts isn't enough.\"\nAs part of the continued investigation, the faulty AoA sensor will undergo further testing, the NTSC said. It plans to finish its report within 12 months.\nCaptain's mother: Son said sim training unnecessary\nThe pilot's mother Sangeeta Suneja, herself a senior commercial manager with Air India, told CNN after a family briefing Tuesday that her son was \"a sunny boy. He was loved by everybody in his company.\"\nShe says her son, Capt. Bhavye Suneja told her there was no updated training simulation session when Lion Air started using the new aircraft.\n\"They said it was not required... When the transition happened, he said, 'Mama, I'm going to fly the MAX.' I said, 'How can you do that (when) you don't have (a) simulator session?' He said, 'We don't need to.'\"\nComing from an aviation family, she said that Suneja's sister wanted to follow in his footsteps, but that the fatal accident had shaken her faith in the technology.\n\"Even my daughter wants to be a pilot. She was so inspired by him she also wants to be a pilot,\" she said.\n\"Now I have apprehensions. I don't know. How safe it is. The trust in the machine is shaky now.\"\nShe added that air safety regulation across the world needed to be re-established to reaffirm people's trust in air travel.\n\"Whenever they (present new aircraft) to the market, where the life of the people is at stake, the regulators must re-establish three, or five, levels of crosscheck... Someone should have questioned this.\"\nComplaints about Boeing manual\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA) and Lion Air's operational director claim Boeing's operational manual for the MAX 8 did not contain adequate information about the MCAS system.\n\"We don't receive any information from Boeing or from (the) regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" Zwingli Silalahi, Lion Air's operational director told CNN on November 14. Both the pilot and co-pilot of Flight 610 were experienced , the airline has said, with 6,000 and 5,000 flight hours respectively.\nBoeing stood by the aircraft's safety record. \"We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe parents o f one passenger is suing Boeing, alleging the 737 MAX 8 had an unsafe design. The suit alleges Boeing failed to communicate a new safety feature that hadn't existed in previous 737s.\nBoeing released an operational bulletin on November 6 , a week after the crash, warning all airlines about how to address erroneous readings related to the plane's external sensors. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later issued its own directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems.\nEarlier this month, Indonesian investigators who examined the jet's flight data recorder said there were problems with the air speed indicator on the three flights before the crash.\nThe plane was intact with its engines running when it crashed, at more than 450 mph (720 kph), into the Java Sea, Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, said at the time.\nTjahjono said that due to the small size of the debris found and loss of the plane's engine blades, investigators determined that Flight 610 did not explode in the air, but was in \"good shape\" before it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff.\n}}

{{Investigators probing last month\u2019s EgyptAir jetliner crash say analysis of the plane\u2019s flight data recorder has revealed the presence of smoke in the cabin, while the wreckage bears evidence of soot and high temperatures.\nThe findings suggest that the May 19 tragedy, which killed all 66 people on board, involved some sort of fire and may indicate an electrical fault or other systems failure, though the investigators didn\u2019t say whether terrorism is now regarded as less likely to have been the cause.\nThe Airbus Group SE A320\u2019s data recorder indicates the presence of smoke in one of the lavatories and in the avionics bay, consistent with messages sent automatically by the jet\u2019s Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System before it went down, Egypt\u2019s civil-aviation ministry said in a statement.\nAt the same time, some of the wreckage recovered from the front section of the aircraft shows signs of high-temperature damage and soot, the ministry said. The sites where smoke was indicated are also in the jet\u2019s forward section, with the avionics bay located beneath the cockpit.\n\u201cAnalysis will be carried out to try to identify the source and reason for those signs,\u201d the statement said. The Egyptian government said soon after the loss of the plane en route from Paris to Cairo that terrorism was likely to blame.\nDavid Learmount, an air-safety expert and former Royal Air Force pilot, said the data confirms earlier findings but doesn\u2019t yet narrow down the theories.\n\u201cFrom the heat, damage and soot we know there was a fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know was what started it.

This is not conclusive, but it is something that points possibly in that direction, and at this point we feel that threshold has been crossed.\u201d\nThe \u201csafety notice\u201d means none of the aircraft \u2014 or a new version, the Max 9, which isn\u2019t as widely used \u2014 can fly into, out of, or over Canada, he added: \u201cI will not hesitate to take swift action should we discover any additional safety issues.\u201d\nGarneau tipped off his American counterparts just before the announcement about the Canadians\u2019 change of heart on the aircraft. Hours later, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would follow suit.\nTrump said he had told American airlines about the decision as well as Boeing and all agreed with his administration\u2019s decision. Any planes in the air will be grounded upon landing, and remain on the ground until further notice, Trump said, while Boeing works on a fix to the aircraft\u2019s software.\n\u201cThe safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,\u201d Trump said in announcing his decision.\nWhile aviation experts warn against drawing conclusions until more information emerges from the crash investigation, numerous jurisdictions, including China, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union, had grounded the Max 8 or banned it from their airspace before Canada and the U.S. did.\nGarneau said evidence about multiple Boeing 737 Max 8 flights suggests a worrying correlation between the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the tragedy in Indonesia less than five months ago. In certain circumstances, the planes\u2019 systems try to tilt their noses down, contrary to the efforts of pilots \u2014 a pattern that was seen in both flights before they crashed, he said.\n\u201cI would repeat once again that this is not the proof that this is the same root problem,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cIt could be something else.\u201d\nPassenger-rights advocate Gabor Lukacs said Wednesday that it would be prudent for Garneau to suspend use of the aircraft until questions are answered about what caused the Ethiopian crash.\n\u201cGenerally, one should always be erring on the side of caution when it comes to safety questions,\u201d he said from Halifax. \u201cIf there is enough evidence of a potential harm, and in this case I think there is evidence of potential harm, then the prudent thing is to ground those aircraft.\u201d\nHe said airlines should allow passengers to rebook on other planes or cancel their tickets without penalty if they have apprehensions about flying on a Max 8.\nGarneau said affected travellers should contact their airlines to find out what to do, he added.\n\u201cThere will be some disruption, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d he said, but safety is more important. He said he hopes the planes will be flying safely within weeks.\nIn a statement Wednesday, before the order from Transport Canada, Air Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur said the airline has a \u201cflexible rebooking policy\u201d that includes options to change flights to another aircraft if space permits, but wouldn\u2019t indicate if that comes with a fee.\n\u201cBased on real information and data, and ongoing consultations with government safety regulators including Transport Canada and the FAA, we have full confidence in the safety of our fleet and operations and we continue to operate the 737,\u201d she said in an email.\nCalgary-based WestJet Airlines said it is contacting all affected customers to arrange alternative travel plans.\n\u201cWe respect the decision made by Transport Canada and are in the process of grounding the 13 Max aircraft in our fleet,\u201d the company said in a statement late Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have 162 aircraft or more than 92 per cent of our overall fleet that remain in service.\u201d\nAir Canada, along with Southwest and American Airlines, had been the major outliers in resisting a grounding of the planes. Air Canada has 24 Max 8 aircraft (out of 184 in its main fleet), which it uses mainly for domestic and U.S. routes.\nAir Canada cancelled London-bound flights from Halifax and St. John\u2019s, N.L., after the United Kingdom banned all Boeing Max 8 jets from its airspace.\nThe U.S.-based Boeing had said it had no reason to pull the popular aircraft from the skies and did not intend to issue new recommendations about the aircraft to customers.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration had backed the jet\u2019s airworthiness before reversing course early Wednesday afternoon.\nGarneau said the American authority is \u201can extremely professional organization\u201d and Canada is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with it as a certifying agency for American makers\u2019 airplanes.\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:AC, TSX:WJA)\n\u2014 with files from Alison Auld in Halifax and the Associated Press\n}}

{{Balloonist in Alps crash phoned to say he was safe then fell to his death\nFather-of-six Bob Bickerdike lost his footing on the ice and fell to his death\nWhen his hot-air balloon crashed in the French Alps at 6,000ft, Bob Bickerdike was relieved just to have survived.\nHe called friends to tell them he was unharmed \u2013 and said he would walk to some chalets half a mile away that he had spotted.\nBut, tragically, as the 63-year-old pilot trekked along the mountainside, he lost his footing on the ice \u2013 and fell down a ravine to his death.\nMr Bickerdike, a father of six, was on a ballooning holiday in the mountains with friends when the accident happened.\nThe retired horticulturalist had been alone in the basket of the balloon, but was in phone contact with two friends on the ground. Three of his friends were travelling in a second balloon.\nThe group had taken off from St Jean d\u2019Aulps, part of the Portes du Soleil ski area near Morzine, it is thought. But at 5.15pm on Thursday locals called police after seeing the bright red and blue fabric of Mr Bickerdike\u2019s Cameron Viva-65 balloon on the mountain above a hamlet in Abondance.\nA helicopter flew over the area but there was no sign of the pilot near his deflated balloon. As it grew dark, teams of mountain rescue police continued the search on foot and found his body at about 10pm.\nA police spokesman said: \u2018He was alone in the balloon and he crashed. But it would seem that he was unharmed and able to walk. He called friends to tell them he was fine.\n\u2018But when he went to seek help he fell down the mountain and died. It appears he walked a little distance from the balloon and then fell. It is icy and dangerous and it was getting dark. We do not know why he crashed.\u2019\nAt the family home in Brampton, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, his widow Julie, 54, whose children are aged 20 to 37, paid tribute to her husband. She said: \u2018He was a very active person. He sailed across the Atlantic and was a balloon pilot.\nBreathtaking: A balloon in the mountains\n\u2018Ballooning was just one of his pastimes. He was a born-again Christian with a deep faith. That gives us comfort because we know where he has gone. His children will remember him as full of fun.\n\u2018He was on holiday with three close friends, doing a route he had travelled a couple of times before. They were all very experienced balloonists but it wasn\u2019t a problem with the balloon, it\u2019s just one of those silly incidents. He was always planning his next challenge. We knew he was never going to be someone who died in their bed.\u2019\nDon Cameron, founder of Cameron Balloons, said: \u2018This is very sad news. If only he had remained where he landed. From what I understand, the balloon was undamaged. The pilot landed in a remote spot and I understand he secured the balloon to a tree.\n\u2018He then decided to climb down the mountain himself. He was talking to his friends on the ground and at one stage he said he felt he was in a dangerous place.\u2019\n}}

Only S-300 and Buk surface-to-air missile systems are capable of hitting targets at such altitude, the source said.\nBuk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile systems developed by the former USSR and Russia to engage targets at an engagement altitude of 11,000-25,000 meters depending on the model.\nRIA Novosti \/ Evgeny Yepanchintsev RIA Novosti \/ Evgeny Yepanchintsev\nChances are high that the Malaysian plane was really downed by the Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense, Yury Karash, pilot and aviation expert, told RT.\n\u201cA Boeing-777 is an extremely reliable piece of machinery. Modern planes don\u2019t just crash with no reason,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us recall how a Ukrainian missile downed Russian TU-154 aircraft ten years ago. I can\u2019t completely exclude the possibility the Boeing-777 was also hit by a missile.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who could\u2019ve shot it down. But I can allege that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces: simply because its military \u2013 anti-aircraft defense, in particular \u2013 are, unfortunately, unqualified.

{{A U.S. Navy plane carrying passengers and cargo to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan crashed in the Philippine Sea this week, Pentagon officials stated. Rescuers recovered eight individuals from the crash and another three are missing. The rescued eight are described as in good condition and a search continues for the remaining three.\nThe aircraft, a C-2A Greyhound Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft, took off Wednesday from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, to rendezvous with the USS Reagan at sea. According to USNI News, the aircraft was assigned to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VRC) 30, Detachment Five out of Atsugi, Japan.\nThe C-2A was carrying sailors to the ship along with cargo when it went down. The C-2A Greyhound is one of the oldest aircraft in the U.S. Navy. Designed to ferry people and goods between an aircraft carrier and land, it is unarmed and features a large cargo ramp in the rear of the aircraft to fit oversized cargo such as aircraft engines. The Greyhound carries up to 10,000 pounds of cargo, 26 passengers, or some combination thereof.\nU.S. Navy personnel offload cargo from the rear of a C-2A Greyhound on the aircraft carrier USS Bush.

According to manufacturer Northrop Grumman, \u201cDuring a typical six-month peacetime aircraft carrier deployment, a two-aircraft C-2A detachment will accumulate approximately 1,000 flight hours, transport about 5,000 passengers and haul about one million pounds of cargo.\u201d Despite the high number of miles the C-2A has a relatively low accident rate, with the last fatal accident in 1973. The Navy lost two other aircraft in separate accidents in 2003 and 2005.\nThe Navy has already decided on a replacement for the aging C-2A, the V-22 Osprey.

{{Egypt\u2019s civil aviation ministry confirms it will launch criminal investigation into May crash of flight MS804 that killed 66\nEgyptian air accident investigators have revealed that traces of explosives were detected on the remains of victims of the EgyptAir flight from Paris that crashed in the Mediterranean sea in May.\nThe claim by Egypt\u2019s civil aviation investigation committee suggests that the crash, which killed all 66 people on board, was caused by a bomb, although it does not solve the mystery of where a device might have been smuggled on board - or who was responsible.\nThe disappearance of the EgyptAir flight came only months after a Russian airliner flying from Sharm el-Sheikh was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula \u2013 killing 224 people. That attack was claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State.\n\u201cThe central directorate of aircraft accident investigation received reports from the forensic medicine authority indicating traces of explosive materials found in some of the remains of the victims\u2019 bodies,\u201d the ministry stated on Thursday.\nThe months-long investigation into the disaster has been hampered by disagreements between French and Egyptian experts and a dispute over the return of the bodies of French passengers. The Airbus A320 had been carrying 40 Egyptians, 15 French people, two Iraqis, two Canadians and one passenger each from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.\nAn Egyptian source familiar with the matter said Cairo had informed France months ago of its findings but French investigators had requested more time to study them.\n\u201cThat is why it took so long to make an announcement,\u201d the source said, declining to be named as the investigation is continuing. Following the announcement on Thursday, Egypt said it would be launching a criminal investigation into the crash.\nFrance\u2019s air safety agency, BEA, and the plane manufacturer, Airbus, both declined to comment on the announcement, which comes while Cairo is still investigating the October 2015 crash of the Russian passenger plane in Sinai.\nIf a bomb is established as the cause of the May crash, investigators will have to determine whether a device could have been smuggled onboard a flight taking off from France\u2019s busiest airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle. The plane had also visited Tunisia and Eritrea in the days before it went down.\nComing just months after the Russian plane crashed, the EgyptAir disaster led to widespread flight cancellations and dealt a major blow to Egypt\u2019s vital tourism sector, already weakened by years of unrest unleashed by the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.\nIn recent months Egypt has spent millions of dollars trying to restore international confidence in its airport security measures. Russia suspended all flights to the country after the October crash, while Britain cancelled flights to Sharm El-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort from which the airliner took off.\nThe EgyptAir plane had been flying from Paris to Cairo when it disappeared from radar over the Mediterranean. Investigators determined that a fire had broken out in or near the cockpit before it crashed between Crete and the coast of northern Egypt.\nThe word \u201cfire\u201d was audible on the plane\u2019s cockpit voice recorder shortly before it crashed, the Egyptian investigative committee said in July.\nThe black box, retrieved from the crash site by a specialist diving vessel, also confirmed that smoke alarms had been triggered onboard, while recovered wreckage had indications of soot.\nThe Airbus A320 had broadcast a number of fault messages before contact was lost, indicating that smoke had entered the nose of the aircraft where sensitive avionics control systems are housed. Flight data, however, suggested that rather than exploding in mid-air, the plane had flown into the sea.\nEgyptian investigators have confirmed the aircraft made a 90-degree left turn followed by a 360-degree turn to the right before hitting the sea.\nSince the crash, small pieces of the wreckage and human remains have been recovered, while the bulk of the plane and the bodies of victims are believed to be in the water.\nIn September, French investigators were reported to have found trace levels of the explosive TNT on recovered debris but claimed they were prevented from further examining it. Egyptian officials denied the claim.\nWhile some speculation had originally focused on the crew being overcome in the cockpit as the cause of the disaster, the new evidence has put the emphasis back on a deliberate explosion.\nEgypt\u2019s aviation minister, Sherif Fathy, had said previously a terrorist attack was the most likely cause of the crash. The chances of an attack were \u201chigher than the possibility of a technical [failure]\u201d, Fathy said in May following the crash.\nHowever, two anonymous western sources briefed on the latest turn in the investigation expressed reservations to Reuters about the explosives findings and suggested a technical problem remained a likely cause. Aviation experts have said there is little chance that a mechanical fault was responsible.\nThe latest announcement came as it was disclosed that the families of five French victims had launched a petition to recover the remains of those lost on the flight, saying it had been seven months since they had been killed. The Egyptian authorities had promised to return the bodies weeks ago but the process had inexplicably halted, perhaps because of the discovery of the explosive residue.\nIsis has carried out several attacks in recent years, mainly in Sinai, where it is based, but also on the Egyptian mainland. The group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a Cairo church on Sunday, which killed at least 24 people \u2013 mainly women \u2013 and wounded nearly 50.\n}}

{{Eleven people died in the crash (Picture: YouTube)\nThe organisers of the Shoreham air show, at which a jet crashed and killed 11 people, failed to carry out a proper risk assessment and were unaware of the pilot\u2019s display plans, a report found.\nAt last year\u2019s show, the 1959 Hawker Hunter fell to the ground while its pilot, Andy Hill, executed a rolling manoeuvre.

{{BAGHDAD\/ARBIL (Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched an airborne assault on rebel-held Tikrit on Thursday with commandos flown into a stadium in helicopters, at least one of which crashed after taking fire from insurgents who have seized northern cities.\nWitnesses said battles were raging in the city, hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein, which fell to Sunni Islamist fighters two weeks ago on the third day of a lightning offensive that has given them control of most majority Sunni regions.\nThe helicopters were shot at as they flew low over the city and landed in a stadium at the city\u2019s university, a security source at the scene said. Government spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment and by evening the assault was still not being reported on state media.\nThe source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said fierce clashes ensued, centered around the university compound.\nAhmed al-Jubbour, professor at the university\u2019s college of agriculture, described fighting in the colleges of agriculture and sports education after three helicopters arrived.\n\u201cI saw one of the helicopters land opposite the university with my own eyes and I saw clashes between dozens of militants and government forces,\u201d he said.\nJubbour said one helicopter crash-landed in the stadium. Another left after dropping off troops and a third remained on the ground. Army snipers were positioning themselves on tall buildings in the university complex.\nIraq\u2019s million-strong army, trained and equipped by the United States, largely evaporated in the north after Sunni fighters led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant launched their assault with the capture of the north\u2019s biggest city Mosul on June 10.\nBut in recent days, government forces have been fighting back, relying on elite commandos flown in by helicopter to defend the country\u2019s biggest oil refinery at Baiji.\nA successful operation to recapture territory inside Tikrit would deliver the most serious blow yet against an insurgency which for most of the past two weeks has seemed all but unstoppable in the Sunni heartland north and west of Baghdad.\nMALIKI UNDER PRESSURE\nIn the capital, the president\u2019s office confirmed that a new parliament elected two months ago would meet on Tuesday, the deadline demanded by the constitution, to begin the process of forming a government.\nPrime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shi\u2019ite-led State of Law coalition won the most seats in the April election but needs allies to form a cabinet, is under strong pressure from the United States and other countries to swiftly build a more inclusive government to undermine support for the insurgency.\nMaliki confirmed this week that he would support the constitutional deadlines to set up a new government, after pressure from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who flew to Baghdad for emergency crisis talks to urge him to act.\nThe 64-year-old Shi\u2019ite Islamist is fighting for his political life in the face of an assault that threatens to dismember his country. Sunni, Kurdish and rival Shi\u2019ite groups have demanded he leave office, and some ruling party members have suggested he could be replaced with a less polarizing figure, although close allies say he has no plan to step aside.\nFighters from ISIL - an al Qaeda offshoot which says all Shi\u2019ites are heretics who should be killed - have been assisted in their advance by other, more moderate Sunni armed groups who share their view that Sunnis have been persecuted under Maliki.\nWashington hopes that armed Sunni tribal groups, which turned against al Qaeda during the U.S. \u201csurge\u201d offensive of 2006-2007, can again be persuaded to switch sides and back the government, provided that a new cabinet is more inclusive.\nKerry held talks with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday as part of a diplomatic push on Iraq. He was to travel to Saudi Arabia on Friday for talks with King Abdullah on Iraq and Syria.\nShi'ite volunteers, who have joined the Iraqi army to fight against the predominantly Sunni militants from the radical Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), take part in a parade on a street in Kanaan, Diyala province, June 26, 2014. REUTERS\/Stringer\nIn Riyadh, King Abdullah ordered measures to protect his nation against \u201cterrorist threats\u201d after heading a security meeting to discuss the fallout from Iraq, the state news agency said.\nThe United States, which withdrew its ground forces in 2011, has ruled out sending them back but is dispatching up to 300 military advisers, mostly special forces troops, to help organize Baghdad\u2019s military response.\nThe Pentagon said on Thursday that an additional 50 troops had arrived in Baghdad and the first of two Joint Operations Centers had been activated.\nThe fighters have been halted about an hour\u2019s drive north of Baghdad and on its western outskirts, but have pressed on with their advances in areas like religiously mixed Diyala province north of the capital, long one of Iraq\u2019s most violent areas.\nOn Thursday morning, ISIL fighters staged an assault on the town of Mansouriyat al-Jabal, home to inactive gas fields where foreign firms operate, in northeastern Diyala province. An Iraqi oil ministry official denied fighters had taken the field.\nA roadside bomb in Baghdad\u2019s Shi\u2019ite northern district of Kadhimiya killed eight people on Thursday, police and hospital sources said.\nSYRIA STRIKES\nThe ISIL-led advance has put the United States on the same side as its enemy of 35 years Iran, the Middle East\u2019s main Shi\u2019ite power, as well as Iran\u2019s ally President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who is fighting ISIL in his country.\nLocals in the Iraqi border town of al-Qaim, captured by ISIL several days ago, say Syrian jets carried out strikes against militants on the Iraqi side of the frontier this week, marking the first time Assad\u2019s air force has come to Baghdad\u2019s aid.\nPublicly, Baghdad, which operates helicopters but no jets, said its own forces carried out the air strike. But a senior Iraqi government official confirmed on condition of anonymity that the strike was mounted by the Syrian air force.\nSlideshow (7 Images)\nIran, which armed and trained some of Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite militias, has pledged to intervene in Iraq if necessary to protect Shi\u2019ite holy places. Thousands of Shi\u2019ites have answered Maliki\u2019s call to join the armed forces to defend the country.\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague arrived in Baghdad on Thursday, reinforcing the international push for Maliki to speed up the political process.\nUnder the official schedule, parliament will have 30 days from when it first meets on Tuesday to name a president and 15 days after that to name a prime minister.\nIn the past the process has dragged out, taking nine months to seat the government in 2010. Any delays would allow Maliki to continue to serve as caretaker.\n}}

{{Teams searching for AirAsia Flight 8501 have found more than 40 bodies along with debris floating in the Java Sea southwest of Borneo, and the airline has now confirmed in an official statement that the debris \u201cis indeed from QZ8501,\u201d the flight that lost contact with air-traffic control on the morning of the 28th.\nAt least three bodies had been recovered by Tuesday evening local time and a ship was being dispatched to ferry the remains to the nearest city. Searchers reported seeing a large shadow on the seabed, suggesting the crashed jet has been located.\nSunu Widyatmoko, chief executive officer of AirAsia Indonesia, said in a statement: \u201cWe are sorry to be here today under these tragic circumstances. We would like to extend our sincere sympathies to the family and friends of those on board QZ8501. Our sympathies also go out to the families of our dear colleagues.\u201d\nTony Fernandes, the group chief executive officer of AirAsia, added: \u201cI am absolutely devastated. This is a very difficult moment for all of us at AirAsia as we await further developments of the search and rescue operations but our first priority now is the well being of the family members of those onboard QZ8501.\u201d\nIndonesian military aircraft and some ships spotted several objects, including an airplane\u2019s emergency exit door, an emergency slide, and square metal objects, as well as the bodies, floating in the sea, beginning around 11 a.m. local time, Bambang Soelistyo, Indonesia\u2019s search-and-rescue chief, said at a press conference in Jakarta that was broadcast live. Other officials told reporters that searchers also spotted a life vest and baggage in the water. Within hours, the Indonesian navy said dozens of bodies were being seen.\nSoelistyo said all teams involved in the search operation\u2014aircraft and seaborne vessels\u2014would now converge on the area south of Pangkalan Bun and that the priority is to pick up metal objects and objects suspected to be bodies and identify them. The Airbus A320-200, carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members, vanished Saturday en route from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. Authorities said they dispatched at least one helicopter to pick up at least 10 pieces of debris to be checked and that all the items will be taken to the search and rescue coordination post on the island of Belitung. Some of the items Indonesian military aircraft saw were long yellow tubes. Other objects were white, red, and black. AirAsia\u2019s jets are red and white, and many of the seats are black.\nSoelistyo\u2019s comments, delivered in Indonesian, were echoed by Indonesia\u2019s civil aviation director-general, Djoko Murjatmodjo, who told AFP, \u201cFor the time being, it can be confirmed that it\u2019s the AirAsia plane and the transport minister will depart soon\u201d for the area.\nThe news hit like a thunderbolt in the crisis center in Surabaya where relatives have been gathering since air traffic control lost contact with the plane. It appeared Soelistyo\u2019s televised bombshell was the first time any family members definitively learned their loved ones had perished. The BBC reported that the survivors learning of the news triggered so much \u201cscreaming and crying\u201d that one woman collapsed and had to be carried from the large room. As with the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 nine months ago, relatives had been holding out hope that the plane somehow was intact somewhere; their family members safe. Soelistyo\u2019s stark news appeared to have dashed such hopes.\nSoelistyo\u2019s press conference came after Indonesian officials told reporters they were sending teams to investigate reports of \u201cbillowing\u201d smoke being seen in the area where the plane disappeared, just south of Belitung. The smoke was spotted by a Chinese team, though authorities cautioned that it might be unrelated to Flight 8501, wary that the reports could be among the red herrings that almost invariably develop in this type of case. Officials also had received reports of loud bangs\u2014called in by fishermen\u2014and an oil slick. Neither was found to be significant.\nThe news from Indonesia prompted AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes to take to Twitter to offer condolences to relatives of the presumably lost passengers and crew. \u201cMy heart is filled with sadness,\u201d tweeted the tycoon, who has long prided himself on his hugely popular airline\u2019s superior service and safety record.\nFlight 8501, carrying 137 adult passengers, 17 children, one infant, two pilots, and five crew members, disappeared after it apparently encountered storm clouds. The pilot asked air-traffic control for permission to climb from 32,000 to 38,000 feet to avoid the bad weather. Indonesian authorities said controllers approved the request, but received no reply and, shortly after that, the aircraft dropped off the radar. The disappearance sparked a massive international search effort that includes personnel and\/or equipment from countries ranging from the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia to Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia. The search has focused on waters around the islands of Bangka and Belitung in the Java Sea, across the water from the large province of Kalimantan.\nOn Monday, Soelistyo had jolted relatives as well as searchers by suggesting that the plane could be \u201cat the bottom of the sea.\u201d\nOceanographers say the Java Sea is relatively shallow, which should make it easier to spot wreckage in the water in the coming days. Strong currents and winds, however, mean any debris could be drifting up to 31 miles a day eastward, away from the impact zone.\n}}

Meanwhile, Egypt's chief prosecutor Nabil Sadek says he has ordered an \"urgent investigation\" into crash. Sadek instructed the National Security Prosecutor to open an \"extensive investigation\" in the incident. (AP Photo\/Thomas Ranner)\nEgyptAir Flight Made \u2018Three Emergency Landings\u2019 in 24 Hours Before It Crashed, Report Says\nEgyptAir flight MS-804 had to make three emergency landings in a 24-hour period before its crash, reports in French media said.\nThe Airbus A320 was forced to turn around after taking off and return to its originating airport: Asmara in Eritrea, Cairo, and Tunis. The plane was forced to land after warning systems signaled anomalies on board the plane, The Telegraph reported, citing France 3 TV.\nThe plane was quickly allowed to leave after inspectors carried out a technical audit and they didn\u2019t find anything wrong.\nThe plane disappeared off radar systems and crashed in the early hours on May 19 while it was flying from Paris to Cairo.\nThe claims of three emergency landings was disputed by EgyptAir\u2019s chairman, Safwat Mesallam, on Thursday. He said the French reports were \u201cuntrue,\u201d the Egypt Independent reported. He made the comments on the sidelines of a meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Dublin, Ireland.\n\u201cWe fully trust the aircraft and the pilot,\u201d added Musallam in the Telegraph report.\nThe flight went missing with 66 people on board in the early morning hours of April 26.\nMeanwhile, Alain Vidalies, France\u2019s transport minister, said he couldn\u2019t confirm the France 3 report. \u201cWe have a sudden event which could point towards an attack. On the other hand we have other information which points more towards an accident,\u201d Vidalies told France Info radio.\nThe grim report came as search crews narrowed in on the search radius for the plane\u2019s wreckage from 3 miles to 1.2 miles. French investigators announced Wednesday that they found a signal from one of the plane\u2019s black boxes, which contain the crucial flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorders.\nThe Greek defense minister has previously said that the plane swerved and dropped to 15,000 feet before it dropped off radar screens.\n}}

{{PARIS (Reuters) - The 2016 crash of a Paris-Cairo EgyptAir flight that killed all 66 people on board was likely caused by a cockpit fire, French investigators said, contradicting an earlier suggestion by Egyptian authorities that a bomb may have been the cause.\nPeople light candles during a candlelight vigil for the victims of EgyptAir flight 804, at the Cairo Opera house in Cairo, Egypt May 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\nIn rare criticism of another country\u2019s crash probe, the French BEA air accident investigation agency said in a statement that authorities in Egypt had apparently not followed up calls for further investigations.\nEgyptian officials have said traces of explosives were found on human remains retrieved from the crash, suggesting it was a malicious act.\n\u201cThe BEA\u2019s proposals concerning further work on the debris and recorded data were not, as far as the BEA knows, followed up. The technical elements of the investigation already collected by Egypt, including those provided by the BEA, are protected by the Egyptian judicial investigation,\u201d the French statement said.\nTwelve of those killed in the May 2016 crash were French nationals.\nIt is unusual for investigators to comment publicly on a case being led by their counterparts in another country. Any disagreement would usually be expressed confidentially, with public comments indicating serious divergences.\n\u201cThe BEA considers that the most likely hypothesis is that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aeroplane was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aeroplane,\u201d the statement said.\nIt noted that Egyptian investigators had not published their final report, adding that the BEA was ready to resume work with Egyptian authorities if they were to resume work on the probe.

{{A vintage plane crashed at altitude in the Swiss Alps on Saturday, in eastern Switzerland. All 20 passengers lost their lives in Switzerland's worst air tragedy since 2001.\nAt a sombre press conference in the town of Flims on Sunday, a day after the accident, Graub\u00fcnden cantonal police announced that all passengers on board \u2013 17 passengers, two pilots, and a flight attendant \u2013 lost their lives in the crash.\nIt's the worst accident in Swiss aviation since the crash of a Crossair plane at Bassersdorf, canton Zurich, killed 24 in 2001.\nAll of the passengers and crew members were Swiss, except for a couple from Austria who were also on board with their son.\nThe plane went down on the western side of the Piz Segnas mountain on Saturday afternoon (see map), at an altitude of 2,540 metres (8,330 feet). It was travelling between Locarno and D\u00fcbendorf when it crashed for unknown reasons.\nA large-scale salvage operation, which included the deployment of five helicopters, continued on Sunday morning and the airspace around the accident site remains closed; some of the walking trails in the area popular with hikers were also closed off.\npiz segnas piz segnas, canton graub\u00fcnden\nUnknown causes\nThe cause of the crash is as yet unknown, and officials said they're not aware of any distress call beforehand.\nDaniel Knecht of the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board said the plane appears to have hit the ground near-vertically and at high speed.\nSpeaking at the news conference Sunday in Flims, near the crash site, Knecht also said the vintage plane presumably didn't have the crash-resistant cockpit voice and data recorders that more modern aircraft have, which could complicate further investigations.\nHe said officials have essentially ruled out a collision with another aircraft or hitting an obstacle such as a wire. He also said there was no indication of foul play or that the aircraft lost parts or broke up before the crash.\nAs for the weather, he did not comment on whether or not the high temperatures, which can affect engine performance, may have played a role, but said that all avenues of investigation would be pursued.\nThe age of a plane also has no connection with its safety, he said, as long as the aircraft is well maintained.\nA Ju-52 in flight. The propeller planes were in production between 1932 and 1952. (Keystone)\n'Auntie Ju'\nThe crashed plane was a Junker Ju-52 (affectionately known as 'Tante Ju' or 'Auntie Ju' in German), owned and operated by the JU-Air company based in D\u00fcbendorf, which specialises in sightseeing flights using old military planes. The craft was constructed in 1939, and before Saturday had flown for 10,187 hours.\nJU-Air has been operating sightseeing tours with three Ju-52s since 1983, explained CEO Kurt Waldmeier, who said that Saturday was the worst day in the 36-year history of the company.\nThe two pilots (62 and 63 years old) had previously worked with the Swissair, Swiss, and Edelweiss airlines, and had served as military pilots with the Swiss Air Force for over 30 years. Both captains had several hundred hours flight experience on the Ju-52.\nThe 66-year-old flight attendant also had 40 years of professional experience, according to Waldmeier, who confirmed that the latest check-up of the plane was done in July, when no defects were found.\nAll flights operated by the company have been suspended until further notice.\nFamily tragedy\nIn a separate incident, cantonal police in Nidwalden also said that another aircraft went down near the town of Hergiswil earlier on Saturday morning, shortly before 10 am.\nUpon impact, the plane burst into flames, causing the surrounding forested area to catch fire; authorities had to send out a helicopter to extinguish the blaze before rescue workers could arrive at the scene.\nIn the evening, police confirmed that a family of four lost their lives in the accident. The charred state of the wreckage meant that victim identification was difficult, a police spokesman had earlier said.\nThe family \u2013 two parents and two young children \u2013 were from the region and had set off in the direction of France at 9:30 am.\nThe crashes come just a week after a light aircraft accident in canton Valais that claimed the lives of four people.\nLegendary Aircraft\nThis trimotor plane was built from 1931 to 1952.

{{* Chinese regulator will notify airlines to resume flying\n* U.S. has no plans to ground 737 MAX jets - official\n* Boeing shares lose 9 pct in pre-market trade\n* Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways also ground jets\n* Cause of Ethiopian Airlines crash not known (Adds Boeing, analyst comment, shares; paragraphs 2-7, 12-14)\nBy Stella Qiu and Josh Horwitz\nBEIJING\/SHANGHAI, March 11 (Reuters) - China\u2019s aviation regulator on Monday grounded nearly 100 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines, more than a quarter of the global fleet of the jets, after a deadly crash of one of the planes in Ethiopia.\nHowever, a U.S. official said it was unclear what information the Chinese regulator was acting on because the investigation of Sunday\u2019s crash, the second involving the latest version of the narrowbody jet, was in the early stages.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity as the topic is sensitive, the U.S. official said there were no plans to follow suit, as the jet had a stellar safety record in the United States and there was a lack of information on what caused the Ethiopian crash.\nBoeing, whose shares dropped 9 percent in U.S. pre-market trade, said the investigation remained in its early stages and it had no basis to issue new guidance to operators.\nIt was unusual to ground a plane type unless a specific mechanical issue or component failure had been identified and could be inspected, said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.\n\u201cIn this case it is not clear what the action item is, having done the suspension,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is lacking now is what happened in this case.\n\u201cThat means finding the black boxes and piecing together other circumstantial evidence from air traffic control recordings and so on.\u201d\nMost other Boeing 737 MAX operators globally told Reuters their planes would keep flying and they had no plans to cancel orders.\nSunday\u2019s crash, minutes after take-off, of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 bound for Nairobi, killed all 157 on board and prompted the carrier to ground the rest of its 737 MAX jets.\nIn October, a 737 MAX 8 operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air crashed 13 minutes after take-off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on a domestic flight, killing all 189 on board. The 737 MAX 8 first entered service in 2017.\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure flight safety.\n\u201cGiven that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,\u201d the CAAC said, adding the step was in line with its principle of zero tolerance of safety hazards. The 737 MAX 8 is sometimes referred to as the 737-8.\nThe grounding was due to safety concerns and not related to trade friction between the United States and China, Li Jian, the deputy head of the Chinese regulator, told reporters, the Yangcheng Evening News said.\n\u201cThese are two separate issues,\u201d the newspaper, which is backed by the government of the southern province of Guangdong, quoted Li as saying on the sidelines of a parliament meeting in Beijing.\nCHINA\u2019S FLEET\nChinese airlines have 96 737 MAX 8 jets in service, the state company regulator said on Twitter-like Weibo, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines.\nChinese aviation data firm Variflight said at least 29 international and domestic flights on Monday had been cancelled and that airlines had swapped out the plane on 256 other flights that had been scheduled to use it.\nChina Eastern\u2019s chairman, Liu Shaoyong, told financial publication Caixin on the sidelines of the Bejing meeting that it would only consider resuming 737 MAX 8 flights once Boeing issued a safety commitment for the jets and proved there was no aircraft design link between the two crashes.\nThe cause of the Indonesian crash is still being investigated.\nA November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but gave no reason for the crash.\nEthiopian Airlines said it had grounded its 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice as an \u201cextra safety precaution\u201d even though it did not know the cause of Sunday\u2019s crash.\nThe airline has a remaining fleet of four of the aircraft, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 says.\nCayman Airways said it had grounded both of its new 737 MAX 8 jets until it got more information.\nBut no other airlines with 737 MAX 8s in their fleets or on order, or their regulators, told Reuters they were grounding the aircraft or cancelling orders.\nBy January-end, Boeing had delivered 350 of the 737 MAX family jets to customers, with 4,661 more on order.\nWestern industry sources say China has been at pains in recent years to assert its independence as a safety regulator as it negotiates mutual safety standard recognition with regulators in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2017, it signed a mutual recognition deal with the FAA, but industry sources say it has struggled to gain approval from the FAA that would allow it to sell its self-developed C919 airliner to Western airlines.\nThe grounding was \u201creasonable and justified\u201d, said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin but added that he did not anticipate a major problem, as Chinese airlines operated fewer than 100 of the aircraft, among a combined fleet of more than 2,000 planes.

{{HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The second deadly crash of a prized new airplane in five months has renewed safety concerns about the 737 Max that could shape Boeing\u2019s fortunes for many years \u2014 and ended 346 lives prematurely.\nRescuers search through wreckage at the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed shortly after takeoff at Hejere near Bishoftu, or Debre Zeit, south of Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, on Sunday. (AP photo\/Yidnek Kirubel)\nThe 737 Max is the newest version of the 737, the best-selling airliner ever. Since its debut in 2017, Boeing has delivered more than 350 of them in several versions that vary by size.\nDozens of airlines around the world have embraced the plane for its fuel efficiency and utility for short and medium-haul flights.\nBoeing has taken more than 5,000 orders for the various Max versions, and they constitute the largest share of the company\u2019s backlog of nearly 5,900 planes. They carry list prices from $100 million to $135 million, although airlines routinely get deep discounts.\nThe plane suffered its first fatal accident in October, when a 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea, killing 189 people. That crash, however, had little apparent effect on new orders.\nHowever, the second deadly crash for a Max 8 on Sunday in Ethiopia, which killed all 157 people on board, could prove far more damaging if investigators find fault in Boeing\u2019s design or airlines and their passengers lose confidence in the jet.\nAlready airlines in Ethiopia, Mexico, China, Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia have temporarily grounded their Max 8s, in addition to Caribbean carrier Cayman Airways, Comair in South Africa, and Royal Air Maroc in Morocco.\nCrucially, however, there was no outward sign that the influential U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, would do the same.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said her department, which includes the FAA, was \u201cvery concerned\u201d and monitoring developments around Sunday\u2019s crash. She said she met with acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell to discuss the situation \u201cand what are our possible paths forward.\u201d She did not say whether the agency was considering grounding any planes.\nIt\u2019s unusual for authorities to take the step of grounding planes, and it\u2019s up to each country to set standards on which planes can fly and how those planes are maintained, said Todd Curtis, an aviation safety analyst who directs the Airsafe.com Foundation.\nIn the last major FAA recall, the agency grounded Boeing 787 passenger jets in 2013 after several instances in which lithium-ion batteries overheated. The plane was relatively new at the time. United was the only U.S. carrier affected, with six planes grounded.\nLate Monday, the FAA issued a statement saying that while others have drawn similarities between the Indonesia and Ethiopia crashes, the agency had not.\n\u201cThis investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions,\u201d the FAA said.\nThe FAA also said that no later than April it expects Boeing will complete changes, including new training for pilots in automated anti-stall technology that is suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash. Data released by Indonesian investigators indicates that pilots struggled unsuccessfully to counter the system, which repeatedly pointed the plane\u2019s nose down and may have sent it into a death spiral.\nA consumer group, FlyersRights.org, urged the FAA to ground the Max 8.\n\u201cThe FAA\u2019s wait-and-see attitude risks lives,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Paul Hudson.\nU.S. airlines repeated their belief that the plane is safe.\nAmerican Airlines, which operates 24 Max 8s, said it bases its judgment on collecting extensive data on its entire fleet, including the Max 8.\n\u201cWe have full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members,\u201d the carrier\u2019s vice president of flight service, Jill Surdeck, said in a memo to employees.\nSouthwest Airlines operates the largest U.S. fleet of Max planes, with 34 Max 8s. Spokesman Brian Parrish said the airline remains confident in their safety. United has about a dozen Max 9s, which are slightly bigger than the Max 8.\nDozens of Max aircraft crisscrossed the skies over the United States on Monday, and passengers continued to board them and fly without incident. Passengers interviewed at Houston\u2019s Hobby Airport were keenly aware of the crash in Ethiopia. They expressed concern but no panic.\n\u201cI drive in Houston every day,\u201d said Brian Browder, who was waiting for a flight to Washington, D.C. \u201cThat\u2019s the place to be worried.\u201d\nStill, Browder, who works for a construction-industry trade group and flies several times a month, said he would be \u201ca bit apprehensive\u201d about getting on a 737 MAX.\n\u201cThey need to explain exactly what happened and why,\u201d he said.\nKelly Wells, a health care worker from Austin, believes a catastrophic accident is less likely to happen in the United States.\n\u201cThose pilots are very well trained to handle an emergency. I\u2019m in capable hands,\u201d she said before a flight on Southwest, which operates the Max, although her flight was not among them.\nPeggy Chang Barber, a lawyer for a Houston nonprofit who was on her way to New York, said U.S. airlines are \u201cpretty vigilant\u201d about maintenance and pilot training, and she won\u2019t be concerned \u201cunless they find a fault with the plane.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t clear yet whether the plane\u2019s technology played a role in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, or whether that accident is related to the deadly Lion Air accident on Oct. 29 in Indonesia.\nEven if Boeing must make software or hardware changes to the plane, \u201cit\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t get past, but it would be an expensive process,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with Teal Group.\n\u201cHistorically, (airlines) cancel orders because of (fuel) performance shortfalls or because somebody else gave them a discount \u2014 not because of safety,\u201d Aboulafia said.\nThe FAA stripped the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 of its airworthiness certificate after numerous safety problems, including a 1979 crash in Chicago, yet it still outsold a rival plane made by Lockheed, he said.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n}}

{{A worker stands near a Boeing 737 MAX 8 at Boeing Co.\u2019s Renton Assembly Plant in Renton, Washington. Image Credit: AP\nDubai: Aviation experts on Tuesday called for a calmer examination of facts around Boeing\u2019s 737 MAXs, even as international regulators rushed to suspend commercial operations of the aircraft after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.\nBoeing\u2019s twin disasters involving its newest single-aisle jet add to the history of rare aviation accidents that call into question the safety of the planes themselves.\nBack-to-back incidents in which the aircraft is probed as a possible culprit are far less common than the usual litany of pilot error, mechanical failure, weather, war and terrorism. While investigators are still piecing together the crash in Ethiopia, the initial similarities with the Indonesia disaster in October - rapid pitching and dropping of the nose after takeoff - stirred immediate speculation into a connection involving the plane\u2019s design. The MAX is the latest variant of the 737, a short-haul workhorse that is the world\u2019s most widely flown jetliner.\nBut several analysts told Gulf News that there was simply not enough data yet around the cause of the crash on Sunday to question the aircraft.\nStill, aviation regulators from more than a dozen countries - ranging from China and the UK to Singapore, Australia, Germany and Norway - ordered their domestic airlines to temporarily halt the use of Boeing 737 MAXs and closed their airspace to the aircraft variant. Oman followed suit, with the aviation regulator saying it had \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d operations of 737 MAX at its airports. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) took a different approach, declining to order the suspension of Boeing 737 MAX 8s, suggesting that the aircraft remains safe to use.\nOngoing investigations\nLocal carrier flydubai cited the FAA notification yesterday on the \u201ccontinued airworthiness\u201d of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft. A spokesperson for flydubai said that \u201cno further action is required at this time\u201d but they were \u201ccontinuing to follow closely the ongoing investigations\u201d.\nSome analysts warned that there was very little information so far to call for the grounding of the Boeing model. John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting in London, said it was \u201cunusual\u201d to see some of the groundings around the world. \u201cThere has to be an abundance in caution, but you equally do not take massive steps, such as grounding aircraft, unless you have a clear and factual reason to do so,\u201d he told Gulf News. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s pressure but the challenge is trying to differentiate between the apparent similarities of two accidents and not jumping to quick conclusions\u2026 The things that on the face may look similar may have no bearings on reality,\u201d added Strickland.\nBoeing to upgrade software\nAmid the global turmoil, Boeing said it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, a few hours after the FAA said it would mandate \u201cdesign changes\u201d in the aircraft by April. The company said in the aftermath of Lion Air crash it has for several months \u201cbeen developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.\u201d The upgrade \u201cwill be deployed across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks,\u201d it said.\nBoeing and its partners are no stranger to new models plagued by teething difficulties. McDonnell Douglas, a planemaker later acquired by Boeing, had its entire DC-10 fleet grounded in 1979 by the FAA after an American Airlines jet lost an engine on takeoff. Regulators allowed the plane to be flown and a decade later, 111 people died on a United Airlines DC-10 crash. US and European regulators moved promptly to ground Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 to investigate a series of battery fires. Boeing got the plane flying again in less than four months following a redesign of crucial battery components.\n}}

{{The family of a 4-year-old girl who died when the homebuilt airplane she was riding in crash-landed in a parking lot along the Oregon coast has filed a $35 million lawsuit against the company that sold the kit used to make the plane.\nThe suit seeks damages from Van's Aircraft of Aurora for the death of Zoey Wahl, as well as for injuries to the girl's mother, April Gleason. Gleason suffered a broken back, sternum and rib cage in the May 31, 2014, crash. Despite those injuries, she gave CPR to her daughter until emergency responders arrived.\nThe suit was filed last week in Marion County Circuit Court. A representative from Van's Aircraft declined comment Friday, citing the pending litigation.\nThe suit contends that homebuilt airplanes pose a danger to the general public because they don't have to pass vigorous safety standards and that kit manufacturers -- including Van's Aircraft -- recklessly sell the kits to drive up profits.\nThe girl was flying with her mother and step-grandfather from Newport to her home in Seattle when they crashed into the grounds of the Georgia-Pacific paper mill just a few miles from takeoff.\nThe girl and her step-grandfather -- Douglas Nebert, 51, of Newport -- were pronounced dead at the scene. Nebert had been piloting the plane.\nA blockage cut off fuel to the engine, the suit says.\nNebert built the RV-10, a four-seat, single-engine propeller plane, from a kit made by Van's Aircraft, according to the suit. It sells for about $45,000.\nThe suit claims that Van's Aircraft exploited a Federal Aviation Administration loophole for \"experimental\" planes -- also known as \"homebuilt\" or \"amateur-built\" planes. The FAA doesn't require the same rigorous testing for homebuilt planes as it does for professionally built planes, the suit states.\n\"Van's recklessly sells its aircraft kits to ordinary consumers by ensuring them that even though those consumers are deemed the 'builder' of the aircraft, they do not need any experience or special knowledge to safely assemble the aircraft, but can safely assemble the aircraft by following Van's detailed assembly plans and utilizing Van's support,\" the suit states.\nVan's Aircraft is one of the largest kit manufacturers in the U.S. The company is located at the Aurora State Airport, a 30-minute drive south of Portland.\nTen percent of U.S. aircraft -- about 33,000 -- are homebuilt, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. They account for 21 percent of fatal accidents, the board said.\nMatthew Clarke, the Portland attorney representing Gleason and the girl's estate, told The Oregonian\/OregonLive on Monday that the more lenient safety standards allow Van's Aircraft to sell its kits at a cheaper price than professionally built aircraft. That has allowed the company to gain a leg up on competitors that don't sell kits.\nClarke said the loosened FAA standards for homebuilt planes were meant to foster \"the spirit of invention\" and innovation among individual Americans who know what they're doing.\nIn addition to Van's Aircraft, the suit lists the FloScan Instrument Co. of Seattle as a defendant. The suit claims that FloScan sold a defective fuel flow transducer that Nebert installed shortly before the fatal flight.\nA representative from FloScan didn't return a call for comment Monday.\nRead the lawsuit.\n-- Aimee Green\n503-294-5119\n}}

{{The FBI has located human remains in the wreckage of the Horizon Air plane that crashed Friday after it was stolen and flown by an airport worker.\n\"While the focus of our investigation thus far has centered on Richard Russell, 29, of Sumner, Washington, the FBI is awaiting the results of a review by the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office,\" FBI Seattle said in a statement.\nAuthorities said Russell took off in the stolen plane at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Friday night, flew for about an hour with military jets chasing him and crashed the 76-seater on a heavily wooded island.\nThe flight data recorder and components of the cockpit voice recorder have been recovered and are with the National Transportation Safety Board, according to the FBI.\nRussell was the only person aboard, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said. The Sheriff's Department described Russell as suicidal but did not elaborate.\nThe Horizon Air plane is unrecognizable, said a NTSB official. The plane went through several 100-foot-high lines of trees and was fragmented from the crash into pieces tiny enough to pick up, NTSB Western Pacific Region chief Debra Eckrote said Sunday.\n\"You couldn't even tell it was a plane except for some of the bigger sections, like the wing section,\" Eckrote said. \"Even the small sections, most of it doesn't resemble a plane.\"\nThe flight data recorder is burned but intact, Eckrote said, and will be shipped tomorrow. It is expected to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, she said. Analysis will begin midweek. It is unknown when the full analysis will be completed.\n'A complete shock' to the family\nThe plane crash has left Russell's family devastated.\nIn a statement, his family said his \"intent was not to harm anyone,\" referring to audio recordings of Russell talking to air traffic control during the flight.\n\"This is a complete shock to us,\" the family said Saturday night. \"We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now.\"\nRussell had worked as a Horizon Air ground service agent for 3\u00bd years. His job included directing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, handling baggage and tidying and de-icing planes.\nRussell, or \"Beebo\" as some called him, was \"a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend,\" his family said. They also said the 29-year-old was \"kind and gentle to each person he met.\"\nOfficials don't believe Russell had a pilot's license, and they don't know how he knew to fly the plane. Jeremy Kaelin said he worked with Russell in 2016, and remembered \"happy, funny\" chats with him in the break room.\n\"He was a nice guy,\" Kaelin said. \"He was definitely one of the harder working people on the ramps.\"\nMilitary jets did not bring the plane down\nRussell had worked a shift Friday when he took a plane parked in a maintenance area of the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, said Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group, which owns Horizon Air.\nHe used a vehicle known as a pushback tractor to move the empty turboprop plane and took off without authorization at 7:32 p.m. Friday, officials said.\nRussell flew for about an hour, talking periodically with air traffic controllers and making turns and even some aerobatic maneuvers as two armed F-15 jets followed him, officials said.\nVideo from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point pulling up for a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down and then pulling back up just feet above a body of water.\nThe plane eventually crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island, starting a fire in the woods and killing Russell. No one outside the plane was injured, officials said.\nThe cause of the crash wasn't immediately known but authorities said the F-15s did not bring the plane down.\nSecurity concerns\nThe FBI said it does not consider the incident terror-related but the theft of a commercial aircraft from a major US airport has exposed a gap in airline security.\nAuthorities will try to piece together how a security scare of this magnitude occurred at a major airport.\nExperts said the crash exposed alarming holes in airport security, and is likely to prompt a major review of industry security measures.\n\"This is going to be a major learning event for the industry,\" CNN aviation analyst Justin Green said. \"This is a really big deal.\"\nRussell managed to steal the Horizon Air turboprop from a maintenance area by himself. He was in uniform, had proper credentials and had clearance to be in secure aircraft areas, said Tilden, the airline CEO.\n\"They're credential employees. They're there to work on the airplanes. ... This is aviation in America. The doors of the airplanes are not keyed like a car. There is not an ignition key like a car. The setup in aviation in America is we secure the airfield,\" Tilden said.\nRussell appeared to have broken protocol several times. He shouldn't have been able to board the plane alone and go unnoticed. He also moved the plane by himself while protocol calls for two people to tow an aircraft.\n\"The fact he was out there by himself, towing the aircraft by himself ... then moving the tracker out of the way, so he could get on the aircraft and move. The fact that all of that happened without even being noticed by anyone on the ground service crew, that is just phenomenal to me,\" said CNN analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie.\n}}

{{(CNN) \u2014 An airline employee\u2019s unauthorized takeoff from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport before dying in a crash will likely prompt a major review of already tightly controlled industry security measures, experts said Saturday.\n\u201cThis is going to be a major learning event for the industry,\u201d CNN aviation analyst Justin Green said. \u201cThis is a really big deal.\u201d\nThe biggest question: How did a ground service agent \u2014 whose job includes directing planes for takeoff and gate approaches as well as baggage handling and de-icing \u2014 manage to steal a 76-seat Horizon Air turboprop and fly it for nearly an hour Friday night with military jets in pursuit before plunging into a wooded island?\n\u201cIf this pilot, instead of doing what he ended up doing, had wanted to crash the airplane into downtown Seattle, the fighter (jets) were not going to be able to stop him; air traffic control was not going to stop him,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis has to be a major, major issue.\u201d\nThe FBI\u2019s Seattle office said the plane\u2019s theft and crash weren\u2019t considered terrorism.\nStill, the episode appears to expose alarming gaps in airport security in the post-9\/11 era, according to experts.\nNo one else was believed to be on the plane, authorities said. The 29-year-old airline employee died in the crash.\n\u201cThere is a protocol to not allow anyone singularly to get onboard an aircraft,\u201d CNN safety analyst David Soucie said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to access the aircraft \u2026 you make sure that you check with someone else, and that someone else (will confirm) that \u2026 you have the right authority to get onto that aircraft.\n\u201cEvery airport in the country is going to be looking\u201d at whether current protocols need to be changed, Soucie said.\nThe plane took off without authorization around 8 p.m. PT, with the employee \u2014 who was not a pilot \u2014 at the controls, according to airport officials.\nVideo from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point doing a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down, then pulling up just feet above a body of water.\nIn audio recordings posted on Broadcastify, the man can be heard talking to air traffic controllers as they try to guide him to land the plane.\nAt one point, he apologizes and says he is a \u201cbroken guy\u201d with \u201ca few screws loose.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of people that care about me, and it\u2019s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now.\u201d\nWithin minutes of the plane\u2019s takeoff, the military scrambled two armed F-15 jets from Oregon to follow it, according to local and airline authorities and two sources with knowledge of the situation. They pursued the aircraft before it went down on Ketron Island, between Tacoma and Olympia.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear what training, if any, the man had as a pilot.\nA ground service agent\u2019s responsibilities don\u2019t involve touching planes\u2019 controls, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. But the plane made turns and aerobatic maneuvers that suggested some skill.\n\u201cIn this plane, he certainly knew how to retract the landing gear; he coordinated both engines, powered them up to get a coordinated takeoff,\u201d she said. \u201cA couple of the turns, it looked like what we call in basic flight training a \u2018coordinated turn,\u2019 meaning that he not only used the yoke \u2026 but you also coordinate with the rudders and you do the turns.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cYeah, he knew how to fly. But \u2026 the air traffic controller had to tell him how to set what they call the \u2018bugs\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re just little sort of little levers, or little notches on your indicator for your heading \u2026 which is kind of basic.\n\u201cSo, (he) had some knowledge but clearly wasn\u2019t a commercial pilot.\u201d\nThe plane was taken from a maintenance position and was not scheduled for a passenger flight, said Gary Beck, Horizon Air\u2019s president and chief executive officer.\n}}

{{(Reuters) - A Takata air bag inflator ruptured in a fatal car crash earlier this week in Malaysia, Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said on Friday, in what appears to be the 23rd death worldwide linked to the faulty part that can emit deadly metal fragments.\nFILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured on the Honda stand during the 88th Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, March 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\nThe Japanese automaker has previously confirmed 18 deaths since 2009 linked to the issue that sparked the largest auto industry safety recall in history, involving about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers.\nIn addition to the Honda deaths, Ford Motor Co (F.N) has reported two Takata-linked deaths in the United States since 2015. Honda also has reported three other fatal crashes in vehicles equipped with Takata air bag inflators that ruptured, including the new one in Malaysia. No official cause of death has been given by local authorities in the three crashes.\nThe latest incident took place on Wednesday in a 2004 Honda City vehicle in Malaysia\u2019s capital Kuala Lumpur, Honda said.\nOf the confirmed Honda deaths, 13 have been in the United States and five in Malaysia. The other three ruptures in fatal crashes outside the United States took place in Australia and Malaysia.\nHonda said the ill-fated 2004 City vehicle in Malaysia had been recalled in 2015, but repairs were never made.\nIn total, nearly 30 million U.S. vehicles remain unrepaired in the recall. More than 290 injuries worldwide are also linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.\nHonda, Ford and Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) have urgently warned owners of some older U.S. vehicles to stop driving them until they get repairs made. Ford and Mazda\u2019s warning covers some 2006 Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickups, while Honda\u2019s warning covers some 2001-2003 cars.\nIn April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company is now known as Joyson Safety Systems and is a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. (600699.SS)\nLast month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it would hold meetings with 12 major automakers that failed to fulfill a December 2017 target deadline for completing repairs on the highest-priority vehicles with dangerous Takata air bag inflators.\nNHTSA said the 12 automakers have collectively repaired 65 percent of 20 million vehicles in the highest priority groups, leaving about 7 million unrepaired.\nNHTSA has been criticized by some Democratic lawmakers for not doing more to prod automakers to fix vehicles faster. A U.S. Senate hearing in March also looked at the issue.\nTakata pleaded guilty in 2017 single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement.\n}}

{{Five Italian tourists and a child among dead after light plane and helicopter plunge into Hudson\nNine people were killed today after a sightseeing helicopter carrying Italian tourists collided in mid-air with a small plane near New York and crashed into the Hudson river.\nEyewitnesses saw a wing come off the plane during the collision just after noon US time and watched as the helicopter \"fell like a stone\" into the river.\nFive Italian tourists and the pilot were aboard the helicopter; in the plane, along with the pilot, there were two passengers, one of whom was a child. Another pilot on the ground at the heliport saw the plane approaching and tried to radio an alert to the helicopter above. But the warning was either not heard, or failed to get through in time.\nThe collision took place just south of the stretch of river where a US Airways jet that had run into trouble after apparently hitting a flock of geese was ditched in January by its pilot, who was hailed as a hero for saving the lives of all 150 people on board.\nTwo bodies were recovered but there was no hope of finding survivors, said New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who described the incident as \"not survivable\".\nHe said that police had found one piece of wreckage in the murky waters of the Hudson and that the search would probably continue for a few days.\n\"This has changed from a rescue to a recovery mission. There's not going to be a happy ending,\" he added.\nThe plane, which was a single-engine Piper PA-32R-300, had taken off earlier from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and was flying south along the river when it appeared to lose control as it banked steeply and struck the helicopter close to the shore line of Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThe helicopter, operated by Liberty Helicopter, the largest sightseeing and charter helicopter operator in the north-east US, had taken off moments earlier from West 30th Street in Manhattan.\nHundreds of people on both sides of the mile-wide river watched as the two aircraft appeared to break apart, with the rotary blades detaching from the helicopter, opposite the west side of Manhattan.\nOn the waterfront at Hoboken, people scattered as pieces of the debris fell from the sky while a wheel from one of the aircraft lay on Hoboken's Sinatra Drive.\n\"I saw the plane coming down and the helicopter coming across,\" said Hilda Igartua, 53, of Union City, New Jersey, who added that the plane's trajectory did not change after the collision but the helicopter came apart and spun down in pieces.\n\"We saw the helicopter propellers fly all over,\" said Katie Tanski, of Hoboken.\nMelissa Green, 33, and her husband were in a park along the river on the New York side and heard the crash. \"We turned around and saw these two mushroom splashes,\" Green said.\n\"What was really weird is there was no wreckage, nothing. I hope they find the people, but I don't know. They just disappeared,\" she explained.\n\"First I saw a piece of something flying through the air. Then I saw the helicopter going down into the water,\" she said, adding that the crowd in the park seemed too stunned to react. \"I thought it was my imagination.\"\nThe weather at the time of the collision was clear and mild. Vessels including water taxis diverted to the scene of the accident along with fire boats and Coast Guard rescue teams but both of the aircraft sank quickly under a strong current.\nPolice divers were carrying out a search of the river as an investigation was launched by the Federal Aviation Administration.\nThe accident happened in a busy general aviation corridor over the river that is often filled with sightseeing craft on sunny days.\nPilots have some freedom to pick their own route, as long as they stay under 300m and do not stray too close to Manhattan's skyscrapers.\nAccidents are not frequent, but happen every few years. Cory Lidle, a pitcher for the New York Yankees baseball team, and his flight instructor died in 2006 when their plane hit a skyscraper while flying along a popular sightseeing route.\nTwo years ago, a Liberty helicopter fell 150m to the ground during another sightseeing trip. The pilot was credited with safely landing the aircraft in the Hudson and helping evacuate the seven passengers.\nIn 1997, a rotor on one of its sightseeing helicopters clipped a Manhattan building, forcing an emergency landing.

{{This article is over 4 months old\nLion Air says plane underwent repairs two days before fatal journey from Indonesian capital\nLion Air crash: black boxes reveal plane had airspeed problems on last four flights\nData from one of the black boxes retrieved from the Lion Air plane that crashed into the Java Sea last Monday has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights, while admissions from Lion Air have suggested technical difficulties the plane encountered were not isolated to that issue.\nThe new Boeing plane plunged into the sea off the coast of West Java thirteen minutes after takeoff on 29 October killing all 189 on board. The crash was the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia in more than two decades.\nThe head of Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) , Soerjanto Tjahjono, told reporters the Boeing 737 Max plane had suffered similar problems on its last four routes, according to information downloaded from its flight data recorder.\n'Why did it fly?' Grief mixes with anger over crashed Lion Air flight Read more\n\u201cWhen we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or the speed of the plane,\u201d Tjahjono said.\n\u201cData from the black box showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problem,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the black box there were four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator.\u201d\nBut Nyoman Rai Pering, head of Lion Air\u2019s largest engineering facility located in Batam, told the Guardian problems with the plane were not isolated to the airspeed indicators in the days leading up to the crash.\nAsked why the plane had descended from 39,000 feet to 30,000 feet on a flight from Manado to Denpasar on 27 October, and contrary to its regular flying pattern was then grounded for 12 hours, Pering acknowledged the plane had been undergoing repairs during that period.\n\u201cYes, we took time to fix the problem Manado to Denpasar to make sure everything was fixed. We replaced the part suspected by our engineer,\u201d Nyoman said.\n\u201cI think the problem was with the angle of attack, which controls the stability of the aircraft.\u201d\nThe \u201cangle of attack\u201d or AOA indicates whether a plane is going to stall.\nGiven the acknowledged issues with both the angle of attack and airspeed indicators, aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said the problems the jet encountered may be wider that initially believed, and linked to the plane\u2019s air data reference unit (ADR).\nThe ADR takes in several key indicators including airspeed, altitude, air temperature, and the angle of attack.\n\u201cWith all of this happening within a few days we suspect the problem is not just limited to the airspeed indication. This might mean there was an issue with the ADR box as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt might be the ADR itself that was a fault, not those sensors.\u201d\nAmid the ongoing investigation safety experts say it is too early to determine the cause of the crash from Jakarta to tin-mining town of Pankal Pinang.\nAs part of an extended search mission, authorities continued to scour the seabed for the second \u201cblack box,\u201d the cockpit\u2019s voice recorder, in the Java Sea.\n}}

{{Pilots untrained to face that kind of malfunction?\nThe accident of the Boeing B-737 MAX 8 of Ethiopian Airlines (see AVIONEWS), which occurred yesterday morning shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa airport, reopened the case concerning the anti-stall system of the aircraft produced in the United States. As a precautionary measure, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Ethiopia and China have decided to ground all the models of the B-737 MAX 8, also because this incident is similar, in some ways, to the one concerning the same model of aircraft used by the Indonesian Lion Air, which shortly after takeoff crashed into the sea off the coast of Jakarta.\nIn that case the pilot had asked to return to the departure airport due to a technical problem, but during the turn the nose of the plane was beaten automatically due to the entry of the automatic anti-stall system that had detected an angle of wrong wing attachment. Even the Ethiopian Airlines pilot when he, too, asked the Addis Ababa control tower to return to the airport seems to have difficulty controlling the plane and that it has an inconsistency in the relative speed indicators.\nOnly the investigations, however, will be able to clarify if indeed to precipitate The Boeing B-737 MAX 8 was a problem related to the sensors of the angle of attack of the wing, which may have entered the automatic anti-stall system due to an erroneous measurement. It could be a huge blow for the US aerospace company, as it would be for the Ethiopian air carrier because after the Lion Air aircraft incident the pilots should have been trained to remedy this type of malfunction. The \"luck\" is that in this case it will be easier to find the two black boxes, thus allowing to start processing and analyzing the collected data as soon as possible, in order to quickly reach the possible resolution of a possible problem. Investigations will also be attended by a team of technicians from Boeing as well as the National Transport Safety Agency (NTSB), which will support Ethiopian investigators.\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nLast night's episode of Nightline, all about the disappearance of Air France flight 447, featured a perfect nugget of news with which to drum up some renewed interest in the story: The suggestion of a sex scandal involving the plane's captain.\nThe captain, Marc Dubois, who was on a scheduled break when the plane hit heavy weather and the autopilot disengaged, took more than a minute to respond to the crew's calls for help. ABC cites \"two independent sources\" saying Dubois was with off-duty flight attendent Veronique Gaignard at the time. Scandal! The plane would eventually go out of control and crash into the Atlantic on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 aboard.\nBut lest your mind drift to a more recent instance of the captain of a large vessel succumbing to feminine charms rather than doing his job (we're thinking of the narrative that Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino was drinking with a beautiful passenger shortly before the ship crashed) remember that this case is different: Nobody's accusing Dubois of drinking, and the French investigators say they don't think Gaignard had anything to do with the crash. From ABC's online report:\nJean-Paul Troadec, the director of BEA, the French authority conducting the investigation into the Flight 447 crash, told ABC News that Gaignard was not part of their investigation because the agency was \"not interested\" in the \"private life of the pilot.\" Troadec added that he did not think Dubois's alleged relations with Gaignard aboard the plane would have played a role in the accident.\nThe captain could just as easily have been delayed getting to the cockpit because he was sleeping, which is what his break was for. From the information made available so far, it's still impossible for us to know. But since his relationship with Gaignard hadn't been made public until now, it's a strong enough whiff of scandal to work as a news hook. The final results of the investigation into the crash are due out on July 5. Until then, and probably to some extent after as well, all we've got is speculation and rumor.\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\n}}

{{Shares\n, Washington, United States, Mar 13 \u2013 Similarities between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes have focused attention on an anti-stalling system used in the new Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.\nThe Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is an automated safety feature on the 737 Max 8 designed to prevent the plane from entering into a stall, or losing lift.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoth the Lion Air jet, which crashed in October, killing 189 people, and the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft, which went down on Sunday, leaving 157 people dead, were fitted with the system.\nBoth planes experienced similarly erratic steep climbs and descents and fluctuating airspeeds before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), while noting the similarities between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents, stressed that it was too early to draw any conclusions.\nMCAS was introduced by Boeing on the 737 Max 8 because its heavier, more fuel-efficient engines changed the aerodynamic qualities of the workhorse aircraft and can cause the plane\u2019s nose to pitch up in certain conditions during manual flight.\nAngle of attack sensors on the aircraft tell the MCAS to automatically point the nose of the plane down if it is in danger of going into a stall.\nThis is done through horizontal stabilizers on the plane\u2019s tail which are activated by the aircraft\u2019s flight control computer.\nAccording to Boeing, MCAS does not control the plane during normal flight but \u201cimproves the behavior of the airplane\u201d during \u201cnon-normal\u201d situations.\nThese could be steep turns or after takeoff when a plane is climbing with flaps up at speeds that are close to stall speed.\nAccording to the flight data recorder, the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the automated MCAS system repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down following takeoff.\nThe pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines plane reported similar difficulty before the aircraft plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff.\n\u2013 Software updates \u2013\nA preliminary report on the Lion Air Flight 610 accident blamed it in part on a faulty angle of attack sensor that triggered the MCAS system and automatically forced the plane\u2019s nose down.\nPilots flying the same Lion Air plane the previous day had managed to override the automated flight control system.\nBoeing came in for some criticism after the Lion Air crash for allegedly failing to adequately inform 737 pilots about the functioning of MCAS or provide training about the system.\nFollowing the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a bulletin to airlines operating the 737 Max 8 advising pilots how to override the MCAS system.\nThe US aircraft manufacturer issued a statement on Monday saying it was too early to understand the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines accident.\nBoeing also said it was working on software updates to the MCAS system which would be deployed across the 737 Max fleet.\nIt said procedures already exist to \u201csafely handle the unlikely event of erroneous data coming from an angle of attack (AOA) sensor,\u201d the suspected cause of the Lion Air crash.\n\u201cThe pilot will always be able to override the flight control law (MCAS) using electric trim or manual trim,\u201d the aircraft manufacturer said.\nA growing list of countries have grounded their 737 Max aircraft after the two deadly crashes in just five months.\nBoeing has described the Max series as its fastest-selling family of planes, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date from about 100 customers.\nBut not since the 1970s \u2014 when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 suffered successive fatal incidents \u2014 has a new model been involved in two deadly accidents in such a short period.\n}}

The information can be critical in preventing an aircraft from stalling.\nThe doomed plane\u2019s flight data recorder showed that pilots had repeatedly tried to correct its nose from pointing down, possibly after erroneous data from AoA sensors was fed into a system that automatically adjusts some of its movements.\nDubious record\nBlack box data showed the plane also had an airspeed indicator issue on multiple earlier flights, said investigators, who have yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder on the sea floor.\nLion must take steps \u201cto improve the safety culture\u201d and bolster the quality of its flight logs, the transport agency said.\n\u201cAirlines need to take paperwork seriously,\u201d Soejatman said.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t cause the crash, but it can cause other problems in the environment they\u2019re working in.\u201d\nDespite a dubious safety record and an avalanche of complaints over shoddy service, the budget carrier\u2019s parent Lion Air Group has captured half the domestic market in less than 20 years of operation to become Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest airline.\nIndonesia\u2019s aviation safety record has improved since its airlines, including national carrier Garuda, were subject to years-long bans from US and European airspace for safety violations, although it has still recorded 40 fatal accidents over the past 15 years.\nThe report stopped short of making any recommendations to Boeing but the US plane maker has come under fire for possible glitches on the 737 MAX \u2014 which entered service just last year.\nThe APA, a US airline pilots\u2019 union, said carriers and pilots had not been informed by Boeing of certain changes in the aircraft control system installed on the new MAX variants of the 737.\n\u201cI am really surprised if Boeing has not shared all the flight performance parameters with pilots, unions, and training organisations,\u201d University of Leeds aviation expert Stephen Wright told AFP, adding that \u201ca deliberate omission would have serious legal ramifications\u201d.\nSeveral relatives of the crash victims have already filed lawsuits against Boeing, including the family of a young doctor who was to have married his high school sweetheart this month.\nAuthorities have called off the grim task of identifying victims of the crash, with 125 passengers officially recognised after testing on human remains that filled some 200 body bags.\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nA military transport plane that crashed in 1952 was discovered frozen in the ice on Colony Glacier in Alaska. The C-124 Globemaster was en route to Elmendorf Air Force Base 60 years ago when it crashed into the side of Mount Gannett, about 50 miles east of Anchorage.. Rescue teams knew where the plane went down, but snow, bad weather, and avalanches prevented them from ever recovering the wreckage, according to Reuters. Modern day investigators first spotted debris from the crash on top of the glacier on June 10, and have since learned that some of the wreckage did indeed belong to the 1952 crash. Some bone material has been recovered, but no remains of the 52 service members on board have been confirmed or identified. Despite the find, much of the wreckage still isn't recoverable since it's frozen in the ice, but the military unit that specializes in recovering remains of lost personnel will attempt to find and identify any bodies that it can.\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\n}}

{{\nIt's been six months since Asiana Airlines flight 214 crashed at San Francisco International airport. Today, as part of an investigative hearing on the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board has released a comprehensive bank of new photos and video from the tragedy.\nThe photos cover almost every inch of the plane from the cockpit to the rear section where the tail was ripped off, leaving the last rows of seats exposed. In addition to the photos, the agency also released another chilling video of the incident, captured from a camera across the water from the runway:\nDuring the hearing, which began this morning in Washington, DC, the first officer aboard Flight 214 told investigators he called out the plane's excessive sink rate \"more than four times\" in the two minutes before the Boeing 777 smashed into the seawall on the edge of the runway. CNN summarizes some of the details emerging today:\nFirst Officer Bong Dongwon \u2014 who was sitting in a jump seat behind Capt. Lee Kang Kuk, a trainee, and instructor Lee Jungmin \u2014 said the plane was making a steeper descent than the allowable 1,000 feet per minute, so he alerted the pilots, calling out the sink rate. But he did not say anything more because they appeared to be correcting the sink rate, Bong told investigators. [...] A cockpit voice recorder transcript released Wednesday showed the pilot gave three \"sink rate\" warnings in succession about 52 seconds before impact -- the first two times in English, and the final time in Korean.\nIn addition to the sink rate, the pilots may have also have made two other mistakes by approaching too slow and not lining the plane up correctly with the runway.\nThe hearing, which is currently underway in Washington, DC can be livestreamed over at the Mercury News. The full document of NTSB photos can be viewed here.\n}}

{{President Donald Trump lamented the complexity of modern airplanes Tuesday in the wake of two deadly crashes in the past five months, appearing to speculate on the cause of the disasters before aviation experts from the United States and elsewhere complete their investigations.\nThe president commented as much of the world grounded the Boeing 737 Max 8 model involved in both crashes.\nTrump tweeted that \"airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.\" He did not specifically mention the crashes, but his comments come just two days after an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 people aboard and as a cascade of countries worldwide began suspending use of the plane.\n\"Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,\" Trump tweeted. \"All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don't know about you, but I don't want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\"\nThe president's tweet came as lawmakers were examining the future of the aviation industry during a congressional hearing Tuesday morning.\n\"I have a hard time interpreting anything the president says,\" Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., said after reading the tweet aloud. \"I don't know if this is a knock at Boeing, or if it's a knock at pilots or if it's a knock at Einstein, or just that he's a Luddite and it's a knock at technology in general. But it doesn't seem to be the right attitude at this moment.\"\nPatrick Smith, who flies a Boeing 767 aircraft and writes a column called \"Ask the Pilot,\" said Trump's tweet reinforces the false notion that computers are flying the plane while pilots are there as a backup.\n\"People have a vastly exaggerated understanding of what cockpit automation actually does, and how pilots interact with that automation,\" Smith said. \"... The pilots are still flying the plane. They're not flying it in the strictly hands-on way they would have in the 1930s, but you're still commanding, you're still controlling, the aircraft. You have to tell the automation what to do, how to do it and when to do it.\"\nSmith said that even with the most sophisticated airplanes, \"there's always a way to just fall back on raw pilot skills if you need to.\"\nRepublican Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, a pilot, said the president \"has a point\" but \"if you train the pilots to operate the systems, then it's not too complex.\"\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News that \"we have to review and see what actually took place. We know that a lot of the people in the industry have started to voice concerns about the amount of technology and taking the power out of the hands of the pilot. You saw the president talk about that in his tweets earlier today.\"\nSanders also confirmed that Trump did speak by telephone Tuesday with Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. She would not reveal details of what they discussed but said the administration is \"monitoring the situation closely.\"\nAnti-stall technology is suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash in October that killed all 189 aboard. Data released by Indonesian investigators indicates that pilots struggled unsuccessfully to counter the system, which repeatedly pointed the plane's nose down and may have sent it into a death spiral.\nTrump has long had an intense interest in the airline industry, once acquiring a fleet of planes in 1989 from the defunct Eastern Air Lines shuttle business. Time magazine once described the venture as a bust that never turned a profit and eventually defaulted. It was later sold to USAir.\nShortly before Trump came into office, he complained about the cost of new Air Force One planes, tweeting: \"Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"\nA month later, Muilenburg met with Trump and declared they had made \"great progress\" in discussions about holding down the program's cost.\nAssociated Press writer Cathy Bussewitz contributed to this report.\n}}

{{Ethiopian Airlines has grounded all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft as \"an extra safety precaution\" following the crash of one of its planes in which 157 people were killed, a spokesman said Monday, as Ethiopia marked a day of mourning and the plane's damaged \"black box\" of data was found.\nAlthough it wasn't yet known what caused the crash of the new plane in clear weather outside Addis Ababa on Sunday, the airline decided to ground its remaining four 737 Max 8s until further notice, spokesman Asrat Begashaw said. Ethiopian Airlines had been using five of the planes and awaiting delivery of 25 more.\nSome other airlines around the world were deciding to do the same. Aviation authorities in China and Indonesia along with Caribbean carrier Cayman Airways temporarily grounded their Max 8s.\nRed Cross workers slowly picked through the widely scattered debris near the blackened crash crater, looking for the remains of 157 lives. A shredded book. A battered passport. Business cards in multiple languages. Heavy machinery dug for larger pieces of the plane.\nThe plane's \"black box\" of flight data and cockpit voice recorder had been found, Ethiopian Airlines said. An airline official, however, told The Associated Press that the box was partially damaged and \"we will see what we can retrieve from it.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak to the media.\nForensic experts from Israel had arrived to help with the investigation, said Ethiopian Airlines' spokesman Asrat. Ethiopian authorities lead the investigation into the crash, assisted by the United States, Kenya, and others.\n\"These kinds of things take time,\" Kenya's transport minister, James Macharia, told reporters.\nPeople from 35 countries died in the Sunday morning crash six minutes after the plane took off from Ethiopia's capital en route to Nairobi. Ethiopian Airlines said the senior pilot issued a distress call and was told to return but all contact was lost shortly afterward. The plane plowed into the ground at Ejere near Bishoftu.\n\"I heard this big noise,\" one local resident, Tsegaye Reta, told the AP on Monday. \"The villagers said that it was a plane crash, and we rushed to the site. There was a huge smoke that we couldn't even see the plane. The parts of the plane were falling apart.\"\nKenya lost 32 people, more than any country. Relatives of 25 of the victims had been contacted, Mr. Macharia said, and taking care of their welfare was of utmost importance.\n\"Some of them, as you know, they are very distressed,\" he said. \"They are in shock like we are. They are grieving.\"\nCanada, Ethiopia, the U.S., China, Italy, France, Britain, Egypt, Germany, India, and Slovakia all lost four or more citizens.\nLeaders of the United Nations, the United Nations refugee agency, and the World Food Program announced that colleagues had been on the plane. The U.N. migration agency estimated that 19 U.N.-affiliated employees were killed.\nBoth Addis Ababa and Nairobi are major hubs for humanitarian workers, and some had been on their way to a large U.N. environmental conference set to begin Monday in Nairobi. The U.N. flag at the event flew at half-staff.\nThe crash was strikingly similar to that of a Lion Air jet of the same Boeing model in Indonesian seas last year, killing 189 people. The crash was likely to renew questions about the 737 Max 8, the newest version of Boeing's popular single-aisle airliner, which was first introduced in 1967 and has become the world's most common passenger jet.\nSafety experts cautioned against drawing too many comparisons between the two crashes until more is known about Sunday's disaster.\nThe Ethiopian plane was delivered to the airline in November.

Erik \"Speedy\" Gonsalves -- flipped on a wet runway following a \"familiarization flight\" on June 23, 2017 for a fellow Thunderbirds maintenance crew member.\nAt the time, Thunderbirds Commanding Officer Lt. Col. Jason Heard defended Gonsalves' efforts to recover, given the circumstances.\nGonsalves had \"a lot of experience,\" Heard said, with 1,600 flight hours. \"We land in rain all the time.\"\nHeard added, \"From the Thunderbirds that were on scene ... to crash recovery ... to fire department ... it was a tremendous effort. Very impressed and grateful.\"\nThe aircraft, valued at $29 million, was destroyed.\nIn 2016, the Thunderbirds had a mishap after an accidental throttle rotation led to a malfunction and subsequent engine stall that caused the No. 6 jet to crash.\nIt happened after a flyover of the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation on June 2, attended by then-President Barack Obama. The loss of the aircraft cost $29 million.\nIn November, Heard was relieved of command due to loss of confidence in his leadership.\nHe was replaced by Lt. Col. Kevin Walsh, the Thunderbird's 2016-2017 operations officer. The Thunderbirds website says Walsh remains the commander even though Air Combat Command at the time said Walsh was to assume command temporarily.\nHeard was the commander during the 2017 Thunderbirds mishap, but ACC said the leadership change was unrelated to the accident.\nThere have been nine \"class A\" mishaps involving the F-16 since the start of fiscal year 2016. In seven of the mishaps, aircraft were completely destroyed, according to aviation statistics from the Air Force Safety Center. Class A mishaps include fatal accidents, severe damage totaling millions of dollars, or a complete loss of the aircraft.\nNellis has F-16C and F-16D models, Blocks 25, 32, 40, 42 and 52, spokeswoman Maj Christina Suckach told Military.com on Wednesday.\nThe F-16 incident is the latest of several aviation mishaps in the last two days.\nOn Tuesday, a Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter crashed during a training mission in southern California, with all four on board presumed dead.\nAlso Tuesday, a Marine Harrier jet crashed during takeoff from an airport in Djibouti. The pilot was able to eject and was being treated for injuries, officials told Military.com. It's not clear what prompted the pilot's ejection.\nSeparately, another CH-53 \"sustained minor structural damage\" during a landing in Djibouti near Arta Beach, a military spokesman told CNN on Wednesday.\n--Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

{{Commercial airline accidents on French territory are a rare occurrence. At least 150 people on board an Airbus A320 owned by German airline Germanwings are feared dead after the airliner crashed in southern France on Tuesday. The last large-scale aerial tragedy in the country took place on July 25, 2000, when a Concorde jet crashed, causing 113 deaths.\nWhile it has been 15 years since France has witnessed a major aerial accident, it has been even longer since a tragedy comparable to Tuesday\u2019s crash. In 1981, a deadlier accident occurred, with 180 passengers and crew members killed in the French region of Corsica.\nThe most serious crash in France\u2019s history dates back to 1974, when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed soon after takeoff. None of the 346 people on board survived. This was also the fourth deadliest accident in the history of aviation. The Tenerife disaster of 1977, which claimed the lives of 583 people, remains the most fatal.\nThe last time that an Airbus A320 crashed on French soil was in 1992, close to Mont Sainte-Odile.\nHere\u2019s a summary of the worst aerial disasters in France in the past 50 years:\n\u2022 On July 25, 2000, Air France\u2019s Concorde Flight 4590 crashed almost as soon as it took off. The investigation quickly showed that the plane's engines had been on fire when it took off from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport. The crash killed the plane\u2019s 109 passengers and crew on board, as well as four people on the ground. The accident was caused by an explosion at the left rear end of the plane, which ignited the kerosene in the engines.\n\u2022 On Jan. 20, 1992, 87 passengers and crew members died following the crash of an Airbus A320, owned by the French airline Air Inter, in an area called \u201cLa Bloss,\u201d close to Mont Sainte-Odile in Alsace, northeastern France. Only nine people on board survived.\n\u2022 On June 26, 1988, Air France Flight 296 crashed in Habsheim, Alsace, killing three people and leaving 133 injured. This was a test flight that malfunctioned. The plane was carrying journalists and people flying for the first time. It flew at a low speed and a dangerously low altitude, leading to the crash. The aircraft landed in the forest at the end of the runway.\n\u2022 On Dec. 1, 1981, a Yugoslavian chartered jet crashed in Corsica, killing its 180 passengers and crew. A piloting error caused the accident. The plane missed its landing in Ajaccio and then collided with a mountain in the inland region of Propriano.\n\u2022 On March 3, 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed soon after its departure from Orly Airport, killing all 346 people on board. It is believed that the cargo door was not secured properly and broke off in full flight. It is the worst aerial disaster that has taken place on French soil.\n\u2022 On July 11, 1973, a Boeing 707 aircraft owned by the Brazilian airline Varig crashed as it approached Orly Airport. A fire on the plane -- possibly caused by a passenger throwing his cigarette butt in the toilet -- suffocated 123 of the 134 people on board.\n\u2022 On March 5, 1973, a collision in Nantes killed 68 people. An Iberia DC-9 crashed in La Planche after having collided with a Spantax CV-990 aircraft, flight number BX400. While the DC-9 exploded mid-air, the pilots on flight 400 successfully made an emergency landing in Cognac, saving the 108 people who were on board. The crash took place during a strike by air traffic controllers, which left the French Air Force operating the airspace. However, the minister of transportation denied any connection between the accident and the strike.\n\u2022 On Sept. 11, 1968, an Air France Caravelle flying from Nice to Ajaccio crashed off the coast of Nice, causing 95 deaths. The final report of the inquiry commission concluded that the cause of the crash was a fire that originated in the toilets' water heater.\n\u2022 On March 5, 1968, an Air France flight crashed into La Soufriere Mountain while approaching Pointe-a-Pitre Airport in Guadeloupe. The 63 people on board the Boeing 707 died.\n\u2022 On June 3, 1967, an Air Ferry flight crashed into Mount Canigou in the Pyrenees of southern France, an accident caused in part by a navigation error by the pilots. All 88 people on board the DC-4 aircraft died.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that 644 people died in the Tenerife disaster of 1977. The death toll was 583.\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost France and was translated into English.\n}}

{{By David Kaminski-Morrow in London\nCanadian investigators say misunderstanding of laptop performance tool caused 2004 MK 747 freighter accident\nCanadian investigators are recommending the installation of systems to warn crews of inadequate take-off performance following the fatal loss of an MK Airlines Boeing 747-200 freighter during departure from Halifax nearly two years ago.\nIn its final report on the 14 October 2004 crash of MK flight 1602, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) says that the crew\u2019s misunderstanding of a laptop computer tool for calculating take-off performance led to the accident. It concludes that the crew unwittingly transferred and used weight data from the aircraft\u2019s previous flight while calculating performance criteria for the next take-off. The obsolete data misled the crew to derive incorrect thrust settings and critical speeds for take-off.\nAbout two-thirds of the way along Halifax\u2019s runway 24, the aircraft rotated, but failed to become airborne. Its tail struck the ground twice, the second time with just 130m (420ft) of the 2,682m runway remaining. The jet overran the runway by 250m and briefly lifted off for a distance of 100m before it struck an earth berm, the impact severing the tail section and causing the 747 to crash 370m beyond. All seven crew members on board were killed.\n\u00a9 TSB\nComparison of the flight-data recorder (pictured above recovered from the crash scene) information from the Halifax take-off with that from the aircraft\u2019s previous departure, from Connecticut\u2019s Bradley International airport, revealed that the data was \u201cnearly identical\u201d. Both rotations were conducted at 130kt (240km\/h) with 20\u00b0 of flap and the engine data in both cases was similar.\nThis indicates, says the report, that the Bradley take-off weight of just under 240,000kg (530,000lb) was unintentionally used to calculate the aircraft\u2019s take-off performance from Halifax \u2013 despite the additional cargo and fuel making its weight nearly 50% more.\nThe TSB says: \u201cThe Bradley weight in the weight and balance page [of the laptop tool] was likely unknowingly transferred to the performance page due to a reversion feature of the software.\u201d It states that inadequate training on the Boeing laptop tool used by the crew, as well as personal stresses and non-adherence to procedures, contributed to the accident. MK Airlines stopped using the laptop tool two weeks after the crash.\nThe crew was probably suffering from fatigue, says the report, and the departure in darkness would have made the performance error difficult to detect.\nCanadian investigators have acknowledged efforts by Ghana-registered MK Airlines to improve safety.

{{The plane behind Lion Air's crash off Indonesia was one of Boeing's newest and most advanced jets. It was just two months old and with 800 hours under its belt, so experts are baffled as to what exactly caused the 737 MAX 8 to crash.\nWhile no information has been released yet as to why the brand-new plane crashed into the sea 13 minutes after takeoff, FlightRadar24 has published data that shows the plane behaving erratically during takeoff. When a plane would normally be ascending in the first few minutes of flight, the Lion Air jet experienced a 726-foot drop over 21 seconds.\nAviation expert Philip Butterworth-Hayes told CNN that the data was unusual -- especially since takeoffs like this are typically controlled by the plane's automatic systems.\n\"This doesn't fit an automatic flight profile,\" Butterworth-Hayes said while studying the data. \"Unless, the aircraft was trying to correct itself at the time for a number of reasons.\"\n\"This shows an unusually unstable vertical flight profile,\" he added.\n\"Exactly at the same time as the speed increased there was an altitude dip, which meant that at that point there was quite some loss of control.\"\nThe plane, which has only been in operation since August 15, was carrying 181 passengers as well as six cabin crew members and two pilots, bound for Pangkal Pinang on the Indonesian island of Bangka.\nFormer US National Transportation Safety Board air crash investigator and CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz told CNN the data clearly showed issues with both the speed and altitude of the plane.\n\"There is something obviously wrong in both the air speed and the altitude which would point to the flight control systems,\" he said. \"These are fly-by-wire systems -- highly automated -- and pilots may not be able to troubleshoot failures in a timely manner.\"\n'Airplanes don't just fall out of the sky'\nButterworth-Hayes said that given that the plane was only two months old, the reason behind the crash was \"very unlikely\" to be a mechanical fault.\n\"Airplanes don't just fall out of the sky,\" he said. \"I can't think of any mechanical issue apart from a sudden, unexplained loss of engine power (or)complete electrical failure. It's far more likely to be an external event.\"\nHe suggests that an environmental issue is to blame -- such as a microburst, or the plane hitting something like a flock of birds.\n\"Microbursts are very difficult to detect -- they're a sudden down-rush of wind, like a vortex and you can't really see it -- you hit it, suddenly your aircraft isn't performing how it should do, you start doing all sorts of recovery motions and then it's too late.\"\nThe new Boeing 737 MAX 8 made a request to air traffic control to return to the airport around 19 kilometers (12 miles) after takeoff, but did not indicate there was any emergency.\nRadar data did not show that the plane had turned back, and air traffic controllers lost contact with it soon after, Yohanes Sirait, spokesman for AirNav Indonesia, the agency that oversees air traffic navigation, told CNN.\nButterworth-Hayes said that the fact that the pilots had not indicated there was any problems on board suggests there was a minor incident they were dealing with that they were in control of.\n\"Their call suggests it was a minor incident which they were in control of and they didn't require assistance,\" he said. \"But that rapidly escalated.\"\n\"There was an altitude loss (before the flight crashed) and just after that there was obviously some sort of correction,\" Butterworth-Hayes said while looking at the FlightRadar24 data.\n\"Whatever happens to that dip is a correction but whatever that correction was wasn't very long and that's when the plane started falling.\"\nSpeaking earlier with CNN, David Soucie -- a former safety inspector with the US Federal Aviation Administration -- said the fact that an emergency wasn't declared should be a cause for concern.\n\"What's most peculiar to me is the fact that they didn't declare an emergency. They just simply said, 'We're going back,'\" said Soucie, a CNN safety analyst.\n\"But when I look at the track of the aircraft after that, the aircraft made a very steep dive after that, which is not typical of what they would've done,\" he added. \"They would have maintained altitude and made that turn and come back to (the airport).\"\nSoucie added that something had to have happened for the aircraft to lose control.\nHe ruled out weather as a cause of the crash, however, since the plane did not appear to attempt to turn back toward Jakarta. \"That says that something abrupt and very fast happened to the aircraft.\"\nAre pitot tubes to blame?\nPilots on board the plane's previous flight from Denpasar to Jakarta reported technical problems and that the plane was displaying \"unreliable airspeed,\" the deputy chief of Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee, Haryo Satmiko, told reporters, including Reuters, during a news conference on Monday.\nEngineers had checked and repaired the issue, Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Sirait told local media, and that they gave the plane clearance to fly.\nWhen asked about the \"unreliable airspeed\" problem that was reported, Butterworth-Hayes said the pilots would have been reporting an issue with the pitot tubes that determine air speed. Infamously, Pitot tubes were to blame for the Air France Flight 447 crash in 2009 when it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. Ice crystals blocked the plane's pitot tubes, the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react to what was happening.\n\"It reminds me a lot of the aircraft that came down in the Atlantic where you had accelerating speed and a loss of altitude -- which implies there was a sudden loss of control of the aircraft,\" he said.\n\"But if you look at the speed (from data from FlightRadar24), it's pretty constant.\"\nHe says, however, \"Pitot tubes are only one part of the issue -- if pitot tube sensors were showing a different reading from other aircraft sensors this might explain a difference in aircraft performance indications.\"\nBoeing 737 MAX 8 'top of the line, best you can buy'\nThe aircraft was one of 11 of the Boeing planes in Lion Air's fleet. In a statement, Boeing said the company was \"deeply saddened\" by the loss and offered \"heartfelt sympathies\" to passengers and crew on board, and their families.\nSoucie said 800 hours was plenty of time \"to get this tried and true.\"\nHe added the MAX 8 was \"the top of the line, it's one of the best you can buy ... I don't see anything coming back towards maintenance on this issue or the flight of the aircraft itself.\"\nGoelz agreed that the loss of such a new aircraft was \"highly unusual.\"\nBut because Lion Air jet's pilot and co-pilot were experienced -- 6,000 and 5,000 flight hours, respectively -- and weather did not seem to be a factor, investigators would be focusing on the aircraft, he said.\nIndonesian aviation authorities will inspect all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes belonging to the country's commercial airlines, Transportation Ministry official Capt. Avirianto told CNN.\nAvirianto said Garuda's plane was inspected on Monday night. The ministry hoped to inspect at least three of Lion's remaining aircraft Tuesday night and the other eight soon. \"We will checklist one by one, with its system and technical things,\" he said.\nUntil the aircraft's flight data recorders are found and an investigation is held, it's unlikely we'll know much about the cause of the Monday's crash, Aviation consultant and former pilot Alastair Rosenschein told CNN's Becky Anderson.\nRosenschein said it's particularly important to find the black boxes quickly because the plane that crashed was a newer aircraft.\n\"What happened here could possibly affect the same model of aircraft flying in other parts of the world,\" he said.\nUntil those boxes are found, it's unlikely that authorities will be able to figure out what brought down the plane.\nGoelz said the Lion Air crash is yet again another reminder to officials that airlines need better recovery equipment.\n\"I also think it will take a few days to find the date recorders,\" he said, adding it's hard to find things in the ocean.\n\"(It) again highlights the need for more sophisticated tracking and recovery devices.\"\n}}

{{CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Egypt on Wednesday said that it spotted and obtained images from the wreckage of the EgyptAir plane that crashed into the Mediterranean last month, killing all 66 people on board, according to a statement by the country's investigation committee.\nThe committee said that the vessel John Lethbridge, which was contracted by the Egyptian government to join the search for the plane debris and flight data recorders, \"had identified several main locations of the wreckage.\" It added that it obtained images of the wreckage located between the Greek island of Crete and the Egyptian coast.\nThe next step, the committee said, will be drawing a map showing the wreckage location.\nThe vessel is equipped with sonar and other equipment capable of detecting wreckage at depths up to 6,000 feet (1,830 meters).\nThe EgyptAir Airbus A320 en route to Cairo from Paris had been cruising normally in clear skies on an overnight flight on May 19. The radar showed that the doomed aircraft turned 90 degrees left, then a full 360 degrees to the right, plummeting from 38,000 feet (11,582 meters) to 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) before disappearing at about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters).\nLeaked flight data indicated a sensor detected smoke in a lavatory and a fault in two of the plane's cockpit windows in the final moments of the flight.\nThe cause of the crash still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt, Greece, France, the United States and other nations have been searching the Mediterranean Sea north of the Egyptian port of Alexandria for the jet's voice and flight data recorders, as well as more bodies and parts of the aircraft.\nSince the crash began, only small pieces of wreckage and human remains have been recovered in a search that has been narrowed down to five-kilometer (three-mile) area of the Mediterranean.\nEgypt's civil aviation minister has said he believes terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure or some other catastrophic event. But no hard evidence has emerged on the cause, and no militant group has claimed to have downed the jet.\nWednesday's announcement came nearly two weeks after the French ship Laplace detected black box signals from the missing plane.\nLocator pings emitted by flight data and cockpit voice recorders can be picked up from deep underwater. The Laplace is equipped with three detectors designed to pick up those signals, which in the case of the EgyptAir plane are believed to be at a depth of some 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). By comparison, the wreckage of the Titanic is lying at a depth of some 3,800 meters (12,500 feet).\nTen days later, Egyptian investigators said that time is running out in the search for the black boxes. They said on Sunday that only five days remain before the batteries of the flight's data and cockpit voice recorders expire and they stop emitting signals.\nIf retrieved, the boxes could reveal whether a mechanical fault, a hijacking or a bomb caused the disaster. Finding them without the signals is possible but more difficult.\nLast October, a Russian airliner crashed in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula shortly after taking off from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board. A local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for downing the aircraft just hours after the crash. In November, Russia said an explosive device brought down the aircraft.\nThe two disasters have unsettled authorities at the Cairo airport, where false alarms or bomb threats have caused lengthy delays to flights and at least one cancellation last week.\n}}

{{The shocking crash last month of the IAF\u2019s special operations C-130 J aircraft is believed to have been caused by the transporter inadvertently flying into the wake of the lead plane during the tactical training mission, leading to a loss of control at low altitude and the accident that killed all five crew members.\nAdvertising\nPreliminary findings of the detailed inquiry under way point to a \u201cwake turbulence\u201d incident in which the C-130 J, which was part of a two-aircraft formation practising insertion of paratroopers, stalled at a low level after hitting the wake of the lead aircraft.\nThe findings have ruled out any technical fault and suggested that the aircraft failed to adopt a flight path to avoid the massive wake generated by the four engines of the lead C-130 J. An error of judgement by the pilot could have contributed to the incident, the findings suggest.\nThe probability of such a loss of control is particularly high when heavy aircraft are conducting manoeuvres close to the ground. In this case, both aircraft were flying at 300 feet above ground level and had to climb to 1,000 feet when the accident occurred.\nAdvertising\nWhile the lead aircraft of the formation successfully climbed to 1,000 feet after the simulated \u201cdrop\u201d, the second aircraft crashed into a river bed without any warning or distress signal.\nThis, sources said, suggests a sudden, drastic loss of control due to the turbulence generated by the lead C-130 J and is being corroborated by the air crash investigators with data from the flight recorders.\nOnce the inquiry findings are finalised, new safety directives are likely to be generated within the air force to avoid such accidents. The air force had also sought the help of the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, to decipher the voice recorder as well as the flight data recorder.\nThe loss of the air force\u2019s most modern special operations C-130 J aircraft on March 28 was particularly shocking given that the plane had been inducted into the air force in 2010 and was commanded by Wing Commander Prashant Joshi, an experienced pilot and the second in command of the 77 \u2018Veiled Vipers\u2019 squadron.\nHours after taking off as part of a two-aircraft formation from Agra to carry out low-level flying training, the aircraft had apparently grazed a hillock before crashing 116 km west of Gwalior on the Rajasthan-Madhya Pradesh border.\n}}

{{The pilot of a plane that broke up in the sky and crashed into a Yorba Linda neighborhood on Super Bowl Sunday, killing him and four others inside a home, apparently was twice disciplined by the National Transportation Safety Board, according to federal documents.\nFederal Aviation Administration officials confirmed Friday that the pilot of the ill-fated Cessna notified the agency in 1991 that he had changed his name from Jordan Albert Isaacson to Jordan Ike Aaron. In 2008, he told the FAA he again had changed his name, this time to Antonio Peter Pastini.\nNTSB records on file with the Library of Congress show that a pilot with the name Jordan A. Isaacson had his license suspended for 120 days in 1977 for lying to an air traffic controller that he had an instrument rating allowing to him to fly in low-visibility conditions during a trip from Las Vegas to Long Beach, according to federal records.\n\u201cHe allowed his motivation to reach Long Beach to dictate the flight should be made and continued,\u201d Administrative Law Judge Jerrell R. Davis wrote in a decision. He lacked an instrument rating \u2026 and therefore constituted a potential threat to himself, his passenger, and other users of the system.\u201d\nThen, in 1980, Davis suspended the license of a pilot named Jordan Isaacson for 30 days for failing to have a registration certificate aboard his aircraft, missing an annual inspection, and a hydraulic fluid leak that left his wheel brake \u201cunairworthy,\u201d records show.\nFAA officials said they could not confirm that the pilot in the two disciplinary incidents is Pastini because their old records had been purged and they did not immediately have access to the Library of Congress records.\nPastini, a 75-year-old sushi restaurant owner from Gardnerville, Nevada, was flying solo when he took off from Fullerton Municipal Airport in his 1981 Cessna 414A at about 1:35 p.m. Feb.3.\nJust 10 minutes later, the twin-engine aircraft began to break up midflight. Debris from the plane scattered across a neighborhood and smashed into a house in the 19900 block of Crestknoll Drive, causing an explosion and fire that killed four people inside who were having a Super Bowl party.\nInvestigators have not said what could have caused the crash.\nAmid the wreckage, authorities found a badge and identification leading them to initially believe Pastini was a former Chicago police officer.\nHowever, officials with the Chicago Police Department have said there is no record of anyone by the name of Jordan Isaacson or Antonio Pastini ever working for the agency.\nThe badge was reported lost in 1978 and the identification that accompanied it appears to be fake, officials said.\nStill, friends said Pastini frequently represented himself as a former cop.\n\u201cHe would bring it up and was definitely proud of it,\u201d said Charlie Abowd, a friend of Pastini\u2019s who also owns a restaurant in Carson City, Nevada.\nIn 2008, Pastini told the Nevada Appeal newspaper in Carson City that he served in the Chicago Police Department for 21 years and moved west after retiring.\nAnother friend, Wendy Scriven of Carson City, said Pastini also mentioned he was a former Marine. However, Marine Corps officials said there is no record of him serving in the Marines.\nScriven who dined at Pastini\u2019s home where he lived with two dogs and also flew in his plane over Lake Tahoe, said he would hand out brochures offering to take passengers sightseeing if they paid for fuel. \u201cIt was a small plane, but I felt completely safe,\u201d she said.\nPastini also was described as the personal pilot for famed Nevada brothel owner-turned-politician Dennis Hof, who died unexpectedly in October at age 72.\nHof mentioned Pastini\u2019s law enforcement career in a video taken during his Mardi Gras-themed birthday party at a restaurant last year.\n\u201cI love this guy,\u201d Hof shouted into a microphone during the party while Pastini sat among revelers. \u201cA Chicago guy. A Chicago cop.\u201d\nZack Hames, who served as Hof\u2019s executive assistant, said Friday that he and the brothel owner flew without incident about 20 times over the past two years in Pastini\u2019s Cessna, often as part of Hof\u2019s bid for a seat in the Nevada Legislature.\n\u201cIf Dennis wanted to fly in a private plane, that\u2019s who he went with,\u201d Hames said. \u201cHe and Dennis were very close friends.\u201d\nHames recalled Pastini told him in 2018 he experienced engine problems with another plane he owned and had to make an emergency landing.\n\u201cTony said he had a little bit of an issue, but it was all fixed,\u201d he said.\nHowever, FAA officials said other than the Yorba Linda crash, there are no accident records on file for Pastini.\nPastini\u2019s daughter, Torrance resident Julia Ackley, has said her father was a veteran pilot but declined to discuss publicly his name changes or claims of serving in the Chicago police force.\n}}

{{The fact that it has taken President Trump to override his own government\u2019s transportation officials in order to ground the Boeing 737 MAX-8 is an indication that Boeing and the world\u2019s largest regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, have become too close and too complacent about the role of technology in airline safety.\nWhen Canada, with the world\u2019s third largest fleet of MAX-8s, grounded them the FAA was left starkly alone in refusing to act. The Canadians said they acted because new data on the crash Sunday of Ethiopian Airways Flight 302 appeared to confirm similarities with the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October.\nThat data came from a new satellite-based flight tracking system still in testing that was developed as an answer to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Aireon delivered data on the erratic path taken by the Ethiopian jet that the Canadians decided followed the same pattern seen in the final minutes of the Lion Air flight.\nThe same data was provided to the FAA but they did not respond to it with the same urgency shown by the Canadian regulator.\nA total of 346 people died in the two crashes and both are believed to involve a flaw in flight controls that forced the airplanes into a nosedive.\nThe widely held idea that the FAA is the gold standard of aviation regulatory agencies is another of those misplaced beliefs in American primacy based on history rather than current reality.\nIt is true that as the Jet Age was created and grew through a series of brilliant American innovations which set a world standard for the machines that transformed world travel the FAA was an important part of that process.\nAs each leap in design and technology was taken, the FAA developed the world\u2019s most rigorous rules for ensuring passenger safety. Inevitably there was a mutual learning curve between the regulators and the manufacturers.\nThat learning curve was driven by the response to crashes. As each flaw was identified and rectified the rate of fatal crashes was steadily reduced over decades until, in 2017, a remarkable level of safety was reached\u2014in that year for the first time there was not one fatal crash involving a commercial flight in the whole world.\nMuch of this achievement was due to reaching a careful balance between technology and pilots\u2019 skills. It\u2019s often feared that technology has taken over too much from the human factor, a view reflected in Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cairplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.\u201d\nIn fact, technology provides pilots with a level of situational awareness and critical alerts that was unimaginable at the start of the Jet Age.\nAnd that is precisely what makes the MAX-8 catastrophes both anomalous and\u2014probably\u2014egregious. Two such serious crashes within months of each other have reversed what seemed to be an endlessly incremental refinement of airline safety regimes.\nAfter the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October a highly experienced pilot told me: \u201cAviation will move on from this accident, but it represents a watershed event for considering what future pilots will be expected to do, and for what they will or will not be assumed to do.\u201d\nThere is a precursor for the way both the FAA and Boeing have closed ranks to resist grounding a jet with potentially fatal flaws.\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner was a quantum leap in technology, introducing a new level of efficiency for airlines and a new level of comforts for passengers. And it has delivered: the 787 is now so highly rated by frequent flyers that they choose an airline according to whether it offers a 787.\nBut when it first went into airline service the 787 was swiftly overtaken by a problem so serious that it was grounded for three months. The problem was in a new technology that used large lithium-ion batteries to power the airplane\u2019s electrical systems.\n\u201c FAA inspectors embedded at the Boeing plant in Seattle certified that the 787 was safe to fly. \u201d\nTwo Japanese airlines, ANA and Japan Airlines, were first adopters of the 787, and both had serious incidents that led to the grounding. In January, 2013, a Japan Airlines 787 parked at a gate at Boston Logan Airport suffered a battery fire that. took almost two hours to quell.\nNine days later an ANA 787 on a Japanese domestic flight had to make a rapid emergency descent when smoke from a battery fire entered the passenger cabin.\nBoth airlines then grounded their 787s and on the same day the FAA ordered all U.S. airlines flying the 787 to ground them.\nBefore these incidents the Boeing CEO, James McNerney, said that the 787\u2019s problems were normal for a new airplane. However, both Boeing and the FAA had known years earlier how serious a battery fire could be to the 787.\nIn 2010 a 787 on a test flight with more than a score of technicians on board suffered a battery failure so severe that the pilots lost the primary flight displays and auto-throttle controls. The jet made an emergency landing at Laredo, Texas. The pilots and technicians made an emergency evacuation on the runway, using slides. \u201cIf this had happened at 25,000 feet we might be talking about something much more serious\u201d said one observer.\nNonetheless, FAA inspectors embedded at the Boeing plant in Seattle certified that the 787 was safe to fly.\nIn 2013, after the grounding, the National Transportation Board began an investigation into the batteries and their installation in the electronics bay.\nThe batteries were manufactured in Japan by GS Yuasa. The fires were caused by thermal runaways triggered by a short-circuit and were the result of poor quality controls at the Japanese plant. Industry experts warned the NTSB that battery development had moved faster than regulators could keep up with. One said that the battery technology was \u201cvery immature.\u201d\nThen why had the FAA inspectors not seen the problem? The standards the FAA used to certify the batteries were out of date before they were promulgated.\nAs a fix Boeing enclosed the batteries in a steel box. At the same time manufacturing of the batteries was put under stricter quality controls.\nWhile the investigation was going on I interviewed the then-chief of the NTSB, Deborah Hersman. The NTSB has always been a strongly independent agency and Hersman was notable for the tough public stance she took about the 787 problems.\nShe said, \u201cWhat we are seeing in the 787 investigation really raises questions about the certification process\u2014what people should have known at the time\u2026 what did they know in 2007, because we know a lot more now.\u201d\nAnd she issued a warning that resonates today: \u201cThe most frustrating thing for our investigators is, if they go into another accident where they know that if their initial recommendations had been implemented this wouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201c\nHersman gave a specific example: the crash of a ValuJet flight in 1996 in the Florida Everglades that killed all 110 people aboard, caused by the explosion of an oxygen cylinder in the cargo hold. The NTSB had previously warned about hazardous materials in cargo bays but had been ignored by the FAA. \u201cAfter that, we got the response,\u201d said Hersman, \u201cThings that are mandated take a very, very long time to be adopted.\u201d\nAnother former leader of the NTSB, Peter Goelz, told NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on Wednesday, responding to questions about the FAA\u2019s handling of the MAX-8 crisis, \u201cThere are not enough inspectors on the payroll for \u2018gotcha\u2019oversight.\u201d\nHe added that when European regulators grounded the MAX-8 he had such respect for them that it led him for the first time to be concerned about the safety of the MAX-8.\nBoeing\u2019s months of stonewalling after the Indonesian crash followed the pattern set during the early months of concerns about the safety of the batteries on the 787. At times it seemed more like an exercise in corporate damage control than a willingness to concede that, at the very least, they had erred in not disclosing to pilots that the airplane had, buried deep inside its avionics software, a problem that could, if not understood, endanger the airplane.\nAt first the FAA went along with Boeing\u2019s assertion that the Lion Air pilots were to blame because they failed to recognize what was causing the airplane\u2019s controls to force down the nose\u2014a system left out of the flight manual\u2014and failed to resort to flying the airplane manually.\nAstonishingly, neither Boeing nor the FAA showed any sense of urgency about grasping and dealing with the airplane\u2019s obvious defects. But eventually the FAA broke from the Boeing line and insisted that pilot training and manuals should be revised to include the suspect system.\nEven then the FAA remained in lockstep with Boeing in resisting grounding the airplane until President Trump took the decision himself\u2014bipartisan pressure from lawmakers was eventually more persuasive than a phone call from Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg who had assured Trump that the airplane was safe.\n}}

{{Ignore what you\u2019re hearing about San Francisco\u2019s airport and Korea\u2019s air safety culture.\nPhoto by Handout\/Reuters\nOn Saturday afternoon an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport, killing at least two passengers and injuring dozens more, many of them seriously. I\u2019ve been an airline pilot since 1990, and I\u2019d like to offer some perspective on this still-developing story. But before getting to the accident itself, I\u2019d like to express my dismay over the media\u2019s shamelessly sensationalistic coverage of it. A certain degree of network hyperventilation always follows air crashes, but this time, from the absurd eyewitness accounts to the at times wildly inaccurate commentary of various aviation \u201cexperts,\u201d they\u2019ve taken things to a new level of inanity and poor taste.\nOne thing sorely missing from the coverage thus far has been a sense of perspective. I don\u2019t mean to diminish the seriousness of what happened. It\u2019s a tragedy when anybody is killed in an airplane crash. However, the vast majority of the passengers on Asiana Flight 214 made it off the airplane alive. This simply was not an air disaster of the scale that was once relatively common and is not deserving of terms like \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\nIt is imperative to remember that Saturday\u2019s accident was the first multiple-fatality crash involving a major airline in North America since November 2001. (There have been a handful involving regional affiliates, but the majors have been virtually accident-free). The streak has ended, but it lasted nearly 12 years, with some 20,000 commercial jetliners taking off and landing safely in this country every single day\u2014an astonishing run. Is it perverse to suggest that Saturday\u2019s accident, awful as it was, serves to underscore just how safe commercial flying has become? That\u2019s asking a lot, I know, in this era of race-to-the-bottom news coverage, when speed and sizzle, not accuracy or context, are all that really count.\nBut consider for a moment the year 1985, one of the darkest ever for commercial air travel. By the end of that year, 27 crashes had resulted in the deaths of almost 2,400 people. These included the Air India bombing over the North Atlantic, with 329 casualties, and, two months later, the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 outside Tokyo, with 520 dead. (These, the second- and fifth-deadliest incidents in aviation history, happened 49 days apart.) Also in 1985 were the Arrow Air disaster in Newfoundland that killed more than 240 U.S. servicemen, the infamous British Airtours 737 fire, and the crash of a Delta Air Lines L-1011 in Dallas that killed 137.\nNow, as for what may have happened in San Francisco: About the worst thing we can do at the moment is play fast and loose with speculation. Early theories as to why a plane crashed almost always turn out to be wrong or incomplete. All we know for certain is that the plane crashed short of the runway. That by itself is not a reason for the accident; it\u2019s the result of something else gone wrong.\nBased on what the National Transportation Safety Board and other sources have reported thus far, the pilots found themselves in the throes of an unstable approach\u2014apparently below the proper glide path and at too low a speed\u2014and failed to correct or abandon the approach in time. They initiated a go-around\u2014a fairly routine maneuver, referred to by some people as an \u201caborted landing,\u201d in which the approach is broken off and the jet climbs away for a second attempt\u2014but it was too late. How or why they got themselves in this position, and why they did not correct or abandon the landing sooner, remains unknown.\nReportedly, Flight 214\u2019s captain was new to the aircraft, and had accrued fewer than 50 total hours in the 777 prior to the accident. While much is being made of this, to me it\u2019s a red herring. Pilots transition from aircraft type to aircraft type all the time, and it\u2019s not uncommon for a pilot to have a limited number of hours in whichever plane he or she has most recently qualified in. But experience in a particular model and experience overall are different things. All airline pilots are highly trained and are highly experienced before they ever set foot in a jetliner cockpit.\nWhat\u2019s more, there is always a minimum of two pilots in the cockpit, a captain and a first officer\u2014the latter is referred to colloquially as the \u201cco-pilot.\u201d Both are fully qualified to operate the aircraft, and they share flying duties; first officers perform just as many takeoffs and landings as captains do. It\u2019s not yet clear which Asiana pilot was physically at the controls, the captain or first officer. In any case, either pilot would have been in a position to note and correct for deviations, or to execute a go-around maneuver. Why this didn\u2019t happen we don\u2019t know.\nWhether transitioning from one type of aircraft to another or upgrading from first officer position to captain, pilots undergo a full, aircraft-specific training regimen, often lasting several weeks. This includes classroom training as well as hands-on instruction in both cockpit mock-up trainers and full-motion simulators. Once this phase is complete, all pilots fly the actual aircraft for a period of time under the watch and guidance of a training captain.\nWe\u2019ve also been hearing about the supposedly hazardous SFO airport. Many in the media have been harping on the fact that the airport\u2019s runways crisscross and are spaced close together, and that the instrument landing system (ILS) of the runway Asiana crashed on had been out of service, requiring the crew to fly a \u201craw\u201d visual approach. Could this have been a factor?\nTo some extent, yes. This would have made the arrival trickier than normal. Even with all navigational equipment working, arrivals into SFO can be challenging. But that by no means made the arrival pattern unsafe. As in all lines of work, some aviation tasks are more difficult and work-intensive than others. All pilots are trained to handle the sorts of challenges SFO presents, and visual approaches, which do not rely on instrument guidance to the extent of the more common ILS approach, are common at large and busy airports. The lack of instrument guidance, together with SFO\u2019s high-workload environment, may have been a contributing factor, but this alone does not excuse or explain landing short of a runway.\nAlready I\u2019m speculating more than I intended to. Whether this was human error, mechanical failure, or some combination of the two remains to be determined. In the meantime, I would caution readers to be leery of what you hear from TV or the press, and be exceptionally wary of on-air testimony from eyewitnesses or passengers who were aboard the jet. The news channels salivate over these firsthand narratives, but any crash investigator will attest to the notorious unreliability of such accounts. If some of the things I\u2019ve heard in interviews over the past 24 hours are any indication, stuff your ears with gauze and leave the room when an eyewitness starts talking. I don\u2019t want to insult anybody\u2019s powers of observation, but passengers have a terrible habit of misjudging and misinterpreting the basics of flight even when things are running perfectly normal, never mind in the throes of a violent emergency.\nMeanwhile, looking at some of the footage from Saturday, I was appalled by the number of passengers who chose to evacuate the burning aircraft with their carry-on luggage. We\u2019ve seen this in several on-the-runway evacuations in recent years. I understand that reaching for one\u2019s valuables is human nature, and that people don\u2019t always behave rationally in a crisis, but lugging your carry-ons down the aisle in the middle of an emergency evacuation, when seconds can mean the difference between life and death, is reckless. You\u2019re endangering your own life and the lives of those people behind you. And those escape slides are much higher and steeper than it appears on television. They are not designed with convenience in mind. They are there to get a planeload of people out of, and away from, the aircraft as quickly as possible\u2014without their belongings. When you slide, you slide very fast, and jumping into a slide with your belongings places physical obstacles directly in the path of others. Although cabin crew are trained to command people to leave their things behind, there\u2019s only so much they can do without slowing things down even further.\nLastly, we\u2019re hearing murmurs already about the fact that Asiana Airlines hails from Korea, a country with a checkered past when it comes to air safety. Let\u2019s nip this storyline in the bud. In the 1980s and 1990s, that country\u2019s largest carrier, Korean Air, suffered a spate of fatal accidents, culminating with the crash of Flight 801 in Guam in 1997. The airline was faulted for poor training standards and a rigid, authoritarian cockpit culture. The carrier was ostracized by many in the global aviation community, including its airline code-share partners. But Korean aviation is very different today, following a systemic and very expensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s civil aviation system. A 2008 assessment by ICAO, the civil aviation branch of the United Nations, ranked Korea\u2019s aviation safety standards, including its pilot training standards, as nothing less than the highest in the world, beating out more than 100 other countries. As they should be, Koreans are immensely proud of this turnaround, and Asiana Airlines, the nation\u2019s No. 2 carrier, had maintained an impeccable record of both customer satisfaction and safety.\nWhatever happened on final approach into SFO, I highly doubt that it was anything related to the culture of Korean air safety in 2013. Plane crashes are increasingly rare the world over. But they will continue to happen from time to time, and no airline or country is 100 percent immune.\n}}

Boeing faces troubling questions after second crash in five months Boeing issued a safety warning last November about its new 737 Max jets which could have a fault that causes them to nose-dive. The special bulletin sent to operators was about a sensor problem flagged by Indonesian safety officials investigating the crash of a Lion Air 737 that killed 189 people just a week before the memo was sent. Since the 737 Max was unveiled in 2017, 350 of the jets have been bought, with around a further future 4,761 orders placed. More than 40 airlines around the world use the 737 Max, which has four kinds in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10. Airlines such as Norwegian Air, Air China, TUI, Air Canada, United Airlines, American Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Icelandair and FlyDubai. The 8 series, which was involved in the crash in Indonesia, has been flying the longest of all the Maxes. Boeing said in November that local aviation officials believed pilots may have been given wrong information by the plane's automated systems before the fatal crash. An AOA sensor provides data about the angle at which wind is passing over the wings and tells pilots how much lift a plane is getting. According to a technical log the Lion Air plane, which had only been in service a few months, suffered instrument problems the day before because of an 'unreliable' airspeed reading. The MAX models are relatively new but has already been investigated after problems reported. Pictured: Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 (stock image) Minutes after takeoff the plane suddenly nose-dived hitting speeds of 600mph before slamming into the sea. The warning issued today read: 'The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee has indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced erroneous input from one of its AOA (Angle of Attack) sensors. 'Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor.' As a result of an investigation into the crash the jet manufacturer is said to be preparing a bulletin to be sent to operators of the 737 jets warning about faulty cockpit readings that could cause a dive. The notice refers to the 'angle of attack', which is the angle of the wing relative to oncoming air stream, a measure that indicates if a plane is likely to stall. This angle of attack, which is a calculation of the angle at which the wind is passing over the wings, is used to be determined if a stall is imminent. Inspectors found faults on two other Boeing 737 MAX jets, including one which mirrored a problem reported on board the Lion Air plane.\nMr Toole said she had flown around the world but added: 'Personally I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes'.\nHe said: 'Joanna's work was not a job - it was her vocation. She never really wanted to do anything else but work in animal welfare since she was a child.\n'Somehow that work took her into the international sphere and for the last 15 years she has been working for international animal welfare organisations.\n'That involves a lot of travelling around the world - although personally I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes.\n'I'm an environmental campaigner myself, so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it's a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky.\n'Joanna was a very soft and loving person. Everybody was very proud of her and the work she did. We're still in a state of shock.\n'Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about.

Instability at that point e.g. too slow - could destabilise the aircraft, potentially risking stalling and other hazardous consequences. It might indicate the pilots had difficulty controlling the climb\/ascent.'\nAn experienced pilot told MailOnline the activity was highly unusual.\nHe said: 'A positive number indicates the aircraft is going up. After takeoff you would expect all these numbers to be positive as the aircraft climbed away from the ground, or zero if they are flying level.\n'The small amount of data released so far indicates that after only one minute or so of the flight this aircraft started a descent at a rate of up to 1920 feet per minute down. If the data is correct that is extremely unusual.\n'The data then shows the aircraft going up and down until the data stops.

It was unclear if the company had made any changes.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Boeing said it was 'deeply saddened' to learn of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\nIndonesian emergency services carry a body bag in the wake of the Lion Air disaster last year\n'A Boeing technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board,' the company said.\nThe state-owned Ethiopian Airlines calls itself Africa's largest carrier and has ambitions of becoming the gateway to the continent.\nThe airline does have a better safety rating and a newer fleet than some neighbouring operators - a number of African airlines are banned outright from EU airspace including the flag-carrier of neighbouring Eritrea.\nBut in addition to 16 fatal incidents costing 102 lives in the 1960s, 70s, and 1980s; the airline has now suffered six fatal incidents in the last thirty years, including other two huge tragedies.\nIn 1996 after a hijacking and a failed water landing, 125 people died on Flight 961 in Moroni, the capital of the Union of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean.\nAnd in January 2010, 82 passengers and eight crew died when EA flight 409 from Beirut to Addis Ababa slammed into the Mediterranean shortly after take-off.\nBoeing's 737 is the world's most-sold passenger jet family and is considered one of the industry's most reliable.\nThe MAX 8 is the latest version of the aircraft, which Boeing rolled out in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737.\nBy the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft.\n}}

{{LE BOURGET, France - A severely bruised young girl believed to be the only survivor of an Indian Ocean plane crash flew back Thursday to Paris, where she was embraced gently by her father, who tried to lift her spirits with a joke.\nBahia Bakari, 14, returned to France from the Comoros Islands on a French government plane. The Falcon-900 jet with medical facilities left the archipelago nation, a former French colony, and arrived at Le Bourget airport just north of Paris.\nYemenia Flight 626 crashed Tuesday morning off Comoros amid heavy winds. Bahia, described by her father as a fragile girl who could barely swim, spent over 13 hours in the water clinging to wreckage before she was rescued. She was found suffering from hypothermia, a fractured collarbone and widespread bruises to her face, her elbow and her foot.\nThe other 152 people on the plane, including her mother and others from France's large Comoran community, are presumed dead.\nAnger over the crash ran high Thursday in France's Comoran community. In Marseille, hundreds of shouting demonstrators tried to block passengers from boarding a Yemenia airlines flight to Moroni, the Comoros capital. Police broke up the protest but there were no injuries.\n\"We don't want any more Yemenia flights as long as justice has not been done,\" said Farid Solihi, president of \"SOS Trips to the Comoros,\" a group seeking to draw attention to what they call poor conditions on Yemenia flights.\nIn the Comoros, French and U.S. ships and officials directed the search for survivors. Alain Baulin, a commander with the French Foreign Legion, said military planes spotted what appear to be life jackets floating in the sea Thursday and divers were sent to the scene.\nTelevision station France 2 carried a brief interview with Bahia on the plane coming home Thursday. She appeared dazed and gave mostly one-word answers. Asked how she felt, the teenager, who could barely open one of her black-and-blue eyes, replied faintly \"Well.\"\nWhen asked if she is worried, she said: \"A little bit, a little bit.\"\nOne of the medical workers accompanying her on the flight told France 2 that Bahia had not talked to them about what happened.\nBahia's father, Kassim, met her as she arrived, saying he was relieved and overjoyed to see his daughter even as he mourned his wife.\n\"It was very powerful,\" he said of his reunion with Bahia. He said he asked her, \"'How are you? Was the return trip OK?' ... We joked a little, the two of us.\"\n\"I took her in my arms and I embraced her, but not too strongly because her collarbone is injured,\" he said later on France-24 television.\nSeveral other family members joined the airport reunion before an ambulance took the girl to the Armand-Trousseau Children's Hospital in eastern Paris.\nAt that hospital, Dr. Isabelle Constant said Bahia was suffering from multiple, moderately serious contusions and burns that require specialized care but her life was not in danger. Bahia and her close family members were also receiving psychological care, a hospital statement said.\n\"In the midst of the mourning, there is Bahia. It is a miracle, it is an absolutely extraordinary battle for survival,\" France's co-operation minister, Alain Joyandet, who flew back with her, said at the airport. \"It's an enormous message that she sends to the world ... almost nothing is impossible.\"\nJoyandet said Bahia was told \"that her mother is missing. She is facing up to this event in a very brave way.\"\nBahia, the eldest of four children, had boarded a plane in Paris with her mother, Aziza, on Monday morning for a long journey via Marseille and San'a, Yemen, to Comoros where they planned to spend part of the summer with relatives. Her three siblings had stayed behind with her father.\nJoyandet said the girl recounted her ordeal a bit to him.\n\"She says instructions were given to passengers and that then she felt something like electricity ... as if she had been a bit electrocuted,\" Joyandet said. \"And suddenly there was this big sound. She found herself in the water.\"\n\"She said she was afraid when she couldn't see her mama,\" her father told France-24. \"She was a bit panicked.\"\nAt one point, he said, Bahia fell asleep, clinging to a piece of debris.\nThe French air accident investigation agency BEA sent a team of investigators and Airbus experts to Comoros, an archipelago of three main islands 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometres) south of Yemen, between Africa's southeastern coast and the island of Madagascar.\nFrance's transport minister, Dominique Bussereau, was quoted as saying Thursday in the Le Figaro daily that \"worrying anomalies\" in the crashed Airbus A310 jet included broken seats for crew and passengers, out-of-date operation manuals, insufficient pressure on emergency exit doors and unrestrained equipment in the baggage hold. French aviation authorities flagged the problems with the plane during a 2007 inspection.\nYemenia's lawyer in France, however, said it was too early to say that the plane's condition was the cause of the accident.\nOff the coast of the Comoros islands, ships searched for survivors, bodies and wreckage Thursday, even as hope faded of finding anyone alive in the choppy seas.\n\"Up to this moment, there have been no bodies, nor any other survivor,\" said Jean Youssouf, director-general of El Maarouf Hospital in Moroni. \"Do we continue to hope to find survivors? Yes, we will continue to hope.\"\nIn the coastal town of Mitsamiouli, about 19 miles (30 kilometres) from Moroni, rescue boats went to sea. Dozens of Red Crescent tents were set up on shore and about 100 French, American, Yemeni and Comoran military personnel aided the search effort.\n\"(Because of) the wind, the rough sea, we have not been able to recover any bodies,\" said Ramoulati Ben Ali, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent Society of Comoros.\nThe search results \"have been disappointing,\" admitted Bertrand Mortemard de Boisse, commander for the French military in the southern Indian Ocean. He said currents and winds were scattering the debris and bodies.\nA 16-member U.S. search-and-rescue team arrived in Moroni late Wednesday to help, and two French military ships and an Italian frigate on anti-piracy patrols were diverted to help.\nTales of sole survivors of plane crashes are rare, but not unheard of.\nIn 2006, only Martin Farkas survived when Slovak military plane went down in northeastern Hungary, killing 42 people. And in 1987, 4-year-old Cecelia Cichan was the only survivor when an American Northwest Airlines flight crashed while trying to take off from Detroit, killing 156 people.\n___\nMaliti reported from Moroni, Comoros.

A spokesperson tells News 6 students are no longer required to train on them.\nCapra's father, John Charles Capra, said in the wrongful death lawsuit that the \"horror and fear of impending death for pilots of an in-flight breakup of their aircraft cannot be overstated.\" He called it a \"pilot's worst nightmare come true.\"\nAccording to the lawsuit, Capra's attorney is claiming the company knew of structural failures in the Piper PA-28 aircraft since at least 1987 after another plane with a similar flight history crashed and the pilot died.\nThe suit states after the 1987 crash, the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive that required extensive inspection of the wings. The suit claims Pipier lobbied the FAA to have the order withdrawn.\nThe lawsuit states that made \"the unilateral decision to risk the lives of every pilot and aircraft owner.\"\nThe suit also claims Piper knew for years before the 1987 crash that \"more than a hundred PA-28 aircraft had suffered in-flight structural failures resulting in the loss of life of hundreds of occupants,\" the lawsuit states.\nCapra's attorney claims Piper no longer sends notices to pilots or owners requiring more serious inspections of the aircraft.\nREAD -- Civil lawsuit filed against Piper Aircraft\nAccording to the lawsuit, another plane at Embry Riddle was inspected after the fatal crash and it had a similar crack in the wing.\nPiper did not respond to questions about the lawsuit, which can be read in the link above.\nCopyright 2019 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.\n}}

{{Investors need to do their own homework, but there are worse ways to learn about markets than by paying attention to the world's most successful money managers.\nThis week, hedge-fund legend and global philanthropist George Soros opined that the European Union is on the verge of collapse. Do other billionaire investors share his fear, and could that fear mean a global crash is on the horizon? Read on to find out what three of the planet's smartest investors are thinking.\nSoros shatters markets\nWarren Buffett may be the go-to buy-and-hold investor, but perhaps no single money manager has had as big of an impact on global markets as George Soros. Soros has been investing and profiting from ever-shifting market tides since the 1950s. His rapid-fire investment approach, passion for international affairs, and savvy market timing is the stuff of legend.\nAlthough Soros has had many market successes during the past 60 years, his bet against the British Pound in the 1990s -- a move that broke the back of the Bank of England -- is a great example of Soros' uncanny ability to connect the dots between policy and profit. Unfortunately for investors, Soros' track-record makes his recent prognostication that the EU is on shaky footing even more dire.\nIn an interview with Gregor Peter Schmitz for the New York Review of Books, Soros said:\nThere is plenty to be nervous about. As she [Angela Merkel] correctly predicted, the EU is on the verge of collapse. The Greek crisis taught the European authorities the art of muddling through one crisis after another. This practice is popularly known as kicking the can down the road, although it would be more accurate to describe it as kicking a ball uphill so that it keeps rolling back down.\nSoros went on to back up that image of futility by describing a slate of troubles facing the EU stretching from the never-ending Greek financial crisis to risks stemming from Eastern European leadership and Syrian migration. Given it's the EU, not the U.S., that's the biggest global economy, Soros' worry of economic doom in the region would seem to indicate he's similarly concerned about the EU's potential impact on American stock, currency, commodity, and bond markets, too.\nRogers' ramblings\nSoros' former investment partner Jim Rogers may not work with Soros anymore, but he remains one of the biggest and most influential long-term global investors. Rogers is perhaps best known for embracing China early on in its economic expansion, and in an interview earlier this month on Bloomberg, Rogers said he was \"worried about the world,\" citing Japan and the EU as major reasons for concern.\nRogers went on to describe China as a victim of, rather than the cause of, global economic weakness. He also said that China, which has more debt on its books than before the Great Recession, is less of a concern to him than other more highly indebted parts of the world.\nAs a result, Rogers says he is short the U.S. stock market, short U.S. junk bonds, long the U.S. dollar, and long China, in spite of the country's short-term struggles.\nBogle's bias\nIn the 1970s, Jack Bogle turned the investment universe on its ear by creating the modern index mutual fund at his now widely known Vanguard Group. Today, Vanguard has roughly $3 trillion (yes, trillion) dollars under management, the bulk of which are invested in index funds.\nUnlike Soros and Rogers, both of whom have ostensibly shifted their investments to reflect their gloomy outlook, Bogle recommends that investors \"do nothing.\" In an appearance on CNBC this week, he reminded investors that reacting to the market's inevitable machinations with decisions to curb monthly investments could result in investors paying a huge price in the long run.\nThat advice has merit given that the U.S. stock market has historically gone on to reach new highs after crashes, including in the wake of both the Internet Bust and the Great Recession.\nKeeping perspective\nThreats to global economies remain, and those threats could cause a slowdown in corporate profits that may lead to lower share prices. However, even Soros won't go as far as to claim that all is lost.\nAt his core, Soros is an optimist. After outlining the risks facing the EU, Soros also said:\nI trained myself to look at the dark side. It has served me well in the financial markets and it is guiding me now in my political philanthropy. As long as I can find a winning strategy, however tenuous, I don't give up. In danger lies opportunity. It's always darkest before dawn.\nTempering talk of doom and gloom with a healthy dose of optimism has served investors well in the past, and that suggests that Bogle's advice may be the most worth following.\n}}

Image Credit: Reuters\nGEORGETOWN, Guyana - Ten people were injured in scenes described as \"chaos\" as a Boeing airliner carrying 126 people, most of them Canadians, crash-landed in Guyana's capital Georgetown on Friday, skidding to a halt just before a steep drop.\nThe Fly Jamaica Airways plane was bound for Toronto when it suffered a hydraulic problem shortly after takeoff and returned to the airport, crashing and careening off the runway, Transportation Minister David Patterson said.\n\"Everyone was going crazy, screaming, crying for their lives, everything,\" said passenger Invor Bedessee, describing how some people were injured getting off the flight.\n\"There were (some people) injured because of coming down the slide or not getting off the flight fast enough, so the people behind them were kicking them,\" he told Canada's public broadcaster CBC.\n\"There was a lot of chaos.\"\nBedessee said takeoff had been delayed by about 45 minutes because one of the left-side doors had \"not closed properly\" and a maintenance crew was called to fix the problem.\nPatterson said the injuries were not life-threatening and the injured were taken to a hospital near the airport on the South America country's Atlantic coast.\nSPINAL INJURIES\nGuyana's Chief Medical Officer, Shamdeo Persaud, said 5 of the injured had been referred to another hospital for \"further investigation\" for spinal injuries.\nThe 118 passengers on board the Boeing 757-200 included 82 Canadians. There were 8 crew members.\n\"To date, we have no reports of any Canadian citizens being injured,\" said government spokesman Philip Hannan in Ottawa.\n\"Canadian consular officials are in contact with local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance to Canadian citizens if needed.\"\nAfter departing at 2:10 am (0610 GMT), the pilot reported a problem with the hydraulic system 10 minutes into the flight.\n\"We flew about 10, 15 minutes in the air, just over the Atlantic ocean, and we were circling around a few times and the captain announced there's some hydraulic problems, and we had to return to the airport,\" Bedessee told CBC.\n\"When we landed on the ground, the wheels were still spinning, they were not braking, there was no hydraulic brakes to brake the wheels and then we overshot the runway,\" the still-shaken passenger said.\nPictures showed the plane had ground to a halt in the sand just short of a steep incline.\n\"One of the wings came apart and the engine on the right side actually flipped over and we crashed into a big sand pile at the edge of a cliff. There's a big drop about 30, 40 feet (nine to 12 meters) on the other side,\" said Bedessee.\n\"If we had 10 more feet, we would be down in the cliff, down in the ditch. It was a miracle.\"\nA resident told AFP that she heard a loud explosion and when she went outdoors, she saw smoke.\n\"I saw bright lights and smoke, heard sirens, people screaming. I saw the plane turn off in an angle but before that I heard a loud explosion,\" Melana Perreira said.\n'A LOT OF CHAOS'\nBedessee said the incident had left him \"very shaken and very, I don't know, nervous.\"\n\"It's like all of my goose bumps are going crazy, just it's a shock and awe, more or less,\" he said.\nDirector-General of the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority, Egbert Field, said the pilots of the aircraft had not yet been interviewed but the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder had been removed from the wrecked plane and sent to the United States for analysis.\n\"They have been retrieved and will be sent to the National Transportation Safety Board for decoding,\" Field said.\nGuyanese police and soldiers secured the crash site for investigators to begin working.\n\"We can confirm that Fly Jamaica flight OJ256 bound for Toronto has returned to Georgetown with a technical problem and has suffered an accident on landing,\" the airline said.\n}}

{{MEXICO CITY \u2014 An Aeromexico jetliner crashed while taking off during a severe storm in northern Mexico on Tuesday, smacking down in a field nearly intact then catching fire, but officials said everyone on board escaped alive.\nGov. Jose Aispuro, who had initially reported there were no deaths but later said authorities were searching the charred Embraer 190 to make sure, announced late Tuesday that \u201cno person has died.\u201d\nHe said the pilot and one other person were in serious but stable condition. Earlier, he said a total of 49 people had been taken to hospitals, and officials said most had minor injuries.\n\u201cFortunately we have now found all 103 \u2014 now we know where each one is \u2014 this gives us a lot of tranquility,\u201d Aispuro said.\nThe federal government earlier said 101 people were on the plane, 97 passengers and four crew members. But the governor said two minors had not been included in the first tally.\nThe state civil defense office published photos of a burning but relatively intact plane lying on its belly in a field. Ambulances lined up at the accident site to ferry the injured to hospitals. The governor said some passengers got out under their power, and some even wandered back to the nearby airport of Durango city to seek out relatives.\nOfficials and witnesses differed on whether the plane either fell shortly after takeoff or ran off the runway without really gaining altitude. But they agreed the plane was trying to take off during a storm, with some describing marble-sized hail.\nThe governor said a gust of wind hit the plane shortly after it took off, causing the jet to lose speed and hit the ground with its left wing, knocking both engines loose. He said the plane skidded into a field in a horizontal position, which allowed escape slides to activate so all passengers and crew could escape before the plane caught fire.\nIsrael Solano Mejia, director of the Durango city civil defense agency, told Foro TV that the plane \u201cmade it off the ground, but fell nose-first\u201d just a few hundred yards from the end of the runway.\n\u201cThe nose took the hit. The most seriously injured is the pilot,\u201d Solano Mejia said. However, he said, \u201cthe majority of passengers left (the plane) under their own power.\u201d\nThe federal Transport Department office said in a press statement that the airplane \u201csuffered an accident moments after takeoff,\u201d but gave no information on the possible cause.\nAeromexico said the flight was AM2431 from Durango to Mexico City.\nThe web site Planespotters.net said the Brazilian-made medium-range Embraer 190 was about 10 years old and had seen service with two other airlines before joining the Aeromexico fleet.\nOperations were suspended at Guadalupe Victoria airport after the crash.\n}}

{{Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nThe latest photos from the set of Captain Marvel show the construction of an aircraft crash site and promise more footage and images to come from the 2019 Marvel movie. Though Avengers: Infinity War didn't introduce Carol Danvers to the MCU as some speculated it would, the post-credits scene teased her arrival. With Ant-Man 2 and Captain Marvel set before Avengers 3, there's no telling how the next two Marvel Studios films will play into Avengers 4. But the cosmic scope of Captain Marvel and the Kree-Skrull War it will bring to life promise a lot of ramifications for Phase 4.\nA new rumor suggests Captain Marvel will be a game-changer on an even larger scale than Avengers: Infinity War. While there's not much concrete to support this, it's also not hard to imagine. Between the introduction of one of Marvel's most powerful heroes, an exploration of the Quantum Realm from the Ant-Man franchise, and an intergalactic battle that's apparently been a secret since the early '90s, it's clear that things won't be quite the same when Danvers reveals herself to the Avengers. And with production for the film in full swing, we're finally getting a look at what Captain Marvel will entail.\nBass Lake Summer (via ComicBookMovie) captured two new videos from the set of Captain Marvel. Shot at Shaver Lake, the footage shows what looks to be a plane crash (something BLS also notes in the second video) along the shore. Though not many details can be discerned from the footage, there's a good chance this is tied to Danvers' work in the military. Of course, a big crash scene could also mean an encounter with one of the movie's extraterrestrial forces. Take a look at the videos below.\nStopping by to watch the movie crews of the new Marvel Comic movie with Samuel L. Jackson at Shaver Lake Posted by Bass Lake Summer on Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nAnother video I took of the simulated military plane crash scene on the \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d movie set at Shaver Lake yesterday. by Elizabeth Christie Posted by Bass Lake Summer on Wednesday, May 9, 2018\nThe construction in the videos also indicates more photos and videos should be arriving soon involving actual filming. Hopefully then, we'll get a better idea of what type of aircraft is involved. This isn't the first transportation-related action sequence we've seen a glimpse of either. A Captain Marvel set video from last week showed Brie Larson atop a train battling a foe. And considering Gemma Chan began filming the same day, it could be Captain Marvel was squaring off against Minn-Erva.\nAlong with the various images and videos from the set, we also recently learned Annette Bening has joined Captain Marvel. Though her official role hasn't been disclosed, one source claimed she'd be playing a scientist while another said she was cast as Carol's mother. Likely, both will prove to be true and the elder Danvers will be getting a rewrite from the comics and will be part of the film's scientific subplot (Minn-Erva's alter-ego is the Earth scientist Dr. Minerva).\nThe last minute casting of Bening may also mean more additions to the film have yet to be announced, so fingers crossed that Peggy Carter will be in Captain Marvel after all. With the returns of Fury, Coulson, Ronan, and Korath, it'd be a shame for Agent Carter to not show up in the film, so perhaps another big reveal is around the corner. Either way, the movie's fast-approaching release date means fans can expect more behind-the-scenes looks at Captain Marvel in the near future.\nSource: Bass Lake Summer (via ComicBookMovie)\nJoss Whedon Calls Henry Cavill Best Superman Since Christopher Reeve\n}}

{{NEW YORK \u2013 United States regulators reversed course Wednesday and announced they will ground Boeing Co.\u2019s top-selling 737 Max family of airliners amid safety concerns after a crash Sunday in Ethiopia \u2013 five months after a similar tragedy off Indonesia.\n\u201cThe safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,\u201d President Donald Trump said Wednesday at the White House. \u201cHopefully they will very quickly come up with the answer but until they do the planes are grounded.\u201d\nThe move is a major blow to Boeing, which has lost billions of dollars in value this week as nation after nation announced they were barring the aircraft from flying. The single-aisle Max family is the Chicago-based planemaker\u2019s largest seller and accounts for almost one-third of the company\u2019s operating profit.\nBoeing dropped as much as 3.2 percent after Trump\u2019s announcement but recovered much of the days loss by 3:17 p.m. in New York.\n- Advertisement -\nAffected planes will be grounded immediately upon reaching their destinations. The impact on travelers should be limited because there are only 67 Boeing 737 Max aircraft at three U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. and United Continental Holdings Inc.\nMore than 40 nations had announced the grounding of the jet \u2013 and in some cases a ban on flyovers of the plane \u2013 in recent days despite reassurances from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.\nThe FAA made its decision as a result of unspecified \u201cnew evidence collected at the site and analyzed today,\u201d the agency said in a tweet. It also reviewed satellite data it obtained earlier in the day.\n\u201cThe grounding will remain in effect pending further investigation, including examination of information from the aircraft\u2019s flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders,\u201d the agency said.\nThe Chicago-based manufacturer issued a statement saying it still has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the plane.\n\u201cWe are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,\u201d Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\u201d\nThe U.S. action followed Canada\u2019s decision to halt Max flights earlier Wednesday.\nCanada Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in Ottawa that satellites tracked the Ethiopian Airlines flight and suggest possible \u201csimilarities\u201d with a Lion Air crash on Oct 29. A Lion Air Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia, killing all 189 people aboard, following a malfunction of a software feature on the plane that repeatedly forced it into a dive.\nThe FAA and other aviation regulators around the world took several steps after the Indonesia crash to notify pilots of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, and to remind them how to overcome it in the event of a malfunction. However, a more formal fix to redesign it won\u2019t be mandated until April, the FAA said Monday.\nAll 157 people aboard the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 died when it plunged into the ground at high speed about six minutes after takeoff near Addis Ababa. Investigators have released no information about what caused the crash.\nTrump told reporters that he had spoken with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Acting FAA Administrator Daniel Elwell and Muilenburg before making the call to ground 737 Max 8 and Max 9 model planes in the U.S.\n\u201cAny plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo planes that are in the air will be grounded \u2014 if they are the 737 Max, will be grounded upon landing at the destination.\u201d\n\u201cOur hearts go out to all of those who lost loved ones, to their friends, to families, in both Ethiopian and Lion Airlines crashes that involved the 737 Max aircraft,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing. Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now, and hopefully they will very quickly come up with the answer but until they do the planes are grounded and you will be hearing from the FAA directly in a little while.\u201d\nSouthwest has 34 Max 8 aircraft among its more than 750 planes. In contrast, its fleet includes more than 500 of the older 737-700 model. The Dallas-based airline and United fly the Max across their route networks.\nA significant impact will be felt in Miami, where American has concentrated its initial Max deliveries for service to the Caribbean and to New York\u2019s LaGuardia airport. The carrier has 24 Max 8 jets in its fleet of more than 1,550 planes.\nThe last fleet-wide grounding by the FAA occurred on Jan. 17, 2013, when it ordered a halt to revenue flights by Boeing\u2019s then-new model, the mostly composite 787, after a lithium-ion batteries on the plane overheated. Prior to that, the last such action halting flights on a fleet occurred in 1979 on the Douglas DC-10.\nAlan Levin and Jennifer Epstein is a reporter for Bloomberg News.\n}}

{{(Corrects this of July 5 story to remove CHC ownership reference in paragraph three.)\nOSLO (Reuters) - The crash of an Airbus Super Puma helicopter that killed all 13 people aboard was the result of metal fatigue in its gearbox, Norway\u2019s Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) said in its final report on Thursday, confirming past findings.\nThe 2016 crash occurred after the Super Puma\u2019s main rotor blades separated from the helicopter as it was ferrying passengers from a Norwegian offshore oil platform operated by Equinor, then known as Statoil.\nThe flight was operated by Canada-based CHC Helicopter [CHCEL.UL].\n\u201cThe accident was a result of a fatigue fracture in a second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox,\u201d investigators reiterated on Thursday.\n\u201cCracks initiated from a micro-pit at the surface and developed subsurface to a catastrophic failure without being detected.\u201d\nInvestigators said they had excluded material unconformity and mechanical failure, as well as maintenance actions by the helicopter operator, as causes for the crash. Nor was there any connection between the crew handling and the accident, said the report.\nAmong the 12 recommendations they made, investigators said Airbus should take another look at the design of the main gearbox of the Super Puma.\n\u201cThe Accident Investigation Board Norway recommends that Airbus Helicopters revise the type design to improve the robustness, reliability and safety of the main gearbox in AS 332 L2 and EC 225 LP (helicopters).\u201d\nAirbus Helicopters said it welcomed the conclusion of the investigation and took note of the findings in the report.\n\u201cAirbus Helicopters is committed to the continuous improvement of the H225 MGB with the objective of increasing robustness, reliability and safety, as highlighted in the AIBN recommendation,\u201d said an Airbus spokesman.\n\u201cThis includes, among other initiatives, a roadmap for the development of new vibration monitoring methods which will be shared with industry in due course.\u201d\nThe Super Puma has come under intense media and regulatory scrutiny in Britain after a series of incidents linked to gearbox problems including a 2009 crash off Peterhead, Scotland, in which the rotor also flew off and 16 people died.\n}}

{{When four Sainsbury\u2019s executives met farmers from some of Africa\u2019s biggest tea-growing co-operatives in a hotel in Nairobi last month it should have been a mutual celebration of Fairtrade, the gold standard of ethical trading and the world\u2019s most trusted and best-known food certification scheme.\nBut instead of backslapping at the Pride hotel, the world\u2019s largest retailer of Fairtrade products precipitated the greatest crisis in the scheme\u2019s 25-year history by telling the 13 major tea groups and their 228,000 co-operative members that it intended to drop the globally known Fairtrade mark for their produce, and replace it with the phrase \u201cfairly traded\u201d.\nIn place of the strict rules devised by farmers\u2019 groups working with independent development experts to guarantee consumers that small-scale farmers are being rewarded with decent pay and bonuses, the \u00a323bn-a-year retailer said it planned to set up its own in-house certification scheme, set new ethical standards and introduce a different way to pay the groups.\nFrom next week the company will no longer label its Gold, Red and other bestselling own-brand teas as \u201cFairtrade\u201d but will call them \u201cfairly traded\u201d. Officially it is a pilot but the suspicion is that Sainsbury\u2019s will then roll out the new standard across other products including bananas and coffee.\nTo add to the woes of the Fairtrade brand, it was revealed last week that Tesco will move all its own-label coffee from Fairtrade to another ethical certification scheme, the Rainforest Alliance. According to the Grocer, an industry magazine, this is likely to happen in 2018 and follows a similar announcement by the retailer earlier this year that it will do the same with its own-brand tea.\nThe farmers at the meeting with Sainsbury\u2019s, mostly from Malawi, Rwanda and Kenya, were nonplussed. \u201cWhy change a system that has worked well for 25 years for both poor farmers and large supermarkets?\u201d asked one. Had not the supermarket reaped tens of millions of pounds\u2019 profit and huge moral kudos by pioneering Fairtrade and inviting customers to pay a bit more for their produce?\nAnd in return for meeting Fairtrade\u2019s high social, labour and environmental standards, the small farmers have also benefited to the tune of millions of pounds from the British consumer\u2019s sense of fair play. \u201cHas not everyone gained?\u201d the tea farmers asked.\nBut the Nairobi meeting was significant because Sainsbury\u2019s is just one of many large food and drink companies rethinking their supply chains, looking to cut costs and devising their own environmental and labour policies.\nBecause Sainsbury\u2019s is so important for Fairtrade, the company\u2019s move could be the beginning of the end of the scheme, and lead to lower social and labour standards, more hardship in developing countries and deep confusion among consumers, say some development and ethical trading groups.\n\u201cThis move by Sainsbury\u2019s represents a tip in the balance back to the powerful retailers,\u201d says Sophi Tranchell, managing director of Divine Chocolate, the highly successful ethical trading company part-owned by tens of thousands of cocoa farmers in Ghana.\n90% of the children at the Sukambizi Association Trust in Malawi attend primary school. Photograph: Chris Terry\/Fairtrade\nFairtrade took off as an idea in the 1980s as awareness grew in Europe that small farmers in developing countries were being ripped off by a grossly unfair global commodity trading system which perpetuated poverty and penalised the poorest. In 1992, a group of Britain\u2019s leading international charities, including Oxfam and the World Development Movement, picked up on a small Dutch initiative and set up the Fairtrade Foundation.\nTwenty-five years later, the certification scheme, which guarantees a minimum price to farmers as well as a financial bonus, has grown from the commercial margins to the retail mainstream. Fairtrade, worldwide, is now a $2bn-a-year global operation, backed by governments, charities, churches, the Women\u2019s Institute, A-list celebrities and supermarkets. In Britain, where it is most popular, nearly 80% of people are said to recognise its distinctive logo.\nIt has been an unlikely commercial success story, and a ray of optimism for millions of people concerned about inequalities between rich and poor countries and deteriorating human and labour rights.\n\u201cFairtrade is growing worldwide, especially in south-east Asia and eastern Europe. It now benefits 1.6 million farmers worldwide, has 1,240 Fairtrade-certified producer organisations in 75 countries and last year a record \u00a3150m was sent as social premium payments to producer groups,\u201d says Dar\u00edo Soto Abril, the Colombian chief executive of the International Fairtrade organisation.\n\u201cThe need to change a global food system that exploits both people and planet is greater now than ever,\u201d says Abril. \u201cThere are new challenges. Climate change is making life harder for smallholder farmers, there is child exploitation, and many workers in developing countries are paid well below even the extreme poverty level. Fairtrade is changing to take these new challenges into account.\u201d\nMeanwhile, ethical trading that covers non-food items from clothing to crafts has grown steadily in Europe and the US and is now thought to be worth billions more pounds a year. Following boycotts of companies by activists and public pressure a variety of certification schemes have sprung up, which retailers are invited to join, for a price.\nFor a while the corporates were happy to pay and have their supply chains independently audited, but in recent years some of the biggest have decided to go it alone. High street chains including Costa, Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, and producers such as Unilever, M&S and Mondelez\/Cadbury, have all devised their own schemes. But their standards vary enormously and consumers have to trust the companies.\nThe fractious Nairobi meeting made clear the despair felt by small farmers at the global trading system, in which supermarkets and shippers make big profits from importing raw produce from developing countries but barely anything goes to the farmers. It also showed how valuable a good ethical trading scheme can be for small farmers.\nAccording to people at the meeting, the more the Sainsbury\u2019s chiefs promised them contracts, advice and access to data, and told them the new in-house scheme would match their present income, the more worried they became.\nWomen in particular have been empowered by Fairtrade at the tea estate in Malawi. Photograph: Chris Terry\/Fairtrade\nTheir fears centred on the \u201csocial premium\u201d, the money that Fairtrade provides to farmers on top of the guaranteed minimum price they get for their produce. This money, which can be worth many thousands of pounds a year to big producer groups, goes straight to the farmers who agree to spend it on social schemes such as pensions, sick pay or education which they themselves choose and control.\nThe premium money, it emerged at the meeting, was in future going to have to be approved by a new Sainsbury\u2019s foundation. \u201cWe feel betrayed. We are expected to cross our fingers and hope that Mr Sainsbury helps us. The power to give you money or not depends on them. It is good if they are planning to really help us but not at the cost of disempowering us,\u201d said one man, who asked not to be named and who represents thousands of tea farmers. \u201cWe feel that our rights are being taken away from us, this feels like colonialism,\u201d said a second at the meeting. \u201cWe want to be partners and friends. You want to control me. I don\u2019t understand how a big retailer is chasing the premium going to poor people,\u201d said a third.\nSainsbury\u2019s apologised for giving the tea-growers such short notice of the changes it planned. But it has refused to consult further, and it is now feared that bananas, sugar, chocolate and dozens of other Fairtrade lines sold in the company\u2019s 2,100 stores will eventually be withdrawn from Fairtrade as the company rolls out its own ethical trading scheme.\nLast week Sainsbury\u2019s senior executives insisted the new scheme was a pilot that would build on Fairtrade standards. \u201cBy providing farmers with advice, skills, resources, funding and opportunities alongside accountability, as well as listening and learning from them, we believe we can help empower them to secure a better quality life for themselves, their workers, families and broader communities,\u201d said Judith Batchelar, director of brand at Sainsbury\u2019s.\nCompanies setting up their own ethical trading schemes all say they want to improve workers\u2019 conditions and pay. Some, such as Mondelez\/Cadbury which pulled out of the Fairtrade scheme last year, have promised to invest over $400m in their cocoa supply chain, but it has been suggested that others are choosing cut-price schemes which do not guarantee better terms or more money.\nDevelopment groups question their motives. \u201cWhy would a company like Sainsbury\u2019s that has been such a massive champion of Fairtrade decide to take the trusted mark off their tea products, and in the process take power and value away from small African producers who already have so little? At a time when sustainable development and human rights are going up the corporate agenda, it\u2019s hard to follow the company\u2019s reasoning,\u201d said Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam\u2019s ethical trade manager.\nConsumers, too, are confused. \u201cHow are we meant to know if these companies can be trusted? I only know the Fairtrade mark,\u201d said Gillian Hargreaves, a shopper at a Sainsbury\u2019s store in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week.\nSainsbury\u2019s insists that its new approach will benefit farmers. But it now faces consumer boycotts and is under heavy fire from African tea producers and international development and trading groups.\nA statement signed by Oxfam, Cafod, Christian Aid, the Women\u2019s Institute and several major ethical trading and co-operative groups together representing millions of consumers, urged it to rethink its plans.\n\u201cThe Fairtrade mark has become synonymous with ethical trade and quality for UK consumers. Sainsbury\u2019s new scheme risks undermining all that has been achieved over the last 25 years. The standards are unclear, and farmers and producers may no longer be able to decide themselves directly how the money raised is spent to help their communities,\u201d said the groups.\n\u201cThe fear is that if Sainsbury\u2019s launch their own \u2018ethical\u2019 line instead of using the Fairtrade model, other supermarkets might follow suit and consider ditching Fairtrade too,\u201d said Oxfam.\nBut conversations with the farmers and Sainsbury\u2019s suggest it has been planning to pull out of Fairtrade for two years \u2013 not only to improve farmers\u2019 conditions, but also for financial reasons. Sales of Fairtrade products are said to be slipping and the company feels it is not getting value for the \u00a360m which it says it has \u201cinvested\u201d in ethical trading since 1994.\nAlthough it sells nearly \u00a3200m of Fairtrade produce a year, overall company profits dropped 8% last year and in a fierce retail environment it now wants more credit for investing in poor farmers. It also suggests that it wants its money to be seen by the public to be better spent.\nThe soul singer Mica Paris, a Fairtrade ambassador, visiting tea producers in India. Photograph: Fairtrade\nSainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe is now on the defensive. \u201cWe most certainly don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers \u2013 far from it \u2013 and that\u2019s why this project is about testing and developing new approaches, collaborating with expert partners and listening to our farmers and producers \u2013 finding out what works, and what can be taken to scale and adopted to secure a sustainable supply chain that benefits both our suppliers and our customers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe principle of a company setting its own standards is fine, but the execution here is flawed,\u201d said Mike Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation in London. The group is funded by the licences it issues to companies and stands to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year from Sainsbury\u2019s withdrawal from tea \u2013 and far more if the retailer drops all its other lines.\n\u201cWe have always been supportive of companies who want to set up in-house schemes and create their own standards. Mondelez are adding to what we have done, putting $400m into cocoa. Others, like Sainsbury\u2019s, are substituting their own schemes and risk reversing the gains. Some independent schemes are good, but others are not.\n\u201cSainsbury\u2019s call it a pilot scheme, but it\u2019s over no defined period. Where is the detail? Who will administer it? Does it have enough staff? This is unacceptable and we must draw a line. The suspicion must be that they are trying to save costs. The question is why have they changed for what may be an inferior scheme?\u201d\nFairtrade is in real danger but it has come under fierce attack many times. Free-market thinktanks including the Institute of Economic Affairs, claim it is a barrier to free trade, which they say has led to many millions of people emerging from poverty. Academics have shown that it sometimes fails to improve the lives of very low-wage workers, and journalists have exposed how some companies and producer groups can abuse it.\nBut its biggest test is likely to be Brexit and the many new \u201cfree trade\u201d deals which Britain, the US and others are expected to sign. New taxes on imports from the world\u2019s poorest countries could cost small producers billions of dollars.\n\u201cToo often in the past, new trade deals have harmed not helped the poorest people. Leaving the EU\u2019s single market and customs area without putting in place measures similar to the ones which currently protect farmers in the poorest developing countries would punish millions of farmers,\u201d said Gidney.\nHe wants to keep talking with Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cWe are open to change. We want companies to own their supply chains and take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts they are having. There is no single route to a better trading system. We will survive this. We have to work together.\u201d\n}}

{{NAIROBI\/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board and raising questions about the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, a new model that also crashed in Indonesia in October.\nSunday\u2019s flight left Bole airport in Addis Ababa at 8:38 a.m. (0538 GMT), before losing contact with the control tower just a few minutes later at 8:44 a.m.\n\u201cThere are no survivors,\u201d the airline tweeted alongside a picture of Chief Executive Tewolde GebreMariam holding up a piece of debris inside a large crater at the crash site.\n\u201cThe pilot mentioned that he had difficulties and that he wanted to return,\u201d Tewolde told a news conference.\nPassengers from 33 countries were aboard, said Tewolde.\nThe dead included Kenyan, Ethiopian, American, Canadian, French, Chinese, Egyptian, Swedish, British, Dutch, Indian, Slovakian, Austrian, Swedish, Russian, Moroccan, Spanish, Polish, and Israeli citizens.\nAt least four worked for the United Nations, the airline said, and the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program director confirmed his organisation had lost staff in the accident.\nWeeping relatives begged for information at airports in Nairobi and Addis Ababa.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for my mum. We\u2019re just hoping she took a different flight or was delayed. She\u2019s not picking up her phone,\u201d said Wendy Otieno, clutching her phone and weeping.\nThe aircraft, a 737 MAX 8, is the same model that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct 29, killing all 189 people on board the Lion Air flight.\nThe cause of that crash is still under investigation.\nA senior U.S. government official said it was too early to tell if there was any direct connection between the two accidents, but that reviewing the issue would be among the top priorities for investigators.\nThe 737 is the world\u2019s best selling modern passenger aircraft and is seen as one of the industry\u2019s most reliable.\nA preliminary report into the October crash focused on airline maintenance and training and technical questions about the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor.\nBoeing is working on a software patch on the system, while insisting cockpit procedures were already in place to deal safely with problems the Lion Air crew experienced.\nEthiopian\u2019s new aircraft had no recorded technical problems and the pilot had an \u201cexcellent\u201d flying record, Tewolde said.\n\u201cWe received the airplane on November 15, 2018. It has flown more than 1,200 hours. It had flown from Johannesburg earlier this morning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUNSTABLE SPEED\u201d\nFlight ET 302, registration number ET-AVJ, crashed near the town of Bishoftu, 62 km (38 miles) southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, with 149 passengers and eight crew aboard, the airline said.\nThe flight had unstable vertical speed after take off, the flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted.\nData released by the Sweden-based service suggested the aircraft had climbed almost 1,000 feet after taking off from Addis Ababa, a hot and high-altitude airport whose thinner air requires extra effort from an aircraft\u2019s engines.\nIt dipped about 450 feet before rapidly climbing another 900 feet until the point where satellite tracking data was lost.\nThe aircraft had shattered into many pieces and was severely burnt, a Reuters reporter at the scene of the crash said. Clothing and personal effects were scattered widely over the field where the plane came down.\nThere was no immediate indication of what caused the crash and safety experts said it was too early to speculate, adding most accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors.\nA shoe of a passenger is seen at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET 302 plane crash, near the town of Bishoftu, southeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia March 10, 2019.

An urgent priority will be to find the two crash-protected cockpit recorders - one for data and the other for pilots\u2019 voice recordings.\nBoeing said it was sending a technical team to help with the Ethiopian-led investigation.\nANGUISHED RELATIVES\nAt Nairobi airport, many relatives were left waiting at the gate for hours, with no information from airport authorities. Some learned of the crash from journalists.\nRobert Mutanda, 46, was waiting for his brother-in-law, a Canadian citizen.\n\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t seen anyone from the airline or the airport,\u201d he told Reuters at 1pm, more than three hours after the flight was lost. \u201cNobody has told us anything, we are just standing here hoping for the best.\u201d\nKenyan officials did not arrive at the airport until 1:30 p.m.\nJames Macharia, the cabinet secretary for transport, said he heard about the crash via Twitter.\nNineteen staff from at least five U.N. and affiliated organisations died, including the World Food Program, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, the International Telecommunications Union, the U.N. Environment Program, the World Bank and the International Organisation on Migration, the IOM said.\nETHIOPIAN AIRLINES\nUnder international rules, responsibility for leading the crash investigation lies with Ethiopia but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also participate because the plane was designed and built in the United States.\nRepresentatives of Boeing and Cincinnati-based engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and General Electric Co and France\u2019s Safran SA, were expected to advise the NTSB.\nEthiopian is one of the biggest carriers on the continent by fleet size. The plane was among six of 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets the rapidly expanding carrier has ordered.\nSlideshow (17 Images)\nThe fleet will continue flying since the cause of the crash is not clear, the CEO said.\nIts last major crash was in January 2010, when a flight from Beirut went down shortly after take-off, killing all 90 people onboard. The Lebanese blamed pilot error, which was disputed by the airline.\nNorth American airlines that operate the 737 MAX 8 said they were monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines flies 31 MAX 8 jets while American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet. Southwest said it remained confident in the safety of its more than 750 Boeing jets.\n}}

{{As mourners and millions around the world attempt to make sense of the tragedy of the Germanwings plane crash, chilling new details have emerged.\nOn Monday, March 30, representatives for the airline and its parent company Lufthansa released a new statement about Germanwings Flight 9525, which crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday, March 24, failing to reach its destination of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany after leaving Barcelona, Spain.\nUnder a header reading \"Our deepest sympathies,\" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr and Thomas Winkelmann, spokesman for Germanwings' executive board, wrote a statement about the tragedy.\nPHOTOS: Stars Gone Too Soon\n\"The incomprehensible loss of 150 lives has filled us with the deepest sadness,\" it reads. \"We extend our sincere condolences to the families and friends of our passengers and colleagues. They are in our thoughts and prayers. We wish to thank the many thousands of helpers in France, Spain, Germany and numerous other countries around the world for their assistance and support. On behalf of all employees of the Lufthansa Group.\"\nThe official statement comes as further revelations about co-pilot Andreas Lubitz come to light. Authorities are looking into the late flyer's past, which, in conjunction with the information found on the plane's black box, is leading prosecutors to believe that Lubitz purposefully crashed into the Alps.\nAccording to CNN, Lubitz's medical records show a history of suicidal thoughts, but there was no direct evidence of such behavior in the time before the crash. Said suicidal incident was reportedly on Lubitz's record before he earned his pilot's license.\nPHOTOS: Stars We Lost in 2014\nFurther, the New York Times reports that Lubitz was facing vision problems. He allegedly had trouble with his eyesight, visiting a doctor who reportedly told him that the issue may have been the result of a psychological problem.\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{{news, local-news, police, crash\nA critical incident investigation is underway after a car collided with a truck in Fairfield on Thursday afternoon shortly after a police pursuit had been called off. Shortly before 3pm (November 8), a police vehicle attached to Liverpool Police Area Command attempted to stop a Mitsubishi sedan on Elizabeth Street at Liverpool. When the vehicle became stuck in traffic officers approached the vehicle, which sped away striking one officer\u2019s hand. The vehicle fled along North Liverpool Road. The Mitsubishi was eventually spotted by a Highway Patrol Vehicle from Fairfield and a short pursuit commenced at Fairfield West. The pursuit was terminated a short time later due to safety concerns. The POLAIR helicopter followed the vehicle as it approached the intersection of Smithfield Road and King Road. As the Mitsubishi entered the intersection, allegedly against a red traffic light, it was involved in a collision with a garbage truck. Police attended and arrested a 26-year-old man who was driving the Mitsubishi. The man was treated at the scene for possible head injuries and a laceration to the arm. He was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital in a serious condition where he remains under police guard. The truck driver was treated by Ambulance paramedics for possible fractures and conveyed to Liverpool Hospital in a stable condition. The injured police officer received treatment for an injury to her hand. A critical incident team will investigate all circumstances surrounding the incident. That investigation will be subject to independent review. Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed or has vision of the incident, to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\nhttps:\/\/nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net\/transform\/v1\/crop\/frm\/AVQnP83GTjMiJps7fBctPT\/2d0d32f5-6a94-4562-abc2-2826468f3157.jpg\/r3_0_1198_675_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\nCritical investigation underway following Fairfield West crash facebook SHARE\ntwitter TWEET\nemail\nwhatsapp\n}}

The United States and many other countries then grounded the Boeing 737 Max 8 as it had also been used in the Lion Air crash in October in Indonesia.\nSuspicions emerged that faulty sensors and software may have contributed to the two crashes in less than six months.\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration already has said satellite-based tracking data showed that the movements of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were similar to those of Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed off Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.\nThe planes in both crashes flew with erratic altitude changes that could indicate the pilots struggled to control the aircraft. Shortly after their takeoffs, both crews tried to return to the airports but crashed.\nEarlier Sunday, thousands in the capital of Addis Ababa mourned the country's victims in the crash, accompanying 17 empty caskets draped in the national flag through the streets of the capital. Some victims' relatives fainted and fell to the ground.\nThe service came one day after officials began delivering bags of earth to family members of the 157 victims of the crash instead of the remains of their loved ones because the identification process is expected to take such a long time.\nFamily members confirmed they were given a 1 kilogram (2.2 pound) sack of scorched earth taken from the crash site.

Deputies believe the victim, whose name has not been released, was crossing from the Somerset Apartments toward Kroger.A driver who witnessed the collision stopped to help. Nick Hammons called 911 and talked with the victim until first responders arrived.\"I could see the silhouette of somebody crossing the road in the distance,\" Hammons said over the phone. \"The left front light kind of went dark, and then all of a sudden I saw two legs up in the air and shoes coming off the legs. Then the person fell down onto the ground behind the car.\"Hammons said the car involved slowed down but drove off after Hammons pulled over.While on the phone with 911, Hammons can be heard several times trying to calm down the victim.\"Don't move. Don't move. I'm gonna help you. I know. Just relax. Alright? I know it hurts. It hurts a lot,\" he said. \"Your head is bleeding, OK? And we have some people on the way. They're gonna come get you, alright?\"Hammons has experience working patrol at a ski lift and said he has worked several bad ski accidents, so he knew he had to keep the victim still. He also quickly realized that they were in a vulnerable place.\"I actually wanna thank the guy who stopped behind me and directed traffic. It's only when you're kneeling over somebody in the middle of the road, who just got hit by a car, on a dark night, that you realize it's kind of a dumb spot to be,\" he said. \"So I'd like to thank him for getting his phone out, directing cars away from us.\"Deputies are piecing together statements from witnesses and video surveillance to track down the driver. At this time, investigators believe a man with short brown hair was driving a four-door sedan that is either white or light gray. They say there is likely significant damage to the front of the vehicle.Anyone with information that could help is asked to call the Warren County Sheriff's Department.\n}}

Two other Cuban women remain in hospital in a critical condition from burns and other related trauma. Their progress is being closely followed by many Cubans through regular hospital updates. The Boeing 737, leased by Mexican company Damojh to Cuba\u2019s flagship airliner Cubana, crashed shortly after takeoff on a domestic flight from Jose Mari Airport in Havana to the eastern city of Holguin. The plane crashed near a motorway and school campus in the agricultural neighbourhood of Boyeros close to the capital\u2019s airport.\nWitnesses saw a large fireball following a towering plume of smoke as emergency services rushed to the scene to extinguish the blaze. The tragedy has so far killed 100 Cubans, seven Mexicans, two Argentines and two Sahrawis from a disputed area in the Western Sahara known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Mexico\u2019s civil aviation authority has temporarily suspended Damojh\u2019s operations in a move it said was to ensure the firm adhered to regulations and allow it to gather information to help investigators find the cause of the crash. Damojh, which owned three Boeing 737s before the accident, has a chequered history having being suspended twice before during regulatory compliance reviews. Operations were halted for a month in 2010 after one if its planes was forced to make an emergency landing in the Mexican beach resort of Puerto Vallarta due to a problem with its landing gear.\nGETTY The Cuba plane crash on Friday was one of the country's worst air disasters\nAuthorities investigated it again in 2013 after receiving a complaint from Marco Aurelio Hernandez, who was identified by Mexican media at the weekend as a former Damojh pilot.

On Sunday, Cuban authorities retrieved one of the plane\u2019s black boxes in \u201cgood condition\u201d but are still looking for the flight data recorder. Cuba will lead the probe with the help of Mexican and US investigators.

{{national\nExperts hint at technical snag or visibility issues for crash; aircraft owners, aviation mishap investigators collect evidence from site\nThe police collecting evidence from the crash site. Pic\/Sayyed Sameer Abedi\nThe last recorded conversation between ATC Mumbai and the King C90 pilots that crashed in Ghatkopar on Thursday was 'We are breaking off, we will report to Juhu ATC'. The air space where the call was recorded was the spot for an official switchover from ATC Mumbai to ATC Juhu. ATC Juhu then tried to reach out to the pilots and when there was no reply, they waited for some time before alerting ATC Mumbai, who found the plane had gone off their radar. They quickly alerted all agencies concerned. Highly-placed officials attached to the ATC Juhu said, \"The last conversation was recorded when the aircraft was in the air approximate 10 miles [16km] away from Juhu Aerodrome and almost preparing for landing. Therefore, as routine practice, from Mumbai ATC, the pilot was being switched over to Juhu ATC at the technical point [where the accident happened].\"\nJuhu Aerodrome Director Ashok Kumar Verma confirmed the same and said, \"The charter plane took off as per the schedule and was in the air for nearly 47 minutes. It covered the air test route flying from Juhu airport and headed towards Surat airspace and after successfully completing the circuit was returning to Juhu aerodrome when it met with the accident.\"\nThe wreckage at the crash site. Pic\/Sameer Markande\nWhen asked if visibility was an issue at the time of take-off from Juhu Aerodrome, Verma replied in the negative, stating, \"Visibility was over 2,000 feet. We have allowed charters and helicopters to take off and land even at a visibility of 1,000 feet.\"\nWhen asked if the DGCA had issued any fresh guidelines post the accident on Thursday, the official replied in the negative.\nMeanwhile, Captain MRSK Vinod, a former Indian Air force pilot, who is the Chief of Flight Safety at UY Aviation (Pvt) Ltd, arrived in Mumbai on Thursday night and visited the crash site at Ghatkopar along with two members from the Aviation Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). They inspected the site and collected some material for investigation purposes.\nTechnical snag to blame?\nCaptain Vinod said, \"We have got the required evidence, and whatever was collected by the police and other rescue teams, including the black box, has already been handed over to the AAIB team. We have also taken photographs, videographs and have also recorded statements of witnesses.\" Aviation experts have hinted that the aircraft may have developed a sudden technical snag in its engine or as the plane was in Instrument Landing System (ILS) mode, which allows the aircraft to continue operations in low visibility, it might have developed an issue, due to which the pilot may have lost direction or both, which could have led to the accident. Charter planes fly at a height of 4,000 to 5,000 feet and there is no parachute on board for any emergency. Captain Vinod preferred not to comment on the reason for the accident, saying investigation was underway.\nWere pilots reluctant to fly?\nOn the allegation by family members of the deceased pilots that they were reluctant to fly the plane because of poor visibility, Captain Vinod said, \"We are professionals and must understand that a DGCA-Approved Maintenance Organisation has cleared the plane for testing, which is why the pilots agreed to fly. If they had refused, the testing would immediately have been aborted as per procedure.\" An officer at Ghatkopar police station said, \"We have cordoned off the area.

{{The ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed shortly after takeoff on Sunday was packed with humanitarian workers and international experts, many of whom were bound for a major United Nations environmental summit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.\nTwenty-two UN staff members were among the 157 people killed after Flight ET302 plummeted into a field outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed to CNN.\nThe airline said passengers from at least 35 countries were on the flight, often referred to as a \"UN shuttle\" for ferrying staff between Addis Ababa, home of the African Union headquarters, and Nairobi, the UN's headquarters in Africa.\nBut the plane was particularly full due to the UN Environment Assembly , which began on Monday. The summit, described as the world's highest-level decision-making body on the environment, brings together member states to tackle environmental challenges.\nUN officials paid their respects at the opening of the assembly. Executive director of UN Habitat Maimunah Mohd Sharif, who addressed the summit, said on Twitter : \"The @UN has lost many great & hardworking personnel. May they RIP.\"\nThe dead included at least 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight people from the United States, China and Italy, and seven from France and the United Kingdom, according to the airline. The victims' identities have not yet been officially confirmed.\nAmong those bound for the summit was British citizen Joanna Toole, who was due to represent the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), according to the director of her department, fisheries and aquaculture.\n\"So profoundly sad and lost for words,\" Manuel Barange said in a tweet . \"A wonderful human being, who loved her work with a passion.\"\nThe FAO, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Sudan, the World Bank and the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) each lost one staff member in the crash. The Office of the High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) lost two, as did the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Six staff from the UN Office in Nairobi (UNON) were killed, as were seven employees of the World Food Program (WFP).\nIrish national Michael \"Mick\" Ryan, global deputy chief engineer for the WFP, was among the dead. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar shared a tribute to Ryan on Twitter , saying: \"Michael was doing life-changing work in Africa with the World Food Programme. Deepest sympathies to family, colleagues & friends.\"\nRyan appeared in a video shared by WFP on Facebook last April, explaining his work in Kutupalong refugee camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, to create safe grounds for Rohingya refugees ahead of monsoon season.\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that two of its six nationals who died in the crash worked for the UN, including one Hong Kong resident.\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news and that the organization was working with Ethiopian authorities \"to establish the details of United Nations personnel who lost their lives in this tragedy.\"\nKenya had the largest share of victims, including Cedric Asiavugwa , a third-year law student at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, who was passionate about helping refugees and volunteered with the Red Cross in his free time.\nBorn and raised in Mombasa on the country's east coast, he was on his way home to Nairobi after the death of his fianc\u00e9e's mother, according to the university.\nAnother Kenyan aboard the flight was the former secretary general of Kenya's Football Federation, Hussein Swaleh, who was returning home after working as a match commissioner in an African Champions League game in Egypt, the Confederation of African Football said in a statement .\n\"Football has indeed lost a dedicated and hardworking individual that lived the game,\" the Football Kenya Federation tweeted on Sunday.\nFour of the nine Ethiopians killed in the crash were working for the Catholic Relief Services and were en route to training when the plane crashed. \"Although we are in mourning, we celebrate the lives of these colleagues and the selfless contributions they made to our mission, despite the risks and sacrifices that humanitarian work can often entail,\" CRS said in a statement.\nAnother Ethiopian, Tamirat Mulu Demessie, a child-protection specialist who worked with Save the Children, was confirmed dead by the nonprofit in a statement hailing his tireless efforts \"to ensure that vulnerable children are safe during humanitarian crises.\"\nPius Adesanmi, a renowned Nigerian-born scholar who was director of Carleton University's Institute of African Studies, was among the 18 victims from Canada, the Ottawa university confirmed. Adesanmi, who also held Canadian citizenship, was awarded the Penguin Prize for African writing in 2010 for his collection of essays in You're Not a Country, Africa!\n\"Pius Adesanmi was a towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship and his sudden loss is a tragedy,\" said Benoit-Antoine Bacon, president and vice-chancellor of the university.\nBefore Sunday's flight, Adesanmi posted a photo of himself on Facebook along with Psalm 139:9-10: \"If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.\"\n}}

{{A power shovel digs next to debris at the Ethiopia Airlines\u2019 crash site on Monday. Michael Tewelde\/AFP\/Getty Images\nThirty-two hours after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed on takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 aboard, shares of the plane\u2019s manufacturer, Boeing, traced a similar trajectory, dropping 12 percent at the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange and never fully recovering.\nWhile the cause of the Ethiopian incident hasn\u2019t yet been established, it makes sense that investors would lose confidence in Boeing: The crash came just five months after another involving a 737 Max in Indonesia, Lion Air Flight 610, and the dual disasters have spooked airlines and the traveling public. Erring on the side of caution, China and Indonesia have grounded the 737 Max, and 25 individual carriers have done so as well, including Ethiopian and Cayman Airways.*\nThe 737 Max first flew just two years ago, and some 350 are now in service. For such a new type of aircraft to suffer two fatal crashes is extraordinarily unusual, and bad. While the investigation into the Lion Air crash is still underway, a preliminary report suggests that the pilots failed to respond correctly after a faulty sensor led the autopilot to put the plane into a steep dive. We know even less about what happened to the Ethiopian flight. But no matter the causes, the mere fact that a single type of aircraft has had two accidents in swift succession raises questions about the trustworthiness of its manufacturer. Boeing has heretofore enjoyed a sterling reputation; its most recent all-new design, the 787, has never had a fatality, and the one before that, the 777, went 18 years without one. So it\u2019s worth asking: How did Boeing find itself suddenly in this reputational shitstorm?\nIt all comes down to business strategy. Chicago-based Boeing is locked in a fierce duopolistic rivalry with Toulouse, France\u2013based Airbus, with whom it roughly splits the $200 billion airliner market. The biggest segment of that market is for short- to medium-range narrow-body jets that typically carry between 100 and 200 passengers. These are the workhorses of aviation, unglamorous and hard-ridden, endlessly bouncing back and forth on routes like Salt Lake\u2013Denver and La Guardia\u2013O\u2019Hare.\nBoeing\u2019s entry, the 737, first flew in 1967, and though various improvements have been rolled out over the years, at heart it\u2019s still a creature of the Right Stuff era. Instead of computer-controlled fly-by-wire controls, which guide a plane\u2019s flight electronically, it still has old-fashioned mechanical actuators, and it\u2019s made of aluminum rather than modern lightweight composites.\nAirbus\u2019 A320 family, meanwhile, took to the skies a generation later, in 1987, but it was a fly-by-wire, composite creature from the get-go. In 2014, Airbus rolled out its most recent iteration, the A320neo, a range of jets with engines that were billed as being 15 percent more fuel efficient than the old model.\nTo maintain its lead, Boeing had to counter Airbus\u2019 move. It had two options: either clear off the drafting tables and start working on a clean-sheet design, or keep the legacy 737 and polish it. The former would cost a vast amount\u2014its last brand-new design, the 787, cost $32 billion to develop\u2014and it would require airlines to retrain flight crews and maintenance personnel.\nInstead, it took the second and more economical route and upgraded the previous iteration. Boeing swapped out the engines for new models, which, together with airframe tweaks, promised a 20 percent increase in fuel efficiency. In order to accommodate the engine\u2019s larger diameter, Boeing engineers had to move the point where the engine attaches to the wing.* This, in turn, affected the way the plane handled. Most alarmingly, it left the plane with a tendency to pitch up, which could result in a dangerous aerodynamic stall. To prevent this, Boeing added a new autopilot system that would pitch the nose down if it looked like it was getting too high. According to a preliminary report, it was this system that apparently led to the Lion Air crash.\nIf Boeing had designed a new plane from scratch, it wouldn\u2019t have had to resort to this kind of kludge. It could have designed the airframe for the engines so that the pitch-up tendency did not exist. As it was, its engineers used automation to paper over the aircraft\u2019s flaws. Automated systems can go a long way toward preventing the sorts of accidents that arise from human fecklessness or inattention, but they inherently add to a system\u2019s complexity. When they go wrong, they can act in ways that are surprising to an unprepared pilot. That can be dangerous, especially in high-stress, novel situations. Air France 447 was lost in 2009 after pilots overreacted to minor malfunctions and became confused about what to expect from the autopilot.\nIn the wake of crashes like last weekend\u2019s, there are always calls for improved training and awareness, and that undoubtedly helps. But it can only go so far. The human brain is fundamentally ill-equipped to work through unfamiliar problems when under high stress. Five years after AF 447, every Airbus pilot should have been hyperaware of how the pilots erred in that case, yet in 2014, the pilots of Air Asia 8501 did almost exactly the same thing, with the same result.\nDo I know this is what happened with the Ethiopian Air flight? No. But regardless of how the investigation into that crash pans out, the 737 Max will look snakebit. An obvious analogy is Malaysia Airlines, which the public viewed with misgivings after it lost two 777s in less than five months in 2014. Though it bore no obvious responsibility for either incident\u2014one was shot down by Russia; the second, MH370, is still a mystery, but as I argue in my book, the evidence indicates it was diverted by someone aboard the plane\u2014the airline suffered a steep drop in bookings and went into reorganization the following year.*\nBoeing isn\u2019t facing that kind of financial disaster. The company is too big and too important to global aviation to fail. But the future of the 737 Max is suddenly looking shaky. No one has to buy that particular model when there are others on the market. Boeing\u2019s either going to have to come up with a very convincing fix for whatever caused these two crashes, or think about starting over with a fresh sheet of paper.\nUpdate, March 12, 2019: After the FAA announced Monday that it would require \u201cdesign changes\u201d to the 737 Max, Boeing confirmed that it would update the plane\u2019s flight control software \u201cacross the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks.\u201d\nCorrection, March 12, 2019: An earlier version of this piece misstated that MH370 was hijacked, but there has been no official cause given for the disappearance of this flight. Correction, March 19, 2019: This piece originally misstated that in order to make room for the bigger engine in the 737 Max, Boeing engineers moved the point where the airplane attaches to the wing. They moved the point where the engine attaches to the wing.\nUpdate, March 12, 2019: The number of carriers that have grounded the 737 Max has increased since this article was published.\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n}}

{{SEATAC, Wash. \u2014 He cracked jokes, complimented the professional demeanor of an air traffic controller and apologized for making a fuss.\nBut the friendly tone of a 29-year-old airport worker who stole a commercial plane Friday night, performing acrobatic stunts before the fatal plunge into a thick island forest, belied his desperate actions.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to try to do a barrel roll, and if that goes good I\u2019ll go nose down and call it a night,\u201d Richard Russell said from the cockpit, according to a recording of his conversation with the controller.\nThe Pierce County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office confirmed Sunday that Russell had died in the fiery wreckage, but whether the crash was deliberate or accidental was one of several topics remaining for investigators.\nOthers include how, nearly 17 years after the 9\/11 attack, someone can simply take a passenger plane from a major U.S. airport without authorization.\nTragic as Russell\u2019s death was, he could have inflicted vastly more damage had he been so inclined.

It had been parked at a cargo and maintenance area for the night after arriving from Victoria, British Columbia, earlier in the day.\nRussell, a 3 1\/2-year Horizon employee, worked as a ground service agent. His responsibilities included towing and pushing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, de-icing them, and handling baggage.\nAuthorities said he used a tractor to rotate the plane 180 degrees, positioning it so that he could taxi toward a runway. They said it\u2019s not clear whether he had ever taken flight lessons or used flight simulators, or where he gained the skills to take off. The plane didn\u2019t require a key, but it did require buttons and switches to be activated in a particular order.\nHis 75-minute flight during the golden twilight took him south and west, toward the Olympic Mountains. As a flight controller tried to persuade him to land, he wondered aloud about whether he had enough fuel to make it to the Olympics, talked of the beautiful view, and said he had a lot of people who cared about him, apologizing for what he was doing.\nHe complimented the controller: \u201cYou are very calm, collect, poised,\u201d he said.\nHe said flying was a \u201cblast\u201d and that he didn\u2019t need much help: \u201cI\u2019ve played some video games before.\u201d\n\u201cYou think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot?\u201d he joked.\nHe also told the controller he \u201cwasn\u2019t really planning on landing\u201d the aircraft, and he described himself as \u201cjust a broken guy.\u201d\nAuthorities sent fighter jets to escort him, and the controller repeatedly tried to direct him to runways. But the plane slammed into tiny Ketron Island, a sparsely populated island southwest of Tacoma.\nRussell went by \u201cBeebo\u201d on social media. On his Facebook page, which had limited public access, he said he was from Wasilla, Alaska; lived in Sumner, Washington; and was married in 2012.\nIn a humorous YouTube video he posted last year, he talked about his job and included videos and photos of his travels.\n\u201cI lift a lot of bags. Like a lot of bags. So many bags,\u201d he said.\nRussell\u2019s family said in a statement that they were stunned and heartbroken.

{{Last Updated: May 5, 9:11 p.m.\nJohn Roderick, a 66-year-old retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, was flying an experimental, open-cockpit biplane back from the Flagler County Airport to St. Augustine this afternoon, according to a state trooper, when his manual and electrical fuel pumps both failed over western Flagler at 2:30 p.m.\nRodderick, of Ponte Verda, tried to maneuver his plane toward an empty field along State Road 100.

There was a fuel leak. It was stopped. Fuel remains in the plane\u2019s tanks, though the plane was never on fire.\nThe plane was built in 1969, according to its Federal Aviation Administration registration, by Alfred Pfouts.

{{After days of resistance, the United States on Wednesday followed its counterparts around the world in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8, the aircraft involved in a deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday and another several months ago in Indonesia.\nFederal Aviation Administration officials said that airplane tracking data they viewed Wednesday and new evidence from the wreckage of the crash in Ethiopia showed similarities to the crash in Indonesia, leading the agency to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9, another aircraft in the series.\nPresident Donald Trump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air.\nAs recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly.\n\"Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice,\" Trump said at an afternoon news conference. \"The safety of the American people, and all people, is our paramount concern.\"\nBut there were growing questions about the slow response to the crisis and whether the nation's top air-safety officials acted quickly enough to protect the flying public. Trump took the unusual step of consulting personally with Boeing's chief executive earlier this week.\nIn the months leading up to the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, U.S. pilots had expressed exasperation about the aircraft's systems, which they said limited their control of the planes, according to a confidential safety reporting system hosted by NASA.\nPilots complained of inadequate training on automation-assisted flying systems, unfamiliarity with the controls, anxiety that prompted them to engage autopilot earlier than normal, and at least two instances where the plane pitched downward or maneuvered against pilots' inputs. Some of the pilot complaints were first reported by the Dallas Morning News.\nThe FAA denied that the pilots' complaints were indicative of problems with the automation system that has been cited as a factor in the Indonesia crash, but some pilots specifically noted that system as a possible cause of flight-control problems in their reports to NASA.\nTrump's announcement came hours after one by Canada's transportation minister grounding the jets. Canada had been the last major holdout besides the United States. China was the first major power to ground the planes, followed by countries around the world. On Tuesday, the European Union and several others did the same. Chinese officials said they acted after the FAA failed to do so.\nThe FAA's emergency order Wednesday states that the similarities in the Ethiopia and Indonesia tragedies \"warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.\"\nA McLean, Virginia-based aerospace firm, Aireon, used its plane-tracking technology to help investigators get a clearer idea of the way the Ethiopian Airlines plane was moving and how that compared to the Oct. 29 Lion Air flight, acting FAA administrator Daniel Elwell said.\nAn initial batch of raw data was essentially too fuzzy to be helpful, and the FAA lacked the ability to refine it into usable form on its own, Elwell said.\nBut Aireon, with help from Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board, were able to \"refine the initial return of the satellites to create a description of the flight,\" Elwell said. \"The track of the Ethiopian Airlines flight was very close - and behaved very similarly - to the Lion Air flight.\"\nAviation experts said the two planes headed up and down multiple times after takeoff. A preliminary report by Indonesian authorities found that a faulty sensor prompted an automation feature on the plane to repeatedly force the plane to descend, until it crashed and killed all on board.\nThe investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash. Elwell said that \"we still have a lot to learn before we can say they were the same cause and effect.\"\nElwell also said important \"physical evidence\" was pulled from the wreckage linking the two flights, though he said he could not describe it because the United States is a party to the active investigation.\nYet that evidence \"helped us have more fidelity on the flight track, what was happening during the flight, and that evidence aligns the Ethiopian flight closer to what we know happened in Lion Air,\" Elwell said. \"That's about all I can say.\"\nThe order will ground more than 70 aircraft. In the United States, the aircraft is used by American and Southwest airlines, which combined have 58 Max 8s in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the Max 9 planes.\nBoeing said that it continues to have full confidence in the safety of the Max 8 and Max 9 but that after consulting with the FAA, the NTSB, aviation authorities and its customers, it decided to suspend operations of its global fleet of more than 370 Max aircraft.\n\"Boeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft,\" the company said in a statement, adding that it supported the FAA's decision.\n\"We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again,\" the company said.\nOfficials at American Airlines - which, along with a union representing its pilots, had reiterated its belief that the planes were safe to fly - said they were now being grounded out of \"an abundance of caution.\"\n\"Our teams will be working to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience,\" the airline said.\nSouthwest said it was \"immediately complying\" with the FAA order, noting that it operates a fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s and that the 34 Max 8s in its fleet \"account for less than five percent of our daily flights.\"\n\"While we remain confident in the MAX 8 after completing more than 88,000 flight hours accrued over 41,000 flights, we support the actions of the FAA and other regulatory agencies and governments across the globe that have asked for further review of the data - including information from the flight data recorder - related to the recent accident involving the MAX 8,\" Southwest said.\nCanadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he issued a \"safety notice\" grounding the flights Wednesday after newly available satellite data was reviewed.\n}}

It crashed shortly afterwards.\nAs the crash investigation got underway, the Civil Aviation Administration of China ordered Monday that all domestic Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets be out of the air by 6 p.m. local time, due to its principle of \"zero tolerance for safety hazards.\"\nChina has one of the world's largest fleets of Boeing 737 MAX 8, operating 97 of the planes, according to Chinese state-run media.\nThe move was followed by an announcement from Ethiopian Airlines that the carrier had grounded its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets as an \"extra safety precaution.\" Cayman Airways also said on Monday it was grounding both of its \"new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft ... until more information is received.\"\nSunday marked the second time in less than six months that a new Boeing aircraft crashed just minutes into a flight. A Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight went down over the Java Sea last October, killing all 189 people on board.\nBoth crashes are under investigation and there is no evidence of a link between the two, but similarities in the incidents have prompted caution among some airlines.\n\"Given in both air crashes, the aircrafts were newly delivered Boeing 737 MAX 8, and both accidents occurred during the take-off, they share certain similarities,\" the Chinese administration said in a statement. It added that it would contact Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration to confirm \"flight safety\" issues before allowing the planes to fly again.\nMary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and the former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, called the two incidents \"highly suspicious.\"\n\"Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year.

{{In this Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, file photo, members of the National Transportation Safety Committee lift a box containing the flight data recorder from a crashed Lion Air jet onboard a rescue ship anchored in the waters of Tanjung Karawang, Indonesia. Lion Air pilots struggled to maintain control of their Boeing jet as an automatic safety system in the aircraft repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to a draft of a preliminary report by Indonesian officials who are looking into the deadly crash.\nFaulty equipment and Indonesian carrier Lion Air's own safety failures had pilots fighting for control of their Boeing 737 MAX 8 as it plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 28, killing all 189 people aboard, investigators said Wednesday.\nBriefing reporters on the aircraft's black box data, the investigators said they were still struggling to understand why the plane crashed but they cited multiple factors centered on faulty sensors and an automatic safety system that repeatedly forced the plane's nose down despite the pilots' efforts to correct the problem.\nThe pilots simply may have been overwhelmed, said one of the crash investigators, Ony Suryo Wibowo.\n\"The problem is if multiple malfunctions occur all at once, which one should be prioritized?\" Wibowo said.\nAircraft Carrying 189 People Crashes in Indonesia\nThe brand-new Lion Air jet that crashed shortly after taking off from Jakarta is a Boeing 737 that went into service three months ago. (Published Monday, Oct. 29, 2018)\nThe lack of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder, which is still missing, is a dire obstacle to resolving that mystery, the investigators said.\nThe report by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Commission repeats earlier recommendations made just after the disaster that pilots be better versed in emergency procedures and aware of past aircraft problems.\nShortly after the catastrophe, Lion Air issued a notice to pilots urging them to be more proactive in reporting problems.\nNurcahyo Utomo, an investigator for Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Commission, told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday that four of the crashed aircraft's previous flights had experienced technical problems, with two showing no such difficulties.\nHe said investigators were trying to understand what maintenance workers had done to try to fix the problems and if there were other steps that should have been taken.\nThe MAX aircraft that crashed is the latest version of Boeing's popular 737 jetliner. Its new automated system pushes the nose down if a sensor detects that the nose is pointed so high that the plane could go into an aerodynamic stall.\nThe sensor, called an angle-of-attack vane, or AOA, malfunctioned in earlier flights.\nPilots who flew the aircraft from Bali to Jakarta a day before the crash told investigators that the anti-stall system engaged due to erroneous airspeed and altitude indicators, but the flight crew managed to adjust the plane's pitch manually by shutting the automated system off. That enabled them to restore control and land safely.\nUtomo said it was unclear why the pilots on the flight from Jakarta to a regional airport the next day were unable to do the same.\n\"Even if the pilot did not have time to meet with the engineer, he should be able to know what the problems experienced by the aircraft before,\" he said.\n\"We need to find out what happened and why the pilots took different actions. That why we really want to have the cockpit voice recorder.\"\nIn a statement following the release of the report, Boeing played up the possibility of pilot error.\n\"As our customers and their passengers continue to fly the 737 MAX to hundreds of destinations around the world every day, they have our assurance that the 737 MAX is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies,\" it said.\nThe aircraft manufacturer noted that the investigators' report cited actions by the flight crew that led to the crash. It also pointed to maintenance work and procedures that had failed to fix the aircraft's repeated problems.\nPeter Lemme, an expert in aviation and satellite communications and a former Boeing engineer who wrote an analysis of the data on his blog, likened the problems to \"a deadly game of tag\" in which the plane pointed down, the pilots countered by manually aiming the nose higher, only for the sequence to repeat about five seconds later.\nThat happened 26 times during the 11-minute flight, but pilots failed to recognize what was happening and follow the known procedure for countering incorrect activation of the automated safety system, Lemme told The Associated Press.\nLemme said he was troubled that there weren't easy checks to see if sensor information was correct, that the crew of the fatal flight apparently wasn't warned about the problems on previous flights and that the Lion Air jet wasn't fully repaired after those flights.\n\"Had they fixed the airplane, we would not have had the accident,\" he said. \"Every accident is a combination of events, so there is disappointment all around here,\" he said.\nThe Indonesian investigation is continuing with help from U.S. regulators and Boeing.\nMore than 200 MAX jets have been delivered to airlines around the world. Pilots at American Airlines and Southwest Airlines complained this month that they had not been given all information about the new automated anti-stall safety system on the MAX.\nCopyright Associated Press\n}}

{{Right from the start of last month\u2019s fatal flight of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet from Indonesia, pilots were struggling with an automatic flight control system that had caused problems during a flight the day before, according to a preliminary investigative report.\nThe report \u2014 based on an analysis of readings from the jet\u2019s flight data recorder, or \u201cblack box\u201d \u2014 says the pilots on the Oct. 29 flight fought for 10 minutes to keep the Boeing jet\u2019s nose from being pushed downward. But they lost the struggle against the automatic system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS. The 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people aboard.\nBoeing had added the MCAS capability to the 737 MAX as a safeguard to keep the plane from stalling under extreme aerodynamic conditions. Investigators say the system on the Lion Air jet apparently was responding to spurious information from angle-of-attack sensors that measure the air flow over the wings.\nRead the preliminary report: Indonesian investigators trace what went wrong on Lion Air Flight 610\nThe pilots repeatedly used manual controls to push up the jet\u2019s nose, and the automatic system repeatedly sent commands to push it back down, according to the report. \u201cIn our view, the plane was not airworthy,\u201d Reuters quoted Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator for Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee, as saying at a news conference in Jakarta on Wednesday (Tuesday night PT).\nBoeing says the remedy for the angle-of-attack sensor problem is to switch off the automatic anti-stall system, but the Lion Air pilots didn\u2019t take that step.\nOne of the sensors had been replaced two days before the crash, on Oct. 27, but the system acted up nevertheless during an Oct. 28 flight, the report says. During that trip, the plane\u2019s flight crew experienced similar problems with the anti-stall system and switched it off, as recommended. After landing, the pilot made note of the issues. Maintenance workers conducted some corrective procedures and reported that the issues were resolved.\nThe report raises a number of questions about the anti-stall system, and about Lion Air\u2019s maintenance procedures in the days before the crash. Investigators called on Lion Air to improve its \u201csafety culture\u201d and to tell its pilots to discontinue flights as soon as possible if they encounter conditions that aren\u2019t airworthy.\nAnother question has to do with the pilots\u2019 state of mind on the final flight: Why didn\u2019t they switch off the automatic control system, as the previous day\u2019s crew had done? Further clues for answering that last question might have been contained on the 737\u2019s cockpit voice recorder, but that black box has not been recovered.\nThere\u2019s been a debate about how much pilots are expected to know about the automatic control system and what to do if it malfunctions. Boeing says the procedure is covered in flight operations manuals for the 737, but some pilots have said they didn\u2019t hear about the MCAS or about the potential control issue until after the Lion Air crash.\nAfter the report\u2019s release, Boeing issued a statement saying that the company was \u201cdeeply saddened by the loss of Lion Air Flight 610.\u201d It expressed condolences to those whose loved ones were lost in the crash.\n\u201cSafety is a core value for everyone at Boeing, and the safety of our airplanes, our customers\u2019 passengers and their crews is always our top priority,\u201d Boeing said in its statement. \u201cAs our customers and their passengers continue to fly the 737 MAX to hundreds of destinations around the world every day, they have our assurance that the 737 MAX is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies.\u201d\nBoeing said it was \u201ctaking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this accident, working closely with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as technical advisers to support the [Indonesian] NTSC as the investigation continues.\u201d\nThis is an updated version of a report originally published at 3:01 p.m. PT Nov. 27.\n}}

{{The second of two 14-year-old bicyclists hit by a New Orleans cabdriver last week (July 24) has been hospitalized with bleeding in his brain, the boy's mother said.\nMetairie resident Jeanette Estenzo said she took her son, Josiah Dillon, back to the hospital Thursday after the teen complained of persistent headaches that left him incapable of venturing outdoors for any length of time.\n\"We didn't realize how serious it was,\" she said by phone Friday from beside her son's bed at Tulane Lakeside Hospital in Metairie. \"Every day the headaches kept up. They never went outside. He wouldn't go outside because his head would throb and he'd get light headed.\"\nDillon and his friend Kyran Reid were on their bicycles around 12:15 p.m. on July 24 when cabdriver Shukhrat Kurbanov ran a stop sign at the intersection of Danny Park and 27th Street and struck both teens, Jefferson Parish authorities said.\nKurbanov, 28, a driver for New Orleans-based American Taxi, got out of his taxi to ask if the teens were OK and then gave each $50 for the damage to their bicycles before driving away, authorities said. He was cited with negligent injuring, disregarding a stop sign and failure to report a crash - but not arrested for hit-and-run.\n\"I'm very pissed,\" said Estenzo, 42. \"How can you rely on 14 year olds who are in shock? There's no way you leave two kids on the side of the road.

Col. John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, said Thursday that Kurbanov was not charged with hit-and-run because he stopped after the accident.\n\"Since he did stop to render aid, that would not classify it as a hit-and-run,\" he said. \"He stopped to make sure the kids were all right, but he did not report the accident.\"\nEstenzo called the citations a \"slap on the wrist.\"\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"I'm dumbfounded.

As for Dillon, he was initially checked out by doctors the day of the crash. But a subsequent CT scan administered Thursday revealed a ruptured blood vessel in his brain, his mother said. The bleeding in his brain has neither worsened nor improved, Estenzo said, and he is expected to spend at least one more night in a hospital bed.\n\"He's crushed,\" she said of her son's spirits. \"He broke down in tears when the doctor told him he couldn't play football.

{{JAKARTA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Indonesian divers on Friday resumed a search for a second black box amid the sunken wreckage of a nearly new aircraft that slammed into the sea off Jakarta this week, killing all 189 people on board.\nSearchers have found only part of one black box and just one passenger has been identified from partial remains after air traffic control lost contact with the plane 13 minutes after it took off on Monday from the capital.\nEfforts are now focused on retrieving the second of the two black boxes, as the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are known, the head of Indonesia\u2019s transport safety panel said.\n\u201cThe team have been hearing the \u2018ping\u2019 sound from another black box since two days ago,\u201d Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters.\nThe seafloor is just 30 m (98 ft) down, but strong currents and nearby energy pipelines have hampered the search for the aircraft operated by budget carrier Lion Air, which was heading for the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang when it crashed.\nWhile victims\u2019 relatives are desperate to know what happened, the investigation of the first crash of a Boeing Co 737 MAX, which only went into service in August, is also the focus of scrutiny by the global aviation industry.\nNavy divers on Thursday pulled from the muddy seabed the \u201ccrash-survivable memory unit\u201d of one black box, raising hopes its stored data will show what went wrong on flight JT610, whose pilot had received permission to turn back before the crash.\nBut the damage suffered by the device reflected the severity of the impact, said investigators, adding that they did not yet know which of the black boxes, housed at opposite ends of the plane, it came from.\nIndonesia\u2019s transport safety panel pledged to move as quickly as possible to download the data, which can take as little as two hours, although analysing it might require several weeks.\nResults of a preliminary investigation will be made public after 30 days, one panel official said.\nIndonesia is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation markets. Its transport safety panel investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.\n}}

{{Last week's episode of Lost, \"Meet Kevin Johnson,\" gave us even more information about the wreck of Oceanic Flight 815 (even if it was the last hour of geek power before a brief hiatus\u2014sniff, sniff). Just as the recently returned Michael was ready to put No. 2 Other Mr. Friendly's claim that the island wouldn't let him die to the ultimate test, some breaking television news stopped him in his tracks: The wreckage of the castaways' flight had been found at a \"tremendous depth,\" with \"little chance of recovering remains or a black box.\" After Hollywood Sci-Fi vs. Reality got expert insight into how black boxes work from James Cash, chief of the vehicle recorders division at the National Transportation Safety Board, we were a little skeptical about these untraceable remains of what would turn out to be a fake plane.\nCash says that there are probably some places in the ocean where recovery isn't feasible because the sea floor is too deep or too rugged. In this season's second episode of Lost, \"Confirmed Dead,\" we learned from another newscast that Flight 815's wreckage was discovered in the Sunda Trench off the coast of Bali. The Sunda Trench, which is also called the Java Trench, is about 24,000 ft. below sea level, making it the third deepest point on the planet (well behind the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean, which is more than 36,000 ft. down). At these depths, it's believable that nothing from the wreckage could be salvaged.\nThe deepest aircraft recovery Cash remembered was from South African Airways Flight 295, which crashed over the Indian Ocean off the coast of Mauritius on Nov. 28, 1987. That site was about 12,000 ft. deep, and it took salvagers six months to coordinate the recovery of the CVR (cockpit voice recorder); the FDR (flight data recorder) was never found. Whether it's supreme Other Ben or Charles Widmore (or a secret Ben\/Widmore team?) who staged the crash and damned the castaways to purgatory, we have to give one bad guy some credit: He did his homework and planted the fake in a spot that may very well be deep enough to prevent recovery efforts. \u2014Erin Scottberg\n}}

{{PETALING JAYA (The Star\/Asia News Network) - Families of passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370 have offered their help to counsel to the families of those who were killed in another MAS flight, MH17, which was shot down over the Ukraine on July 17.\n\"No one deserves to go through what they're going through. They are like we were in the beginning: quiet and wanting their space. But we are here for them, we actually know what they're going through, we know this is so painful, so hard,\" Ms Jacquita Gonzalez, wife of MH370 in-flight supervisor Patrick Francis Gomez, told The Guardian.\nMs Gonzalez, who married Gomez at 22, 10 years after meeting him when she was 12, added that in the case of MH17, there would be some closure for the families of those on board MH17.\n\"I'm glad that MH17 is being settled and at least they have the remains coming back, they know where the plane is - now it's about who's at fault and who did that,\" said Ms Gonzalez.\nShe added that there was still no closure for those presumed killed when MH370 went missing in March.\n\"But we are still in limbo, we don't know anything because we haven't heard anything about MH370... We also want closure, we want to know what happened.\"\nMH370, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, left the KL International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 and disappeared from radar screens about an hour later, while over the South China Sea. It was to have arrived in Beijing at 6.30am on the same day.\nA multinational search was mounted for the aircraft, first in the South China Sea and then, after it was learned that the plane had veered off course, along two corridors - the northern corridor stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand and the southern corridor, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak then announced on March 24 - 17 days after the disappearance of the aircraft - that Flight MH370 \"ended in the southern Indian Ocean\".\nIt was reported that the remains of those killed on MH17 are not expected to return for many more weeks, as Dutch specialists are currently using the DNA of next-of-kin to identify the remains retrieved from sites 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border, near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.\nMH17, a Boeing 777-200ER airliner was shot down on while on a scheduled flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The crash, which killed all 298 on board, is believed to have been caused by a Buk surface-to-air missile.\nOn the return of the remains, Mr Murphy Govind, the brother of MH17 stewardess Angeline Premila Rajandran, said: \"It is sad that the bodies will not be home before Hari Raya but there's nothing we can do. We can just hope for the best. As long as the Dutch people are doing their job identifying the bodies, we just hope that they can do it as soon as possible.\"\n}}

{{KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A deadly plane crash at Nepal\u2019s international airport was the fault of the pilot, who had been \u201cextremely upset\u201d and chain-smoked and wept in the cockpit during the flight, an investigation report said.\nThe US-Bangla Airlines flight from Dhaka to the Nepali capital in March crashed on landing in Kathmandu and caught fire, killing 51 of the 71 people on board, in the Himalayan nation\u2019s worst aviation disaster for 26 years.\nParts of a draft report by a Nepali government-appointed panel, seen by Reuters on Monday, said the captain, Abid Sultan, had been \u201cextremely upset and hurt\u201d by a female colleague who raised questions about his reputation as an instructor in the airline.\n\u201cHe was very much under stress due to this particular issue,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cThis mistrust and stress led him to continuously smoke in the cockpit and also suffer an emotional breakdown several times during the flight,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThe captain was \u2018crying and sneezing\u2019 on several occasions during the flight,\u201d the draft said, citing recorded conversation between the cockpit and air traffic controllers.\nThe first officer was constantly trying to console him, it added.\nThe captain, a former Bangladesh air force pilot, failed to follow instructions from air traffic controllers to land from a southern approach and took a more difficult northern approach to the single runway. He was unable to align the plane before landing, the report said.\nThe plane skidded off the runway onto the grass around it. The captain was among those killed.\nReuters was not able to see the complete report. An official of the investigation commission said the draft had been \u201cillegally leaked\u201d and that the final report would take some time to be published.\nUS-Bangla Airlines CEO Imran Asif said in Dhaka: \u201cThe official report has not been published or released. I don\u2019t know what evidence they are talking about.\u201d\nLanding at Kathmandu airport, which is surrounded by hills, is considered difficult.\nIn 1992 all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane were killed when it ploughed into a hill as it tried to land.\n}}

{{On September 5, a U.S. Air Force aircraft crashed at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), killing the pilot. But even a week later, the Air Force has refused to reveal the type of aircraft involved in the incident. The hush-hush treatment has left many people wondering what the plane could be, and whether the Air Force is developing a new \"black\" aircraft that has not been declassified to the public.\nHowever, sources tell Aviation Week that the pilot involved in the crash, Lt. Col. Eric Schultz, was a squadron commander of an Air Force unit that tests and evaluates foreign aircraft. If this is the case, the most likely explanation is that Schultz was piloting a foreign jet at the time of the crash.\nAirmen who flight test foreign military planes, sometimes called Red Hats, are part of an unnumbered unit within Detachment 3 of the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, stationed out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. A press release from Nellis indicates that the aircraft involved in the incident belonged to Air Force Material Command, which oversees Detachment 3 of the 53rd. Flight testing foreign jets was previously conducted by the 413th Flight Test Squadron and the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron before that.\nThese units have been known to operate a variety of Russian-built fighter aircraft, including the MiG-29 and several jets built by Russian aviation contractor Sukhoi. The Su-27 air superiority fighter, for example, was spotted flying over the Nevada Test and Training Range this past January.\nThe exact aircraft type involved in the crash is still unknown, though it could be an Su-27 or possibly even the newer Su-30 multirole fighter, which Russia has sold to multiple U.S. allies such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Evaluating Russian aircraft has become a priority for the U.S. Air Force these days, as aerial encounters between the two militaries over Syria and the Baltics have become more common.\nThe mystery of the crash is compounded by the fact that Schultz was an experienced test pilot and engineer. A holder of six degrees, including a doctorate in aerospace engineering, Schultz had flown combat missions in the F-15E in Afghanistan and early flight test evaluations in the F-35, racking up more than 2,000 hours in a variety of aircraft over his career.\nSource: Aviation Week\n}}

{{Investigators are some way from knowing what caused the aircraft to crash. (Cantonal Police Graub\u00fcnden)\nThe 20 victims of the recent vintage Juncker Ju-52 aircraft crash can be buried having been formally identified by the authorities. Investigators say it will take \u201cseveral weeks or months\u201d before they can establish what caused the tragedy.\nOne of Switzerland\u2019s worst air traffic accidents took place on August 4 when the aircraft crashed at altitude into the Piz Signas mountain in eastern Switzerland. All 17 passengers and three crew members were killed.\nEarly indications suggest there was no collision with another aircraft or wires and no suggestion of foul play. There also appears to have been no distress call from the pilot before the plane crashed. On Friday, the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board said it was too early to give any more details.\nThe crashed plane was a Junker Ju-52 (affectionately known as 'Tante Ju' or 'Auntie Ju' in German), owned and operated by the JU-Air company based in D\u00fcbendorf, which specialises in sightseeing flights using old military planes. The craft was constructed in 1939, and before Saturday had flown for 10,187 hours.\nJU-Air has been operating sightseeing tours with three Ju-52s since 1983. The company has said it would resume sightseeing flights of its historic aircraft fleet on August 17.\nswissinfo.ch\/mga\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n}}

She stayed in her SUV and called her family for help.\nThey were en route to help her, when a man driving a black pickup truck came off WB I-70 and struck her on the driver's side. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Officials identified the victim as Laura Moreno Bravo.\nIndiana State Police say it\u2019s not clear what caused the 69-year-old pickup driver to crash into the victim\u2019s parked car, but story is important safety message for drivers everywhere.\n\"She had a flat tire and she pulled over. She was sitting inside her car. Her car was struck by a truck traveling at highway speeds and she was killed instantly,\" said Indiana State Police Sgt. John Perrine.\nFor years, Sgt. Perrine has preached highway safety, in some cases after state troopers have had their cars hit.\nWhile Indiana law requires drivers to move over or slow down when they see emergency crews working on the interstate, the law does not apply to all drivers.\nStill, state police say deadly crashes like the one that killed Moreno Bravo are always avoidable.\n\"It\u2019s simply a courtesy thing. If you see someone broken down on the highway, you should treat them like an emergency vehicle. You should move over for them,\" said Perrine.\nIf drivers do have car trouble, Perrine says they need to understand their options. Sometimes it's best to stay inside the vehicle, like Moreno Bravo did.\nYou can also call 911 to get police to respond to the scene- potentially making it safer. Other times it's safest to pull over at the next exit.\nThere is no one solution to stay safe.\n\"The key to safety on the highway is you should never feel safe or comfortable,\" said Perrine.\nThe driver of the truck was taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. It\u2019ll be up to prosecutors to decide if any criminal charges will be filed.\nThe crash caused backups and delays for hours; it was cleared around 9 a.m.\nThe driver of the truck was required to submit a test for intoxication. The results of that test are pending.\n}}

{{This content was published on September 2, 2018 8:00 AM\nA relative of one of the 229 victims of Swissair flight 111 is comforted by a member of Swissair staff at Geneva Airport on September 3, 1998\n(swissinfo.ch\/Keystone)\nOn September 2, 1998, 229 people died when Swissair flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia. Twenty years on, swissinfo.ch looks back at the worst accident in Swiss civil aviation history and the consequences both for airline safety and for Swissair.\nTwo million pieces of debris; 275 kilometres (171 miles) of electrical wiring; 229 victims from 44 countries. The statistics are still shocking. This clip from Swiss television the following day shows an understandably emotional Philippe Bruggisser, the former head of Swissair\u2019s parent company SAirGroup, updating the media:\nThe MD-11 aircraft took off from New York at 8:18pm local time, heading for Geneva. Just under an hour later, the pilot and co-pilot detected smoke in the cockpit coming through the air-conditioning system. They requested permission to land and were redirected to the airport at Halifax in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, just over 100 kilometres away.\nNot realising the gravity of the situation, the pilots took a detour to dump some fuel to reduce their weight for landing, but gradually the plane\u2019s instruments \u2013 including autopilot, flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder \u2013 failed, and flying the plane manually became impossible as smoke filled the cockpit. Communication with Halifax ended six minutes before impact with the Atlantic, around eight kilometres from Peggy\u2019s Cove.\n(Kai Reusser\/swissinfo.ch)\nA search-and-rescue operation was launched immediately, but it soon became clear there were no survivors. The initial focus of the recovery was finding and identifying human remains and recovering the flight recorders.\nThe wreckage recovery operation ended in December 1999 with 98% of the aircraft retrieved. All victims were eventually identified. Most were American, Swiss or French.\nSome two million pieces of debris, most of which had sunk to the ocean floor at a depth of 50-60 metres, were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility. Small material was inspected by teams looking for human remains, personal effects and valuables from the aircraft\u2019s cargo hold.\nThe aircraft\u2019s flight and cockpit voice recorders provided few clues to the disaster, having switched off before the crash. Investigators were left with little choice but to painstakingly reconstruct an 11-metre (36-foot) long segment of the MD-11\u2019s front end in an effort to shed light on possible causes.\nConsequences\nThe four-and-a-half-year investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) concluded that a fuse connected to the in-flight entertainment system had blown above the cockpit and flammable insulation material used in the aircraft\u2019s structure allowed a fire to spread beyond the control of the crew.\nIn October 1998, Swissair paid 156 families a total of CHF4.7 million ($4.8 million). The following March, the airline paid each of the victims\u2019 families CHF195,000. In March 2002, a US judge dismissed claims for CHF27 billion in punitive damages against Swissair, saying the disaster fell under the Death on the High Seas Actexternal link and the Warsaw Conventionexternal link.\nFive years after the crash, all but one claim for compensation had been resolved.\nIn its final report on the accidentexternal link, the TSB made a series of safety recommendations. For example, it urged regulators to develop tests and standards for flammability for all insulation materials on commercial jets. It also called for measures to improve the quality of cockpit voice recorders, ensuring that separate generators powered separate flight recorders so that at least one record would be left if one power system failed.\nCorporate reaction\nSwissair never really recovered from the accident. The downturn in the aviation market after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, proved to be the last straw for the heavily indebted national carrier, which folded the following year.\nIn this August 1999 recording by swissinfo.ch\u2019s predecessor Swiss Radio International, B\u00e9atrice Tschanz, head of corporate communications at SAirGroup, tells Vincent Landon about the aftermath of the crash.\nShe describes how ten days of intense pressure from US media let up once the Bill Clinton\/Monica Lewinsky scandal hit the headlines, how hard it was to act professionally during that time, her decision to allow her public relations team to spend CHF2 million on damage control, and the importance of corporations not developing a siege mentality in an emergency situation.\nswissinfo.ch\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n}}

{{UPDATE, 9:00 AM:\n(CNN) \u2014 The rescue effort at the site of a hot air balloon crash in Virginia has transitioned into a recovery operation, officials said Saturday. There were three occupants in the hot air balloon, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller said. One body has been recovered so far.\n\u2014\n(CNN) \u2014 A hot air balloon drifted into power lines, burst into flames and crashed into a Virginia countryside Friday night. Three people believed to be in the burning gondola are missing.\nImages from the scene showed the balloon soaring in the air with its bottom part ablaze.\nWitnesses described people falling or jumping out of its basket from dizzying heights.

They searched through the night with the help of police from two counties and officials from the Federal Aviation Administration.\nBalloon and gondola detached after the flames burst out, witnesses told police, so rescuers are fanning out over two areas in hopes of finding them.\nState troopers want to send up aircraft to scour the rural area from above, but stormy weather on the horizons saw them grounded early Saturday, Geller said.\nInclement weather was not a factor during the balloon\u2019s flight, Geller said.\nFestival of colors\nMeadow Event Park in Caroline County filled with people and bright colors Friday as passenger balloons swelled with hot air at the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival.\nTwenty balloon flying teams were expected to participate, organizers said. But after the tragedy, all events were canceled.\nLeading up to the accident, three inflatables went airborne and headed for a designated landing zone, Geller said. The first two landed normally, but the third hit an electric wire.\nFlames burst out, and the troubled balloon stayed aloft, where it could be seen in distress over a subdivision. Cell phone images showed its basket on fire high off the ground.\nThe pilot fought the blaze and opened the top of the balloon to let hot air out to prevent it from climbing farther, Geller said.\nTwo explosions rang out from the balloon, witnesses told police, then gondola and the balloon separated, and the inflatable soared skyward.\nDavid Griffith looked on in disbelief from below. \u201cThere was no way these people were coming out of that,\u201d he told WWBT.\nHe, too, said he saw two people plunge from the basket.\n}}

{{Stories by Lawani Mikairu\nNigerian airlines who intend to buy the controversial Boeing 737 MAX 800 have been advised by the public to suspend the idea as the safety confidence on the aircraft type has been badly eroded following the two successive fatal crashes involving B737 Max 800. According to some of the frequent fliers who spoke with Saturday Vanguard, Aviation business is built around safety confidence.\nThe same aircraft type, B-737-800MAX, had been ordered by two Nigerian airlines. Air Peace placed order for 10 and the other, Green Africa Airways, who is just processing its AOC, has been reported to have placed order for tens of the same planes valued at $11.7 billion dollars.\nHowever, Mr Chris Iwarah, Corporate Communications Manager, Air Peace, while clarifying the position of their order said: \u201cIt is imperative for the Management of Air Peace Airline to clarify that we recently placed a firm order for 10 brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. We are, however, yet to take delivery of the aircraft as we are still at the design and configuration stage of the order\u201d.\nAir travelers who spoke with Saturday Vanguard were unanimous in their comment, saying any Nigeria airline who had placed order for the aircraft type should not take delivery again but rather, replace the order to another type of plane. The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, has categorically stated that no Nigerian airline currently has the B737 MAX 800 in its fleet.\nRecall last Sunday, Ethiopian Airline plane ,B737 MAX 800, crashed in Addis Ababa in the early hours of Sunday Six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Bole International Airport, Ethiopia . There was no survivor among the 149 passengers and 8 crew on-board the flight. About 35 countries had nationals aboard the ill fated plane, with Kenya having the highest casualties of 32, followed by Canada 18, and Ethiopia with 9 people.\nWhile announcing the crash, the airline issued a statement saying : \u201cEthiopian Airlines regrets to confirm that its flight ET 302\/10 March on schedule service from Addis Ababa to Nairobi was involved in an accident today ( Sunday) around Bishoftu (Debre Zeit).The aircraft B-737-800MAX with registration number ET- AVJ took off at 08:38 am local time from Addis Ababa, Bole International Airport and lost contact at 08:44am. It is believed that there were 149 passengers and 8 crew on-board the flight but we are currently confirming the details of the passenger manifest for the flight\u201d.\nSimilar crash incident happened in Indonesia in October, 2018, six month ago when B737 MAX 800 aircraft operated by Lion Air crashed .The Lion Air JT610 with 189 people aboard went down off the coast of Indonesia, killing all 189 people on-board. That the crash followed the same pattern is what has kept aviation watchers worried and apprehensive.\nLion Air Flight 610 took off from Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 6:20 a.m. Oct. 29 in clear conditions. Just 12 minutes into its journey to Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang, it crashed into the sea off the coast of Java.\nMany countries have reacted by grounding all the B737 MAX 800 in the fleet of all the airlines operating in their countries. As the time of writing this report, more than ten countries have taken similar decision.\nThe Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika speaking to newsmen on the development in Abuja recently, stated that directives have been issued to that effect.\nHe said : \u201cRegardless of the enormous safety records of this machine, it has caused concern in the world of aviation. You know aviation is universal, there is no aviation A or B.\n\u201cWe have issued directives that no operator with Boeing 737 Max aircraft should operate into or out of the country\u2019s airports.\u201d\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation in India on Monday issued additional safety instructions to two Indian carriers that operate the Boeing 737 Max aircraft. Pilots of SpiceJet and Jet Airways should have at least 1,000 hours of flying experience to command these planes, PTI reported.\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump of United States of America, grounded the type of aircraft involved in both crashes \u2014 Boeing 737 Max \u2014 following the European Union and more than a dozen other nations that took action earlier in the week.\nThe USA Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s order to ground the planes states that the similarities between the two crashes \u201cwarrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.\u201d\nAfter the Indonesia crash , air accident investigators and experts discovered that the less than three months old plane had a new software in it. They called it \u201cMCAS or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentations System. MCAS was a system that didn\u2019t exist in any of the Boeing 737\u2019s before. However, when they built the 737 MAX version, in layman\u2019s term, they built the plane with a larger and more efficient engine\u201d.\n\u201cHowever, this larger engine, which delivered a further 14% fuel efficiency had to be fitted further forward under the low wings of the 737. This potentially may cause the plane to stall. Stalling is bad. It is basically when a plane stops flying and starts falling. In order to avoid this, Boeing installed the new MCAS software. This software is designed to tell the plane to move its nose down to increase its speed and avoid it from stalling\u201d.\n\u201cOn the plane there is a sensor called the Alpha Vane which measures the Angle of Attack (AOA) of the plane. It looks like a small little wing, and they have two of it, one on the pilot side, and the other on the co-pilot\u2019s. The sensor\u2019s job is to tell the computer the angle the plane is flying at. And if the AOA of the plane is too high, this will result in the plane stalling. Typically the AOA is below 15 to 20 degrees, and the new MCAS software will push the plane\u2019s nose down if it thinks that the AOA is too high\u201d.\n\u201cWith flight JT610, the Alpha Vane sensor measuring the AOA on the Captain\u2019s side was reported to be faulty. So they changed it. That fault was reported from the equally harrowing flight from Bali to Jakarta. On the fateful final flight, the plane which arrived from Bali the night before, had the sensor changed, and then it took off in the morning\u201d.\n\u201cNo one knew what was really wrong with the plane, or about the new MCAS software. No one. Not the maintenance folks, and in fact not even the pilot. He apparently wasn\u2019t trained on it yet. And once in the air, the faulty sensor told the computer that the plane is stalling. The computer then, without the pilot ever knowing pushed the nose of the plane down further, while the pilot was trying to raise the plane\u201d.\n\u201cIn this battle between the pilot and the computer, the computer won. And the pilot, the crew, and the passengers lost and they died. The plane was too low, and the pilot didn\u2019t have enough air to raise the plane and fly it. The computer literally flew the plane into the ocean\u201d.\nA few weeks later, Boeing issued an update on the plane, and informed that should the plane have an issue with it\u2019s AOA sensors, one of the ways to stop the computer was to switch it off!\n}}

{{ZURICH (Reuters) - Experts from Siemens are helping Hungarian authorities with their investigation after an experimental aircraft powered by one of the German company\u2019s electric motors crashed, killing its pilot and passenger.\nThe single-engined Magnus eFusion aircraft crashed shortly after take-off at an airfield near Budapest on May 31, Siemens said on Wednesday, confirming reports that had appeared in other media.\n\u201cWe can confirm that an accident happened to an experimental airplane featuring our electric propulsion unit,\u201d Siemens said in a statement.\nSiemens could not comment on the cause of the accident, and said it was working with the Transportation Safety Bureau of Hungary, the Hungarian Aviation Authority Bureau and local police. A team from Siemens in Hungary was also helping with the inquiry to establish the cause, a company spokesman said.\nSiemens has been working with Magnus, a Hungarian aircraft manufacturer, for more than two years, and supplied an electric engine and components for the aircraft that has been flying since 2016.\n\u201cAs a precautionary measure we decided to ground the Magnus eFusion aircraft fleet until we know the cause of this tragic accident,\u201d Siemens said. The grounding order will affect three other Magnus eFusion planes.\nMagnus Aircraft said in a statement that the plane had crashed for unknown reasons while on a test flight. Further announcements would only be made after the results of the experts\u2019 report were known, it said.\nSiemens in recent years has been working on developing electric motors for aircraft, and two years ago signed a collaboration agreement with Airbus to develop propulsion systems for electrically-powered passenger planes.\n}}

The headlines that appeared in the Aug. 26, 1948, Herald blared: \"Nine Die in Crash of C-47 on E.H. Blakeslee Farm -- Worst Plane Accident in History of Sussex County.\"\nThe article commenced: \"The worst plane accident in the history of Sussex County occurred on the E.H. Blakeslee farm at 1:10 p.m. on Monday, when a C-47 Army transport crashed and burned, killing nine men.\" The article continued: \"The plane was seen flying at low level and apparently in distress by several Sussex County residents. Charles Emmons of Halsey said the plane flew over at low level, turned and the pilot attempted to gain altitude. It rose, then leveled off, and a minute later crashed.\"\nLater in the article it was written: \"Cpl. Loesser and Trooper Walters, of Sussex; Trooper Lattimore and Detective (Terrence) Gillen, of Newton; and Lt. A.H. Albrecht, of Morristown, who happened to be near, all picked up the radio call and hastened to the scene. By the time they reached the spot, there were nothing left but charred bodies and charred pieces of wreckage. Capt. R.A. Miller, Base Operations, Stewart Field, Newburgh, N.Y., said Monday evening that the destruction of the plane was so complete nothing could be salvaged.\n\"The force of the explosion blew pieces of the plane over a wide area. Bodies of the victims were scattered about and parts of arms and legs were found some distance from the larger pieces of the plane.\"\nIn explaining how the tragic accident happened the newspaper article continued: \"Shortly before the crash, the transport and a B-25 bomber scraped each other at an altitude of 7,000 feet. Lt. David F. Tatum, pilot of the bomber, radioed Mitchell Field, L.I., that he had scraped against a C-47. The bomber continued to Stewart Field, Newburgh, N.Y., where the plane landed safely. The crew stated they were flying at cloud level when suddenly a plane seemed to loom out of the clouds. The B-25 veered sharply and they felt a slight jolt. They then noticed the damaged left wing and returned to Stewart Field.\n\"No one of the crew of the bomber was hurt. The transport lost a section of wing over Route S-31 at Red Top Farm, and some more pieces on the top of another hill before crashing on the Blakeslee farm.\"\nThe crew members who lost their lives included Capt. William D. Betty Jr., 30, of Portland, Maine, pilot; Capt. John Fritts Jr., 26, of Virginia Beach, Va., co-pilot; and Tec. Sgt. John Stringer, 31, of Washington, engineer, according to officials at Bolling Field.\nThe six passengers were identified as \"enlisted men handpicked by their commands for the privilege of attending a Protestant layman's retreat of U.S. Air Force chaplains in Connecticut. It was emphasized that these six were neither assistant chaplains nor personnel officially connected with Army religious work. The Air Force identified four of the six as Pfc. Fred Anderson, 18; Pfc. James E. Ford, 24; Sgt. Forrest J. Grate, 20; and Pfc. Bernard E. Mahoney, 18.\"\n(Warning. Proceed with caution. Some of the details are rather gruesome and gory at best.)\nBranchville resident Bill Bathgate shared his memories of that fateful day, when as an 11-year-old boy he experienced witnessing the devastating impact of that tragic airplane crash.\nBathgate and his Dad, Bill Sr., were sitting on bar stools at Lew's Bar and Grill, located at the intersection of Route 206 and Pines Road, where the regulars referred to it as \"going to Sunday School.\" Bill was enjoying a Kelly's Root Beer while his dad had Ballantine Ale.\nA telephone call abruptly ended the day's pleasure. Bathgate recalled that Lew ordered his dad to \"run next door to my garage, get the ambulance out and head to Russ Blakeslee's farm. There's been a bad two-airplane collision and one has hit the ground.\"\n\"It seemed in an instant that we had flown clear of our stools and were entering the front seat of the dust covered vintage ambulance.\" Bathgate paused in his narration to muse, \"Why Lew had this old vehicle in his garage baffles me to this day.\"\nTheir route to the scene was 206 south to Augusta Hill Road and then to 519. Just past the intersection of Augusta Hill Road and 519, in the first meadow on the left, was the downed airplane. It had taken seven minutes for them to arrive.\n\"When Dad and I exited the ambulance, we heard the sound of sirens blaring from all the surrounding municipalities, the whine of a less formative siren on a state trooper's motorcycle, and we saw a large number of people on foot racing through the meadow. Secondly, and much more predominate, was the abominable, indescribable stench of a burning aircraft, burning fuel and burning flesh that permeated the atmosphere.\"\nContinuing, Bathgate explained: \"To reach the area of devastation one would have to cross through a barbed wire fence. With left hand grabbing the upper strand of wire and the right hand the same for the middle strand, then pressuring each in opposing directions so that my body would be able to pass through that expanse, I proceeded. For a country boy, this was nothing new and had been accomplished many times before. This time, though, would be much different and wind up with a horrid encounter. For, in my zeal to get to the scene, not much attention had been paid to the act of passing through the fence, but this time there was something different. Feeling a distinct back and forth swaying motion of the upper strand caused me to look upward. A very small twig from a wild bush was making contact with the wire; however, this was not the cause of the heavy swaying. Looking farther beyond, I saw a smoldering head staring straight at me, caught by its few remaining stands of hair on the fence. My grabbing the upper wire must have generated the swaying motion.\n\"Transfixed between two strands of barbed wire, shock must have been my nemesis. It seemed like an eternity standing in that position. The sight of this head, a large portion looking like a charred black marshmallow and the remaining portion appearing as a huge blister with the one lidless eyeball staring straight through it, would have a haunting effect on me for weeks to come.\"\nContinuing, Bathgate recalled: \"Pieces of aircraft and human remains were smoldering and in flames in an area encompassing a half mile. Body parts were everywhere. My first observation was that of an Army boot with the calf of a leg protruding from it. Continuing on through this abomination of humanity, we saw more carnage than any 11-year-old should have ever seen. By now, the smell and taste of the atmosphere seemed so much stronger as it clung to my nostrils and lungs. One large area of the scene looked as though it had been bleached. This was where the aircraft had made impact and the intense heat had transformed the earth to glass and bleached the rocks.\"\nBathgate concluded by observing that it was a long, long time before he went to \"Sunday School\" with his dad. Summing up his recollections of that tragic event of 70 years ago, when the worst airplane crash in the history of Sussex County resulted in the loss of nine lives, he sums it up by saying, \"I never wanted to be the first on scene for anything again, nor did I ever want to brag about that day to my friends.\"\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nJennie Sweetman is the history columnist for he New Jersey Herald.

We didn't receive any 911 calls or calls of reckless drivers immediately prior to [the crash],\" Stromberg said.\nPolice say Becerril, who was driving, and Martinez-Gonzalez, the front seat passenger, were not restrained while Martinez-Guerra was wearing a seat belt. All three are believed to have died on impact.\n\"It's a tragedy to be sure,\" said Stromberg.\nWhile the crash remains under investigation, police stated two factors are believed to have played a role in this crash.\nSpeed, \"at this point we would probably say in excess of 50 to 60 miles per hour,\" Stromberg said, and chemical impairment, \"alcohol related impairments, as well as narcotic substances. So we're investigating impairment on all fronts at this time.\"\nIt could take weeks for police to receive a toxicology report back from the Medical Examiner to determine exactly what substances were involved and how large of a role they played in this crash, according to Herriman City Police.\nPolice said despite this tragedy, it is lucky that this is all that happened.\n\"It was likely that there was other traffic on the road when this happened,\" said Stromberg. \"Could have easily impacted another vehicle and magnified this tragedy even further.\"\n\"We just encourage everybody to always wear your seat belt, buckle up. It doesn't matter if you're driving down the street or across the valley, wear your seat belt,\" Stromberg said. \"Obey posted speed limit signs and traffic control devices and never drive impaired.\"\nFox 13 News will update this story as more details emerge.\n}}

{{True or false: Canada\u2019s history is rife with colourful anecdotes and fun facts that a majority of residents simply don\u2019t know about.\nTrue, of course, at least according to a poll released last week by Historica Canada.\nThe organization behind the country\u2019s Heritage Minutes compiled a list of 30 statements framed as bits of Canadian trivia and asked respondents to say whether the statements were true or false.\nThe survey found 62% of those who took the quiz did not pass, suggesting Canadians were largely unaware of some captivating anecdotes.\nMost poll respondents, for instance, had never heard the true stories of how future prime minister John Turner once rescued former prime minister John Diefenbaker from the ocean in Barbados while both were on vacation in 1965.\nOr the time the Montreal Canadiens lost the Stanley Cup on the side of the road while changing a tire, only to find it later.\nThe majority of respondents were also unable to pick out the tallest Canadian tales, falsely believing that Zamboni racing was included in the 1988 Calgary Olympics as a demonstration sport.\nAnthony Wilson-Smith, chief executive officer of Historica Canada, said the light-hearted poll should not be used as a bellwether for Canadians\u2019 knowledge of their own history. It should, however, stand as a reminder that fun facts can lay the groundwork for more in-depth historical exploration.\n\u201cA lot of this goes to the root of people saying that Canadian history isn\u2019t as interesting as that of any other country,\u201d Wilson-Smith said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s true in the sense that we haven\u2019t had a revolution and our wars have been off our soil. But it ignores the fact that there are no end of interesting people and events that people just don\u2019t know enough about.\u201d\nThe latest Historica poll, conducted by Ipsos, found that ignorance of quirky Canadiana transcended age brackets and geographical locations.\nThe average grade for the quiz\u2019s 1,000 respondents was a mere 13 out of 30, or a failing grade of 43%.\nWhile participants in Saskatchewan and Manitoba fared the best, 53% of them still could not manage a passing grade.\nAge made little difference, although respondents between 18 and 34 had only a 59% failure rate compared to 66% among those 35 to 64 and 60% for those over 65.\nThe online poll was conducted between June 13 and 15. The polling industry\u2019s professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error as they are not a random sample and therefore are not necessarily representative of the whole population.\nWilson-Smith conceded that some of the questions were fairly obscure, though even those that have had recent moments in the cultural limelight stumped the bulk of those who took the quiz.\nDespite the resurgence in popularity for superhero franchises in general and the \u201cX-Men\u201d brand in particular, only 48% of respondents knew that primary character Wolverine had a Canadian backstory based on his birth in Alberta.\nOnly 36% of survey participants knew that A-list actor Kiefer Sutherland was the grandson of Tommy Douglas, widely viewed as the father of universal health care.\nRespondents performed worst on questions focusing on history or sports, Historica said, citing the fact that only 33% knew that the electric light bulb was originally invented by two Canadians who sold the patent to Thomas Edison.\nOnly 24% of those asked recognized the truth behind hockey legend Paul Henderson\u2019s uniquely Canadian back story. The hero of the 1972 Summit Series was born in a sleigh on Lake Huron.\nParticipants were quicker to spot the true statements among general knowledge questions, however, with the majority knowing that Canada produces roughly 80% of the world\u2019s maple syrup and that Ottawa\u2019s Rideau Canal becomes the world\u2019s largest skating rink when winter temperatures set in.\nIf the world has failed to give Canada its due for being the home of the jock strap and the Wonderbra, it\u2019s not alone \u2014 53% of quiz-takers didn\u2019t do so either.\nPast Historica surveys suggest knowledge gaps in Canadian history are not confined to the kind of questions one might find in a game of Trivial Pursuit, which is itself a Canadian invention.\nAt least 44% of those polled in one previous survey could not name 2017 as the date of Canada\u2019s 150th birthday, while only two in five of those asked in another knew that Sir John A. MacDonald was the country\u2019s first prime minister.\nWilson-Smith said he hopes tidbits of national trivia may peak people\u2019s interest in their own heritage and prompt them to take a deeper dive into Canadian history as a whole.\n\u201cWhere is it written that history cannot be fun? History becomes that way when you learn really engaging facts about people and events,\u201d he said. \u201cIn and of themselves they won\u2019t teach you everything you need to know, but these things open the door to saying, \u2018I want to learn more.\u201d\u2018\n}}

{{STUTTGART, Germany (AP) - Simone Biles started off 2019 the same way she ended 2018: atop the podium.\nThe reigning world and Olympic all-around gymnastics champion easily won her 2019 debut at the DTB Pokal World Cup on Sunday. The 22-year-old posted an all-around score of 58.800, more than 3.5 points clear of runner-up Ana Padurariu of Canada and third-place finisher Elisabeth Seitz of Germany.\nBiles hardly looked rusty in her first competition since winning six medals - four gold - at the 2018 world championships last fall. She put up the top scores in the nine-woman field on vault, uneven bars and floor exercise and placed second on balance beam. Her lone missteps came on floor exercise, where the world champion stepped out at the end of a tumbling pass, and on beam, where she wobbled briefly.\nBiles extended a winning streak that dates to the 2013 US Championships.\nThe meet is a warm-up of sorts for Biles.

{{Tape-wrapped Olympic rings stand in front of the Rio Olympic golf course on July 31, 2016. Photo: EMMANUEL DUNAND\/EMMANUEL DUNAND\/AFP\/Getty Images\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics kick off this Friday, and Rio de Janeiro is so committed to getting everything right that, even as athletes arrive, workers are flitting about the buildings constructed for the Games, making minor improvements (like tidying up collapsed structures, making the toilets flush, and figuring out why the fire alarms don\u2019t work). Here\u2019s a look at some of the extremely new venues constructed for the Games.\nBeach Volleyball Arena\nConstructing a stadium as tall as a seven-story building on the edge of the beach doesn\u2019t sound like the smartest idea, but rest assured that Rio\u2019s beach-volleyball arena has all of the latest safety features \u2014 because workers were still putting the finishing touches on it in late July.\nWork continues on the beach-volleyball arena on July 25, 2016. Photo: Matthew Stockman\/Getty Images\nThe Rio Olympics website describes the venue as \u201can impressive temporary structure situated on the sands of Copacabana beach,\u201d and the fact that athletes will be competing there next week is certainly impressive. Last month there were concerns that the arena would not be completed in time after work stalled for four days because of a missing permit, and the structure was damaged by waves.\nWorkers continue construction on the site for the beach-volleyball competitions on July 13, 2016. Photo: Dado Galdieri\/Bloomberg\nSpectators are understandably eager to see the arena, but they should probably hold off until more security is in place. Last month the New York Times\u2019 Vanessa Barbara reported after visiting the site:\nWorkers erected a six-foot-high sand barrier to protect the site. It also protects thugs; tourists are being mugged behind it. A construction worker told me he\u2019d seen a man stabbed there, and warned me to stay away. The robbers were so comfortable that they had left their backpacks and a beach chair nearby on the sand.\nPlus, there\u2019s the risk of encountering human body parts on the shore.\nMarina da Gl\u00f3ria\nSome people were alarmed when the main ramp of the Olympic sailing venue, which allows boats to get into the water, collapsed on Sunday because of wind and ten-foot-high waves. But according to the International Olympic Committee, this is just part of the Olympic experience, not a sign that the Rio Games are a $4.1 billion accident waiting to happen. \u201cIn the run-up to the games things happen,\u201d IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said. \u201cIt would be wrong to make a great deal out of it.\u201d\nA ramp hangs after collapsing at the Marina da Gloria. Photo: Buda Mendes\/Getty Images\nThe ramp should be repaired by Friday, and the athletes remain focused on the task ahead of them. Specifically, avoiding the bacteria and floating garbage in the water surrounding Rio.\nLast summer, the Associated Press reported that the water was \u201cso contaminated with human feces that [athletes] risk becoming violently ill and unable to compete in the games.\u201d Sure enough, 13 U.S. swimmers developed stomach illnesses during trial championships a few weeks later. Independent testing found the water was 1.7 million times more disease-ridden than what would be tolerated at a beach in California, and athletes who consume just three teaspoons of water have a 99 percent chance of infection.\nOn the bright side, Olympians now have an opportunity to show that they\u2019re creative, not just athletically talented. The U.S. Olympic rowing team will be wearing seamless, antimicrobial unisuits to protect themselves. Helicopters will be deployed every morning to point out floating garbage. And, two weeks ago, Australian sailors Mat Belcher and Will Ryan told the AAP they\u2019re developing a special routine to avoid obstacles like dead animals and plastic bags:\n\u201c Two or three times a day we would be caught up with rubbish on our foil,\u201d Belcher told AAP from Rio.\n\u201cWe need to stop, slow the boat down completely and raise our foils.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better, hopefully we can get it down to one or two a week.\u201d\nAnd if all else fails, health experts have some simple advice: Keep your mouth closed.\nOlympic Velodrome\nRio\u2019s Olympic velodrome offers more proof that concerns about this year\u2019s Games are overblown. The site of the track cycling competition suffered multiple delays, several test events were canceled, and at one point it looked like the venue might never be built. But after switching contractors in May, the velodrome was completed just in time.\nWork continues in the Olympic velodrome on July 25, 2016. Photo: Matthew Stockman\/Getty Images\nOn Monday, Cycling New Zealand high performance director Mark Elliott reported that the velodrome is ready to go, though \u201cit\u2019s a bit dusty in there and they\u2019ll have to do some work to make sure they keep it clean.\u201d\nHe noted that in a newly constructed velodrome \u201cthere\u2019s always dust coming down from the ceiling,\u201d and \u201cyou know, it\u2019s round, it\u2019s a piece of wood, and we\u2019ll all go the same direction.\u201d Plus, you can\u2019t really complain about a little dust when other athletes are swimming through poop-infested waters.\nOlympic Golf Course\nGolf Digest calls the course constructed for the sport\u2019s return to the Olympics \u201ca work of art.\u201d Unfortunately, many top players won\u2019t get to see it because they\u2019re skipping the Games over concerns about Zika. And constructing it wasn\u2019t easy, as the New York Times explains:\nAlong the way, there were setbacks and logistical delays, including late paychecks, limited resources, equipment issues, environmental protests, bureaucratic roadblocks, debates over land ownership and a monthslong legal battle in which the builders were accused of violating environmental regulations.\nThe builders were prohibited from removing or adding any soil to the course and were forced to dig below sand deposits for usable soil. Chemicals were banned. Sand was recycled for traps.\nBut now that Rio has the $23 million course, it all seems worth it, especially because once the games are over the site will be enjoyed by \u2014 dozens of? \u2014 Brazilian golfers. It\u2019s set to become the country\u2019s first public golf course once the Games are over; though, as the Times\u2019 Vanessa Barbara notes, \u201cThe city already has two big golf courses, and very few Brazilians play golf.\u201d\nAerial view of the Olympic golf course in Rio de Janeiro on July 26, 2016.

In late July, Kitty Chiller, the chef de mission in Rio de Janeiro for the Australian Olympic Committee, said that no one from Team Australia would be moving into their assigned building over concerns about the electricity, plumbing, and gas. She continued:\nProblems include blocked toilets, leaking pipes, exposed wiring, darkened stairwells where no lighting has been installed and dirty floors in need of a massive clean.\nIn operations areas water has come through the ceiling resulting in large puddles on the floor around cabling and wiring.\nFotos das instala\u00e7\u00f5es da Vila Ol\u00edmpica alvo d cr\u00edticas da delega\u00e7\u00e3o australiana https:\/\/t.co\/pZQPePpHlr #RioProblems pic.twitter.com\/Z3rr0sAh6a \u2014 Gabriel Ferreira (@GabrielF_SLZ) July 25, 2016\nBut New Zealand and Italy said their accommodations were fine (after they hired their own crews to fix the electricity and plumbing). And Chiller said the organizers made \u201cfantastic progress\u201d in resolving the issue (after she generated negative headlines worldwide). Only two-thirds of the 31 17-story buildings constructed for the athletes passed safety inspections by July 25, but officials said the rest would be ready by the end of the week.\nEventually, the Australian athletes moved into the Olympic village \u2014 then, over the weekend, a fire broke out in their \u201csmoke free\u201d building when someone threw a cigarette into a pile of garbage in the basement.\nAll athletes were safely evacuated and are now back in the building pic.twitter.com\/d5P8APqgZK \u2014 AUS Olympic Team (@AUSOlympicTeam) July 29, 2016\nThen some clothing and a laptop were stolen from their rooms while the fire was being extinguished. And news of the fire spread by word of mouth because the fire alarms weren\u2019t working. But on the plus side, we haven\u2019t heard any reports that the athletes\u2019 village is inhabited by packs of stray dogs.\n}}

{{OTTAWA \u2014 With the hometown crowd nervously waiting to roar its approval, Rachel Homan got in the hack and did what she always does.\nLooking at three Jennifer Jones rocks that could have amounted to a devastating steal, Homan calmly sailed her final rock down the ice and made a takeout for one point to clinch a 6-3 win in the semifinal of the Canadian Olympic curling trials at the Canadian Tire Centre.\nIt was fitting because Homan is the best hitter in the world and she put those skills on full display for the 7,001 fans in her home city. She was lights out all day, curling an impressive 93% for the win.\nWas she nervous about the winning shot?\n\u201cI had nerves from End 1 through to 10,\u201d Homan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big shot, it\u2019s a big moment every time you\u2019re in the hack. You just learn to play with those nerves and embrace it and enjoy the moment.\u201d\nShe\u2019ll get a chance to enjoy another moment when her team of Emma Miskew, Joanne Courtney and Lisa Weagle takes on Calgary\u2019s Chelsea Carey in Sunday\u2019s final (2 p.m.). The winner will represent Canada in the Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, Feb. 9-25.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling to finally be in the finals, exactly where we wanted to be,\u201d Homan said. \u201cWe got to play today against an unbelievable team that threw everything at us and we played a solid game. We feel really ready to come out (Sunday) and bring our A-game.\n\u201cIt feels really good to play that well against Jennifer Jones. It feels great to be able to pull that off and feel really confident after that win.\u201d\nHoman won her eighth straight game since losing the trials opener to Carey last Saturday.\nCarey will have the hammer in the first end. Teams that have hammer in the first end win 55% of games. Carey has a 21-6 record in games in which her team starts with hammer. Homan is 10-7 when starting without hammer.\nHowever, Homan will have home-ice advantage, with a large crowd again squarely on her side.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate enough to be in this position, in our hometown, in front of the crowd,\u201d Homan said. \u201cJust going to enjoy every moment tomorrow and really relish that we\u2019re the hometown team.\u201d\nThe reigning world champions and three time Canadian winners will look to add an Olympic appearance to their list of impressive accomplishments.\nStanding in the way is Carey, who won the 2016 Canadian championship but did not medal at the worlds. Carey\u2019s third is Cathy Overton-Clapham, who has won five Canadian championships and one world title and lead Laine Peters has been to six world championships, though four times it was as an alternate.\nCarey, 33, didn\u2019t even watch Saturday\u2019s semifinal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that \u2026 it\u2019s not beneficial to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t need to get caught up in that.\u201d\nShe is, of course, aware that Homan has the best hitting team in women\u2019s curling, and she\u2019ll have to try to take away those opportunities as best as possible.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do anything about that,\u201d Carey said. \u201cYou just have to be pretty precise with your rock placement.\u201d\nFor Jones, a 43-year-old mother of two, the loss marked the end of her reign as Olympic champion. Her team of Kaitlyn Lawes, Jill Officer and Dawn McEwen, won the gold medal in 2014 in Sochi and were looking to be first team to repeat.\n\u201cYou work really hard for this for four years so you\u2019re kind of gutted a little bit,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, we\u2019re OK.\n\u201cOnce an Olympian, always an Olympian, so we\u2019re OK.\u201d\nHoman was in control from the get-go against Jones, scoring one with the hammer in the second end, stealing one in the third, scoring a deuce with hammer in the fifth, stealing one in the seventh and finishing it off with her nose hit for one in the 10th.\nJones curled just 76% as her team lost its fourth straight game. At one point in the week, they were 5-0 and were riding a 19-game winning streak overall.\n\u201cWe probably didn\u2019t adapt to the ice as well as we needed to,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe tried really hard to do it but it just didn\u2019t happen. We had chances and didn\u2019t make the big shot later in the week. In order to be successful you have to make the big ones when they matter.\u201d\nTwyman@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com\/Ted_Wyman\n}}

{{Judo fighter Majlinda Kelmendi has been told she cannot compete for Kosovo at this summer's Olympics.\nAlthough Kosovo declared independence from Serbia four years ago, it is not formally recognised as a nation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\nThe IOC also turned down Kelmendi's request to compete as an independent athlete and she will now represent Albania at London 2012.\n\"It is not good news,\" she said, after the decision was announced.\n\"I was born in Kosovo and became an athlete in Kosovo and have enjoyed the greatest support in Kosovo.\nMAJLINDA KELMENDI - THE FACTS Home town: Peja, Kosovo\nPeja, Kosovo Year of birth: 1991\n1991 Discipline: Judo\nJudo Career highlights: Gold medal, 2009 World Junior Championships, Paris\n\"This is nothing more than just politics. There are many states that do not support and do not want Kosovo.\n\"Unfortunately, Kosovo is a small country and maybe not that strong politically for the time being, and it is not strong enough to influence some things.\"\nThe Balkan state, whose population is made up of ethnic Albanians and Serbs, has been campaigning for international recognition since seceding from Serbia in 2008.\nAnd although 90 countries now support its membership of the United Nations, opposition from Serbia, backed by Russia, has impeded the campaign.\nKosovo's quest for sporting recognition has met with similar resistance. Very few of the world's sporting federations accept Kosovo as an independent state, leaving many of Kosovo's top athletes unable to compete at international tournaments.\nWorld football's governing body Fifa became the sixth organisation to recognise Kosovo last month when President Sepp Blatter announced that Kosovo had been given dispensation to play friendly matches - a decision that will eventually lead to full membership.\nMajlinda Kelmendi holds both Albanian and Kosovan passports and in 2009 won gold at the world junior championships under the Albanian flag.\nIn recent years, she has competed at tournaments as an independent athlete because the International Judo Federation (IJF) has not, until recently, acknowledged Kosovo's independence.\nIn May she secured her place for London 2012 by finishing fifth in the Olympic qualification rankings.\nFearing she would not be allowed to represent her homeland, the Kosovan Olympic Committee asked the IOC if she could fight as an independent athlete, following the precedent set when four athletes from East Timor did so in 2000.\nHowever, the IOC took the view that as Kelmendi has previously competed as an Albanian, she should do so again in London.\n\"She received Olympic scholarships for Albania, she has an Albanian passport, the Albanian national Olympic committee is ready to select her for the Olympic Games and, as the conditions were not met to participate under the Olympic flag, she will be able to participate under the Albanian flag,\" said IOC president Jacques Rogge.\nKelmendi's coach, Driton Kuka, missed out on his chance to compete in the Olympics when war broke out in Yugoslavia ahead of the Barcelona Games in 1992, and he joined the Kosovan Liberation Army.\nThe majority of Kosovo's inhabitants are ethnic Albanians so the decision to ask Kelmendi to compete for Albania is an acceptable compromise.\n\"Finally, we are all Albanians. It is good that I can at least compete for Albania. Not like my coach, who was unlucky not to go at all,\" she said.\n}}

{{REGINA \u2014 Colleen Sostorics believes in storybook endings.\nShe helped author one in February by helping the Canadian women's hockey team win an Olympic gold medal on home soil in Vancouver. As a result, Sostorics was presented with a golden opportunity to walk away at the pinnacle of her sport \u2014 a perfectly scripted end to a storybook career.\n\"I don't know if you can top that as an athlete,\" offered the 30-year-old native of Kennedy. \"I knew I was going to try to make this team and hopefully win a gold medal for Canada. Once that was accomplished it took a few months to think about it and decide. Four years is a long time until the next Olympics and I think that was kind of out of the question. Might as well hang 'em up now and see what's next.\"\nThat's not to say it was easy. The word \"retire\" is rarely one that rolls off the tongue of any elite athlete, Sostorics included.\n\"Of course it was a difficult decision but I know it's the right decision,\" said the third-highest scoring defender in Team Canada history. \"I've had a really rewarding career. Now I'm just looking forward to what comes next, all the adventures and challenges that will go with the second stage of my life.\"\nSostorics' immediate plans include returning to the family farm to help her dad finish the harvest, something she hasn't been able to do for many years. Sostorics is also enjoying her time on the motivational speaking circuit. In the longer term, she's hoping to pursue a career that keeps her involved in sports, be it in coaching or administration.\n\"I just feel that's where my passion lies,\" said Sostorics, who has a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Calgary. \"I think we all know, all of us Canadians, this game gets in your blood. You can't ever leave it for good. It's the game I love and it has played such a major role in my life.

I'm just proud that maybe I played a very small part in that.\n\"I'm hoping that later on in my life I'll be able to sit on my couch and watch women playing in a professional league. That's a bit of a dream of mine and I hope it will happen, as I'm sure it will. As for kids in Saskatchewan, Hayley (Wickenheiser) is the only Sask person left on the team at this point so I'm hoping there will be a lot of young players coming up that aspire to and achieve the dream of playing on Team Canada.\"\nAsked what she'll miss most, Sostorics cited the thrill and fight of competition, along with the time spent behind the scenes with teammates. She also didn't have to look far for a career highlight.\n\"Having a chance to step on the ice at GM Place in front of the Canadian fans and get that gold medal with my teammates who had fought so hard all year, that's definitely a highlight of my career,\" she added. \"But, looking back at it, there have been so many other highlights that weren't necessarily involving gold medals.

{{Brazilian marines on Flamengo Beach, near the site that will host the sailing competitions of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, during a security drill.\nIn July, Brazilian authorities rounded up a dozen men who identified themselves as \u201cDefenders of Sharia.\u201d The suspects, all Brazilian citizens, were allegedly plotting an attack on the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. News of the foiled terror threat landed just three weeks before the start of an already-fraught Olympics, and one week after a French-Tunisian man plowed a semitruck through hundreds of revelers on the French Riviera.\nRecent attacks and Brazil\u2019s terror arrests renewed worries that the Olympic host country is playing anti-terror catch-up. Officials have revised security plans and introduced brand-new protocols after Nice. The armed forces and police conducted comprehensive drills weeks before the torch ceremony.\nBrazil holds firm that the terror threat remains low. The Brazilian justice minister, Alexandre de Moraes, described the Olympic cell as \u201cabsolutely amateur.\u201d The men had never met. Instead, they messaged and boasted over Telegram and WhatsApp, cheering the Orlando nightclub massacre and the rampage in Nice. They pledged allegiance to ISIS \u2014 but had no real ties to the terror group. The suspects didn\u2019t actually get very far in their scheming. They had not selected a specific target at the Games, and talked about getting lessons in how to shoot and in martial arts. None had stockpiled explosives or weapons, though at least one member of the cell had attempted to buy an AK-47 from an illegal seller in Paraguay. Authorities, who\u2019d been monitoring the chatter for months (with some reported help from the FBI), considered this a \u201cpreparatory act.\u201d Officials moved in and arrested ten individuals, with two more detained later that week. \u201cObviously we cannot \u2013 no security force \u2013 ignore this,\u201d Moraes said. \u201cJust the fact that they started preparatory acts, it would not be sensible to wait and see, and the best was to order their arrest.\u201d\nA security drill from February 2016.

About a week later, in an unrelated case, police arrested a 34-year-old Rio resident and car salesman of Lebanese descent for suspected ISIS sympathies. Together, these were the first arrests under Brazil\u2019s new and controversial anti-terror law, which President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 now suspended from office as she faces an impeachment trial \u2014 signed last spring amid sharp criticism that it targeted social and political movements in a country where terrorism isn\u2019t a top concern. \u201cThis is quite new territory,\u201d said Manoel Gehrke, a Ph.D. student at UCLA who specializes in Brazilian politics.\nBrazil\u2019s big world-stage coming-out \u2014 even more so than the World Cup in 2014 \u2014 was bound to bring with it a terror threat. Nothing new for an Olympic host. But the visibility of extremist propaganda ahead of Rio is different. \u201cIn previous years, such threats would have been made to highly limited audiences on deep web forums, jihadists are now posting them on social media, making their messages much farther reaching and thus much more dangerous,\u201d wrote Rita Katz at SITE Intelligence Group.\n#ISIS Telegram Ansar Al Khilafah Brazil incitement in Portuguese.\nCanal Telegram com alegadas incita\u00e7\u00f5es Jihadistas pic.twitter.com\/PijtI7bzQg \u2014 GlobalIntelInsight (@global_awar) July 20, 2016\n\u201cBrazil, you are our next target,\u201d an ISIS supporter tweeted after terrorists\u2019 bloody rampage in Paris in November.

The government had already planned on a security force of about 88,000, made up mostly of military and state and local police officers deployed across Rio de Janeiro and in other locales hosting events (mostly soccer matches). Spectators will be searched before entering Olympic venues, and plainclothes officers will be posted throughout the event sites.\nThe country created the first-ever Olympics counterterrorism center, staffed with law-enforcement officials from countries including the United States, Spain, France, and Argentina. The center checked up on the 460,000 people who applied for credentials to the Games, and flagged 11,000 for the Olympic Committee. At least four applicants with known links to terror had tried to gain access, Brazil\u2019s Olympic security coordinator told Brazilian television program Fantastico. At least 40 others had been under international surveillance, though not necessarily for terrorism.\nAs with the counterterrorism center, Brazil is working closely with foreign intelligence and defense officials. The United States is at the top of the list. Defense officials trained Brazilian authorities on chemical- and radioactive-weapons decontamination tactics in March. Last year, Brazil sent its police officers to study best practices at major sporting events, including the Boston Marathon and the Super Bowl, says the Justice ministry.\nFrance has also been working closely with Brazilian forces (a fact pro-jihadi channels mocked), though last week a French minister said its intelligence services had interrupted a plot on the country\u2019s athletes \u2014 a report the Brazilian government has denied.\nBut Nice also seemed to be something of a last-minute wake-up call for Brazil, which immediately announced steps to beef up security. Authorities will now conduct more street searches and establish more restricted areas for vehicles. Terror drills happened in succession: at the airport, a bomb-detonation exercise at a train station, on the water.\nTreinamento da Marinha para as olimp\u00edadas simula o sequestro de uma embarca\u00e7\u00e3o de passageiros, em Niter\u00f3i pic.twitter.com\/5ZTlHxhFfL \u2014 Marinha do Brasil (@marmilbr) July 21, 2016\nThe country just mandated stricter security at airports in mid-July, which caused mass confusion and delays at area airports.

{{Personally, less viewing was more fun. It was a shame though, to see \"home-cooking\" in the Men's 500m short-track race, where a Canadian judge made a marginal call to disqualify my countryman and elevate his onto the podium.\nIf that's what \"own the podium\" means, the podium's not worth owning. So I'll join England's temporarily pro-American Simon Barnes in sending a somewhat sardonic \"Well done, Canada\" to our neighbors up North. But why wasn't there an English judge available?\nHere at TSE in the past few weeks, we've been riffing on the psychological impact of athletic competition. At the Montreal Gazette, Randy Boswell applies this thinking to his country in \"Historic Olympics a nation-building milestone for Canada: experts.\" Wow. I thought Canada already had a formidable nation?\nOn second thought, perhaps that short track judge has a day job with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. More seriously, Boswell's story does have plenty of quotes from people who are either measuring or somehow attuned to Canadian psychology at the moment.\nMy money though, is on Montreal historian Jack Jedwab who says \"if you ask most Canadians today what they remember about Calgary [ed: site of the 1988 Winter Games], I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be able to tell you a lot.\u201d\nBack stateside, the impeccably named Casey Curlin focuses on the Olympics' impact \"beyond Vancouver:\" everything from a boom in orthodontics in Korea to the fallout in Russia from a disappointing haul of medals.\n\"The headlines in Russia were brutal, 'Red Machine Crashes into Maple Tree,' 'Nightmare in Vancouver',\" states Curlin. What strikes me as interesting in this case is that perceived Olympic failure is tied directly to Russia's Sports Minister, with the political opposition calling for President Medvedev to take action.\nIn contrast, the U.S. went into these games with an Olympic organization that was universally disliked and apparently dysfunctional, yet somehow American athletes won more medals than ever.\nHooray for decentralization!! I'm glad that the U.S. doesn't have a Sports Minister. But I doubt that Medvedev would consider abolishing the Russian office, even for a moment.\nAdd\/view comments on this post.\n------------------\nThe Christian Science Monitor has assembled a diverse group of the best economy-related bloggers out there.

{{Tom must breach the Great Wall: China's Bo stands in the way of Daley's bid for diving glory after scraping through qualifiers\nYou wouldn't blame Tom Daley if, before he headed to the Aquatics Centre on Saturday for the semi-final and final of the 10m platform, he took a few minutes to relax, close his eyes and remind himself that the impossible is possible.\nHe could recall the 2009 World Diving Championships in Rome, for example. Going into the sixth and final dive, a then 15-year-old Daley trailed Chinese pair Qiu Bo and Zhou Luxin.\nBut then the unthinkable happened - the Chinese cracked, Luxin slightly off with his timing and Bo's entry so bad that he was given 79 points by the judges, 21 fewer than Daley.\nIn with a shout? Tom Daley will compete in the 10m platform diving semi-final and final on Saturday\nThe teenager from Plymouth became world champion. Now he needs hot favourite Bo to buckle under the pressure again in the 10m platform.\n'If you hold your nerve and dive well and consistently then you are going to do well,' says Daley, whose preliminary round was last night.\n'If you start worrying about what anyone else is doing and you start looking at other people, watching them, seeing what they are doing, then that is when it can start going wrong.\n'Different divers handle pressure in different ways. I quite like pressure and it gives me that extra adrenaline and will to do it, but then the Chinese have been known not to do so well under pressure.\n'The problem is that they are normally so far ahead by the time it gets pressurised. If you keep on their tail then that is when they start feeling pressure, like Rome 2009.\n'On the last dive I scored 10s and Bo dived after me and didn't do his dive very well.\nGood enough? Daley will need to beat the impressive Qiu Bo if he is to take the gold\n'But you just don't know. All divers feel pressure. I feel pressure, the Germans feel pressure, the Americans.'\nDaley's form suggests he should be able to put Bo - who, at 19, is a year older than the Englishman - under pressure.\nIn the four FINA World Series meetings this year, the Plymouth teenager has finished second three times and first once.\nBo beat Daley in two of the four at which he turned up but this is the Olympics and the pressure will be on, especially as China have won six of the seven diving gold medals so far.\nBeing world and junior Olympic champion and the winner of the test event earlier this year only adds to the expectation.\nEven staying close to Bo and claiming a medal would be deemed a great achievement when you consider their different training regimes, something Daley addressed earlier this year.\nAnd that is before you take into consideration Daley's agony at losing his father, Rob, to a brain tumour last year.\n'Qiu is like a robot,' said Daley. 'I train five hours a day, six days a week, which is a lot.\nMan to beat: 19-yearr-old Bo is technically outstanding, and Daley knows he must be top of his game if he is to beat him\nHe has been the past few months, though, and will have struggled to do anything else since last week's agonising fourth-place finish in the synchro event with Pete Waterfield.\nHe is armed with an improved front four-and-a-half-somersault dive, the hardest there is and one he hopes will put him on the podium.\n'The crucial thing is the front four-and-ahalf,' he added. 'That's No 4 for me in my routine, but for some others it is No 2 or No 3. I am going to keep the dive order I've been doing all year.\n'I am not gong to change it going into the Olympics as it is the first time I have done it. For me it is about going in there making sure I do three solid dives before the four-and-a-half and then the four-and-a-half is the icing on the cake.\n'I am aiming to get over 100 points on it as there aren't many divers that can do it. I've gone over 100 points on it four or five times this year but, if I get above 90, that makes it worth using.\nIt's not all about China: Matthew Mitchum of Australia is also standing in Daley's way\n'This year is the first year I have been comfortable with all my dives in competition.'\nHe will have to dive better than he did last night if he is to achieve that. After five of his six dives in the preliminary round, he was languishing in 16th place with only the top 18 qualifying for today's sem-final.\nAnother man standing between Daley and a medal is the current Olympic champion, Matthew Mitcham.\nThe Australian deserved huge praise for keeping the Chinese off the top of the podium in the event at their home Games in Beijing four years ago but he has struggled since.\nInjuries have meant he has not made as much impact on the diving circuit as he would have wanted since 2008.\nHe is certainly determined to be noticed, though, criticising Daley for doing too much media work earlier this year, scaling the giant Olympic rings outside the Athletes' Village a few days before the Games and promising to dive naked off the 10m board if he successfully defends his title.\nDaley's ever-increasing teenage fan base will be hoping he makes the same promise.\n}}

{{International Olympic Committee threatens legal action against ICANN over new TLDs.\nIn a sternly worded letter to ICANN (here), International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it reserves the right to \u201ctake action against ICANN for damages resulting to the IOC or the Olympic Movement from the implementation of the gTLD proposal.\u201d\nIOC is concerned about the time and expense of protecting its brand as ICANN rolls out new top level domain names, such as .web.\nThat IOC is threatening legal action shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise. In my comments to ICANN I noted:\nI am very concerned that this process will open up ICANN to a wave of lawsuits, frivolous or not, that may undermine the organization. From a risk management perspective, this could put the entire internet at risk.\nBut what\u2019s also interesting about this is yet another organization is stepping up and requesting special status with ICANN. IOC\u2019s letter is full of statements that its trademarks have special status and are more important than corporate interests. The organization even goes so far as to suggest that ICANN should reserve its trademarks in domain names, similar to what ICANN currently does with some of its common marks.\nWe\u2019ve seen the Pope ask for special considerations of religious top level domains. Nations and cities think they should get special rights to their location names. Everyone thinks they\u2019re special. If you give these groups even an inch then you open up the floodgates.\nI\u2019m beginning to realize ICANN CEO Paul Twomey is one smart guy.

{{COLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Russ and Kara Winger went on a business trip to Costa Rica last week hoping to seal a deal that would let him accompany her on a trip this month to Beijing. In the back of their minds was what could be the ultimate trip for them: competing together a year from now at the Rio Olympics.\nShe is a two-time Olympian and the American-record holder in the javelin, which she set under her maiden name of Patterson in 2010. He is a discus thrower, a graduate of Pine Creek High School who won Colorado Class 4A titles in the discus and shot put in 2003.\nThey began dating June 9, 2007, \u2014 she is quick to recall the date \u2014 and were married last September. After graduating from college they lived and trained at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif., before moving in 2012 to Colorado Springs, where he grew up.\nThey met at a track meet in 2006, but she resisted him for almost a year because they were 2,000 miles apart. She was at Purdue. He was at Idaho.\n\u201cI was really stubborn,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d had long-term relationships before, so I was sending Russ all kinds of mixed signals, but I knew that I really liked him. I just couldn\u2019t admit it to myself yet. I had a pretty bad injury that year, so I was kind of a mess and he was supportive through the whole thing, even though I wasn\u2019t as nice as I should have been. He totally won me over by being a constant presence and just really supportive. He was kind of my knight in shining armor.\u201d\nShe won her sixth U.S. title last month, qualifying her for the world championships Aug. 22-30 in Beijing, where she competed in her first Olympics in 2008 while still at Purdue.\nHe finished second last month at the U.S. championships, which meant he could go with her to the world championships if he also met the world championships\u2019 qualifying standard of 65 meters, about 2 feet farther than what he threw at the U.S. championships.\nHe \u201cchased the standard,\u201d as Olympic athletes call it, ever since. He had until Monday, hence their journey last week to a meet in Costa Rica. He qualified for Beijing, not on distance but by winning the meet, a continental championship involving countries from North America, Central America and the Caribbean.\nBoth of them missed the world championships two years ago because of failing to meet the standard, but she was coming off reconstructive knee surgery. She had blown out the ACL in her left knee at the Olympic trials in 2012 but still competed at the Olympics six weeks later.\n\u201cThere was like 3 pounds of tape on my knee, and then I got a custom DonJoy brace,\u201d Kara said. \u201cI had a red, white and blue brace for the Olympics. Just trying to make it as positive as I could.\u201d\nHampered by the unstable knee on her plant leg, she finished 15th in her heat and did not advance to the finals. She had knee surgery soon after the Olympics.\n\u201cThe day before I threw in London I lost my mind a little bit,\u201d Kara said. \u201cI was really upset and really scared. Every time I threw, even with the tape and the brace, you\u2019re putting so much downward pressure on your leg. The ACL\u2019s job is to keep your femur in place, so when it\u2019s not there it shifts backward. It would happen every single time I threw. It was really scary to try and do that.\u201d\nKara has the third-best throw in the world this year, giving her confidence she can medal at worlds.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of competition this year, so my body\u2019s wearing down a little bit, but there\u2019s enough time between now and then to heal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be with Russ. That\u2019s a big thing for both of us to have that support.\u201d\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com\/johnmeyer\n}}

{{by WorldTribune Staff, January 5, 2018\nNorth Korea on Jan. 5 accepted South Korea\u2019s offers of talks to be held next week in the DMZ truce village of Panmunjom in the first official meeting between delegations from the two Koreas since December 2015.\nPresident Donal Trump \u201cis taking credit for easing tensions that might have resulted from U.S. and South Korean forces staging their annual exercises at the same time the Games were taking place,\u201d WorldTribune.com columnist Donald Kirk noted on Jan. 4.\nIn a tweet, Trump asked rhetorically, \u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North.\u201d Indeed, he added that \u201ctalks are a good thing!\u201d\nThe North\u2019s acceptance of the offer came hours after South Korean President Moon Jae-In and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to defer joint military exercises until after the Winter Olympic Games.\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Jan. 3 that \u201cWe won\u2019t take any of the talks seriously if they don\u2019t do something to ban all nuclear weapons in North Korea.\u201d\nA South Korean Unification Ministry official told AFP that the North faxed a message to Seoul accepting the proposal for talks. Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-Hyun told journalists that the agenda would include the PyeongChang Olympics \u201cand the issue of improving inter-Korean relations.\u201d\nRelated: Trump agrees to cancel exercises during Winter Olympics in major concession to Pyongyang, January 4, 2017\nTrump and Moon said the massive Foal Eagle and Key Resolve joint military drills would be delayed until after the Games, which begin in PyeongChang on Feb. 9.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later said the drills would take place some time after the Paralympics, which end on March 18.\nMattis said the postponement of the war games was for practical rather than political reasons, citing the importance of the Olympics for South Korea\u2019s tourist industry, and added that Washington would not lower pressure on Pyongyang in other areas.\nThe top U.S. commander in Korea, Gen. Vincent Brooks, tempered the optimism surrounding Trump and Moon\u2019s telephone conversation and the postponement of the military exercises, warning, \u201cWe must keep our expectations at the appropriate level.\u201d Yonhap news agency quoted him as remarking in Seoul that U.S. and South Korean forces had to remain on highest alert, ready for anything, \u201ciron clad and razor sharp.\u201d\n\u201cThe North Koreans may also be expected to call for an end to the sanctions as strengthened most recently by the UN Security Council as punishment for the North\u2019s test on Nov. 19 of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead to the U.S.,\u201d Kirk noted.\nKirk continued: \u201cThe concern among U.S. defense officials was that, in the euphoria surrounding the Games, Americans and South Koreans might forget that basically Kim Jong-Un is playing his own game in an effort to undermine the alliance. The widespread view here is that Kim, even if he goes through with North-South talks and participation in the Games, will go back to his generally hostile policy as soon as the Games are done.\u201d\nThe White House described Trump\u2019s decision to postpone the exercises as a mutual decision by Trump and Moon to \u201cdeconflict the Olympics.\u201d The White House House cited the interest of \u201censuring the security of the Games,\u201d meaning that postponement of the exercises \u201cwould mean North Korea would not be tempted to intimidate the South with acts of terrorism or shock episodes along the demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War,\u201d Kirk wrote.\nJust to show it was not really backing down, the White House said Trump and Moon had both agreed on the need for maintaining \u201cmaximum pressure against North Korea.\u201d\n\u201cTrump\u2019s response,\u201d Kirk noted, \u201cof course, was in accord with a script worked out by his top advisory team, including Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. U.S. diplomats with long experience in Korean affairs presumably argued for the need to go along with Moon\u2019s recommendation despite doubts among some military people.\u201d\n\u201cBut what will they think or say if North-South Korea form a unified single team symbolic of the reunification of the two Koreas? There is no doubt they will publicly appear enthusiastic but privately may wonder if such a team would have an adverse effect of the U.S.-Korean alliance. Everything depends, they said, on the outcome of North-South talks in the run-up to the opening of the Games on Feb. 9.\u201d\nSubscribe to Geostrategy-Direct __________ Support Free Press Foundation\nShare This Post!

{{By Pritha Sarkar and Dmitriy Rogovitskiy LONDON\/MOSCOW (Reuters) - When Larisa Latynina became the most decorated Olympian of all time at the 1964 Tokyo Games, having bowed her head 18 times over the course of three Games as medals were slipped around her neck, the Russian gymnast must have enjoyed all the fuss the record created.

Incredibly, Latynina had no idea about her place on the summit of the Olympic totem pole for another 15 years. \"I only knew that I had set this record in 1979. A journalist from Czechoslovakia sent me a cutout from a magazine,\" the 81-year-old great grandmother told Reuters in an interview. \"It was written that Latynina was in first place, in second was the Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi and in third place was the American swimmer Mark Spitz. Up until 1979 I did not even have an idea that I could be a record holder. I really was surprised by this.\" Related Articles Rutgers basketball: RU SERIOUS, REFS?!

Gay TV channel drags in RuPaul Such ignorance in the 21st century, where traditional and social media hype up super-human achievements even before milestones are reached or broken, seems almost unbelievable. But the lack of fanfare around her in 1964 means that Latynina thoroughly enjoyed all the recognition she got, albeit almost half a century belatedly, when American swimmer Michael Phelps broke her record at the 2012 London Games. \"I would have been surprised that in the space of 48 years, no one would be able to overtake my achievement regarding the number of Olympic medals,\" said the 5-foot-3 Russian, who only took up gymnastics after her dreams of being a ballerina were dashed by the sudden closure of her ballet school. \"When the Americans realized that Phelps could win more medals than myself, there was a great deal of attention around me as well. \"Everyone used to be completely relaxed about my achievements, but in 2012 I was even invited with my husband to visit New York. There we met with Phelps and we had some photographs taken. It was nice for me that after 48 years they remembered me,\" she added with a wry smile. Olympic protocol meant fans and photographers were denied that money-shot of seeing Latynina present Phelps with the historic 19th medal even though she was one of 17,500 spectators who cheered on the American as he broke the record at the London Aquatics Center. So why did it took so long to surpass her mark? \"This was not down to my feats but was the due to the inability of those sportsmen who competed after me,\" said Latynina, one of only two women to win back-to-back Olympic all-around titles. \"I think it is great that there are people... who are able to win such a large amount of medals. However, out of the medals that Phelps won, a lot of them were team events,\" she added, referring to the fact that she won 14 of her medals on her own merit. With two children, three grand-children and three great grand-children, Latynina has little time to get bored. She recently tried her hand at being a judge on a reality TV show where Russian celebrities perform dangerous acrobatic stunts but found the process \"rather tiring\". Instead, she is happiest when pottering around the grounds of her dacha located 100 kilometers outside Moscow, where she spends her time \"in the fresh air with flowers and many kinds of plants\", or when she is visiting the gymnastics school set up in her honor in Obninsk. \"In our era we did not have moves named after gymnasts,\" the nine-times Olympic gold medalist said when asked about her lasting legacy in the sport. \"This trend appeared later. However, I am really honored that there is a gymnastics school in Obninsk that is named after me.Around 1,300 gymnasts train there. \"I often go to watch competitions there and get a lot of joy out of watching our youthful athletes compete,\" added Latynina, who will not be in Rio due to her advancing age. \"Three boys from our school have been selected to compete for the Russian junior team. This is the first success of our school.\" (Editing by Ed Osmond)\n}}

{{International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach maintains the Rio Olympics will be \"spectacular\" and a \"great success\" despite a political and economic crisis gripping the host nation.\nBach's comments came after Rio's Olympic chief Carlos Nuzman brushed aside complaints over power failures and other problems revealed during a gymnastics test event.\nPhoto: Photosport\nBrazil President Dilma Rousseff suffered a humiliating loss in a crucial impeachment vote in the lower house of Congress on Sunday.\nShe is almost certain to be forced from office well before the Olympic Games open in Rio on August 5th.\nThe crisis has paralysed the government as it struggles to revive the economy from its worst recession in decades, casting doubt on Brazil's ability to complete preparations for the event in time.\nPhoto: Supplied\/IOC\nA federal prosecutor also told Reuters that a sweeping investigation into corruption in Brazil is targeting more infrastructure projects for the Olympics than previously made public.\nBach, speaking at the assembly of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), called on the IOC to show solidarity with Brazil.\n\"We know the current economic and political situation in Brazil will continue to make final preparations challenging, but I'm convinced, and we are all convinced, that the Olympic Games 2016 will be truly spectacular,\" he said.\n\"The Olympic Games enjoy strong public support from the Brazilian people and the organisers can count on the solidarity of the sporting world.\"\nBach said that staging the Games was a \"team effort\" and that \"the many successful test events which have already taken place are an excellent example of this team work.\"\nPOWER FAILURES\n\"The sport facilities are either completed or about to be finished,\" he said.\n\"We know from other host cities that the final stretch leading to the Olympic Games is always the most challenging.\"\n\"We're all in it together,\" he added. \"If everyone plays their part, I am confident that these games will be a great success.\"\nEarlier, the assembly heard that a gymnastics event being held in Rio this week, partly as a test run for the Games, suffered from power failures, problems with the timing system and power outages when athletes were performing.\nInternational Gymnastics Federation official Ron Froehlich told the assembly that the power outages were potentially a \"serious issue\" and also complained of a lack of sufficient lighting in competition and training halls, which he blamed on funding problems.\nBut Nuzman, in his address to the assembly, said: \"Test events are there to detect problems raised by athletes and national federations.\"\nNuzman also sounded a relaxed note about the political situation.\n\"Until today we have no involvement and no problems with any of the political or economical situations in the country,\" said Nuzman, head of the Rio organising committee.\n\"We are not involved in this and the Games will run normally as they have until today. We don't expect any problems in delivering the Games.\"\n\"I have no doubt we will deliver an incredible Games but it is important to remember the situation is completely different today,\" he said.\nBrazil was awarded the Olympics in 2009 when it was enjoying a period of strong economic growth but has since fallen into its worst recession in decades.

{{LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 American sprinters who were stripped of their 2000 Olympics relay medals because teammate Marion Jones was doping won an appeal Friday to have them restored.\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in favor of the women, who had appealed the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to disqualify them from the Sydney Games.\nThe court said that rules in place in 2000 did not allow entire teams to be disqualified because of doping by one athlete.\nIn Sydney, Jearl Miles-Clark, Monique Hennagan, LaTasha Colander Clark and Andrea Anderson were part of the squad that won gold in the 4x400 relay. Chryste Gaines, Torri Edwards, Nanceen Perry and Passion Richardson were on the 4x100 bronze medal squad.\nAll but Perry joined the appeal. In 2007, Jones admitted she was doping in Sydney and also lost her individual golds in the 100 and 200 meters and bronze in the long jump.\n\u201cThe panel found that at the time of the Sydney Olympic Games there was no express IOC or IAAF rule in force that clearly allowed the IOC to annul the relay team results if one team member was found to have committed a doping offense,\u201d CAS said.\nThe CAS panel of three lawyers acknowledged that the ruling might be unfair to relay teams that competed \u201cwith no doped athletes helping their performance,\u201d but the decision \u201cexclusively depends on the rules enacted or not enacted by the IOC and the IAAF at the time of the Sydney Olympic Games.\u201d\nThe IOC has now lost two rulings at the Court of Arbitration for Sport within five weeks involving Olympic medals stripped in doping cases.\nSubscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nBelarus hammer throwers Vadim Devyatovskiy and Ivan Tsikhan won their appeals against disqualification from the 2008 Beijing Games and regained their silver and bronze medals, respectively.\n}}

{{JEONGSEON, South Korea >> Lindsey Vonn cast a quick glance toward the sky after finishing what was likely her final Olympic downhill run, shrugged her shoulders after seeing her time and shook a friendly index finger at her good friend.\nNo one could catch Sofia Goggia of Italy.\nGoggia won the women\u2019s downhill Wednesday at Jeongseon Alpine Center and Vonn earned bronze. The American was looking at a higher finish before Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway turned in a surprise silver-medal performance as the 19th racer on the course.\nThen again, shocking finishes seem to be the norm on this hill. Ester Ledecka of Czech Republic made a late charge last week from back in the pack to take the super-G title. She skipped the downhill to step back into the snowboarding realm and will go through qualifying Thursday in the parallel giant slalom.\nGoggia finished in a time of 1 minute, 39.22 seconds to hold off Mowinckel by 0.09 seconds. Vonn was 0.47 seconds behind Goggia.\n\u201cI gave it all today, skied a great race,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cSofia just skied better than I did.\u201d\nAt 33, Vonn becomes the oldest female medalist in Alpine skiing at the Winter Games. The record was held by Austria\u2019s Michaela Dorfmeister, who was just shy of her 33rd birthday when she won the downhill and the super-G at the 2006 Turin Olympics.\n\u201cI wish I could keep going. I have so much fun. I love what I do,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cMy body just can\u2019t, probably can\u2019t, take another four years.\u201d\nVonn captured the downhill gold at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, but didn\u2019t get a chance to defend it four years later when she sat out the Sochi Games after tearing ligaments in her right knee. In a way, this was her \u201cdefense.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think what\u2019s happened over the last eight years and what I\u2019ve been through to get here, I gave it all and to come away with a medal is a dream come true,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put things into perspective. Of course, I\u2019d have loved a gold medal but, honestly, this is amazing and I\u2019m so proud.\u201d\nThis particular track suits Goggia\u2019s aggressive skiing. She also edged Vonn in March to win the only World Cup downhill contested on the hill.\nMaybe mind games. Maybe a ploy. But each pointed to the other as the one to watch in the days leading up to the race. Goggia referred to Vonn as \u201cdefinitely the favorite.\u201d\nGoggia was behind at the top, but found another speed near the bottom. Vonn couldn\u2019t match it when she raced two spots later.\nThis was Goggia\u2019s first gold at an Olympics or a world championships. She has four World Cup wins \u2014 two of them at this venue.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t realize I\u2019m first,\u201d Goggia said. \u201cI was really focused. I moved like a Samurai. Usually, I\u2019m really chaotic but I wanted to take in every little detail, every particular in the morning. I believed in myself \u2014 and then what counts, counts.\u201d\nGoggia and Vonn have struck up a friend over the years, with Goggia recently visiting Vonn at her home in Colorado. They bonded over their love of dogs \u2014 and ski racing.\n\u201cLindsey is a great skier, the greatest skier, a great person and a great woman,\u201d Goggia said. \u201cIt\u2019s always an honor to take part in the same race as her. It\u2019s fun, too. Afterward, we\u2019re friends. We\u2019ll go for a coffee together, talk about our work. It\u2019s good for our sport.\u201d\nVonn has dedicated these Olympics to her grandfather , Don Kildow, who died in November. She wears his initials \u201cDK\u201d on the side of her helmet as a tribute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard for me not to get emotional for so many reasons, especially because of my grandfather,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI wanted to win so much because of him, but I still think I made him proud.\u201d\nMikaela Shiffrin didn\u2019t race downhill because of the altered Olympic program. When the Alpine combined was moved a day forward to Thursday, Shiffrin elected to skip the downhill race rather than compete in back-to-back days.\nSo now Shiffrin and Vonn will meet for the first time in an Olympics race during the last individual women\u2019s event. The combined adds the times of a downhill \u2014 advantage, Vonn \u2014 and one run of slalom \u2014 big advantage, Shiffrin.\nBoth are not planning to participate in the team event on Saturday to close out the Alpine skiing program.\nOn her Twitter account, Shiffrin said: \u201cThis. Track. Is. So. Fun! Only slightly bummed I\u2019m not skiing it today cause we have 4 girls who are ready to hammer down and I can\u2019t wait to watch!\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a memorable Olympics for Mowinckel, who also finished with the silver medal in the giant slalom.\nAmerican Alice McKennis finished fifth.\n}}

{{VANCOUVER--Microsoft Business Division President Stephen Elop looked up as he delivered a presentation to his top managers on Microsoft's campus on Wednesday.\nAs Elop had been speaking, one of those managers, Kirill Tatarinov, had groaned several times.\nIna Fried\/CNET\n\"Was it something I said,\" Elop asked Tatarinov, who runs a division that creates business software for midsize companies.\nSheepishly, Tatarinov confessed that he had been watching the Russia-Canada Olympic hockey game. If Tatarinov worked for some other bosses at Microsoft, that could have been what is known in Redmond as a \"career limiting move.\" Luckily, Tatarinov works for Elop, himself a huge hockey fan.\n\"I respected his choice of priorities,\" Elop told me. \"He didn't take a ding on it at all.\"\nPlus, it was hard to be too mad. Each groan meant that Elop's beloved Canadian hockey team was winning.\n\"I was more pleased that Canada was winning,\" Elop said.\nElop even managed to wrap the meeting up a bit early so that he, Tatarinov, and the rest of the team could catch the action at the nearby Spitfire Grill. When the Russians finally pulled their goaltender after the deficit grew to 6-1, Elop lovingly put his arm around Tatarinov.\nAnd being the hockey fan that he is, Elop, of course, found his way to Vancouver. In a bold move of his own, Elop showed up to the USA House on Thursday, hours before the gold medal game, decked out in his Team Canada jersey, getting quite a bit of ribbing from those at the U.S. Olympic Committee-run pavilion.\nPart of the visit, Elop said was business. In a brief meeting Thursday before he headed to watch the gold medal women's hockey game between Canada and the U.S., Elop noted that he is Microsoft's executive sponsor for Bell Canada--a major telecommunications customer for Microsoft and a sponsor of the Games. But, he agreed a big part of the trip was also about hockey.\nIn addition to that women's hockey game (the outcome of which means I now owe Elop a beer), the Microsoft executive also plans to attend both the bronze and gold medal men's games.\nWe did spend a minute or two talking shop. I pressed him on rumors I keep hearing that Microsoft is working on a version of Office (or some Office applications) for the iPad and iPhone, but Elop slipped the check with a flat no comment.\nHe did assure me that those reading Microsoft's move with Windows Phone 7 Series as a move away from the enterprise are misunderstanding. While the new interface is designed to appeal to consumers more than other versions of Windows Mobile, he assured me his unit is investing more in software for Windows phones than ever before. \"The business division is more involved than ever before,\" he said.\nA quick recharge\nOne of the coolest gadgets I've run across in Vancouver is the rapid battery-charging machine from Samsung. The company has them stationed at venues across the city. The units, which are free to use at the Games, allow many different types of cell phone batteries to be charged in 20 minutes or less.\nIna Fried\/CNET\nAccording to Samsung, the chargers use a processor that detects the battery voltage and applies the same or slightly higher voltage to increase the rate of charge, allowing for a process that normally takes a few hours to be done in a matter of minutes.\nThe Korean electronics giant--and big-time Olympic partner-- has installed a total of 67 charging stations for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, in hotels, press rooms, athlete's villages, competition venues, and other locales.\nTo use the machine, you need only make sure your battery works--it has to do with where on the battery the conduits are located. Then choose a three-digit pin to secure your battery, pop in the battery, and come back 20 minutes later to find your once-depleted battery ready for more action. The stations came in particularly handy for me on Tuesday as I spent the morning covering hockey and then shifted to an evening of writing about figure skating.\nSkating at the bar\nOne of the cool things about the Vancouver Olympics is practically every restaurant or bar in town is a mini-venue with a contingent of fans as passionate as any lucky enough to have tickets.\nSuch was the case with Thursday's ladies figure skating finals. I found myself at Character's--a bar and restaurant on Davie Street.\nAt one table, a group of Koreans cheered on Yu-Na Kim, a national hero and the points leader after the short program. One table over, a group of Canadians clapped for Joannie Rochette, their countrywoman who was skating just days after her mother's death.\nThe Koreans also cheered for Rochette. \"We know about her story,\" said Seung Yu, who studies English in Vancouver. Yu and her friends wanted Rochette to get a medal too--just not the gold.\nIn the end, all were happy, with Rochette getting bronze and Kim, the gold.\n\"It's quite a heroic performance,\" Toronto's Dan Fernandes said of Rochette. \"A bronze medal means more than a gold (under other circumstances).\"\nLauren Karst, of Bowen Island, British Columbia, said she was also happy because Canada now has 17 medals, equal to its mark for the Torino games, with the country also assured of a medal in curling. \"'Own the Podium' worked,\" she said, referring to the national effort to do better on home turf in this year's medal standings.\nMore from Vancouver?\nAs always, if you want even more on the Olympics, please check out the companion blog I am doing for CBSSports.com.\n}}

{{By Andrew Osborn and Denis Dyomkin MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said a shadowy political plot had succeeded in unfairly stripping some Russian sportspeople of the right to compete at the Rio Olympics over doping allegations and promised to defend Russia's tarnished sporting reputation. Addressing members of Russia's Olympic team in the Kremlin on Wednesday, Putin said a decision by global sporting organizations to ban Russian track-and-field athletes and sportspeople in everything from swimming to rowing flew in the face of common sense and legality.

But his tactic of pinning the blame on a shadowy plot, which he has previously suggested emanates in the West, taps into voters' patriotism and analysts say the imbroglio is unlikely to hurt his stratospheric ratings. Related Articles Ke$ha a role model of a different sort Ke$ha talks her beauty routine Rutgers basketball: RU SERIOUS, REFS?! THE RUSSIAN CHARACTER Putin, a keen practitioner of judo and ice hockey, made his comments to over 100 sportspeople, some of whom have been banned from going to the Rio Games next month because of doping allegations by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and other federations. He spoke after the IAAF said there were \"no grounds for further review\" of its original decision. Occasionally looking glassy-eyed and emotional, Putin complained that many of those prevented from going had not been served with specific or proven doping accusations. \"It is obvious that the absence of Russian sportspeople -- leaders in many sporting disciplines -- will significantly affect the intensity of the competition and diminish the spectator value of the forthcoming events,\" said Putin. Any medal won in Rio in the absence of Russian athletes would be worth much less than usual, he added, predicting many victories would be hollow. Pledging tough action against any sportspeople guilty of doping as well as the creation of a system to prevent the practice, Putin said someone was trying to rewrite the Olympics' founding principles -- of equality, fairness and mutual respect. The atmosphere at the meeting, held in a glittering hall in the Kremlin, was somber. Double Olympic champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, one of the athletes unable to attend Rio because of the scandal, became emotional when she spoke after Putin, saying her Olympic dream and that of others had been stolen. Putin said Russians excelled in the face of adversity. \"There is an important and wonderful quality about the Russian character,\" said Putin. \"Difficulties only unite us and make us stronger.\" (Additional reporting by Dmitry Solovyov and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Richard Balmforth)\n}}

{{Three-time Olympian Kristina Groves reached the pinnacle of her sport, long-track speed skating, by winning four Olympic medals.\nGroves won two silver medals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, claiming silver in both the 1,500 metres and team pursuit. She ended her Olympic career at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics with two more medals, once again collecting a silver in the 1,500 metres along with a bronze in the 3,000 metres.\nAfter retiring in 2011, Groves began the long track of transitioning herself into a new life after competitive sport. She dabbled as a TV analyst for CBC, did some public speaking and eventually returned to university to do a master\u2019s degree in sustainable energy development.\nShe continues to give inspirational speeches. She will tell her story, and more, at the annual Huskies\u2019 Raise-a-Paw women\u2019s basketball brunch Sunday morning at TCU Place.\nThe StarPhoenix caught up with Groves \u2014 a mother of a 1-year-old daughter \u2014 earlier this week.\nQ: How tough was it making the transition from competitive sport to the general workforce?\nA: You know what? It was actually quite hard. I juggled a lot the first year after I retired. I started doing the broadcasts for CBC as the analyst for speed skating and still doing a bit of public speaking and that sort of thing. I enjoyed my freedom but, after a while, I started to feel like I needed to move on and do some new things. I was working with a sports psychologist at the time who suggested going back to school, and I thought he was crazy. But I came across a program that really piqued my curiosity \u2014it was actually nothing to do with my background \u2014 (and) I started a master\u2019s program in sustainable energy development. I graduated (last) Thursday. I\u2019m really excited about that. That was kind of a long process. In the meantime, I had a baby in August of last year.\nQ: What was it like going back to university?\nA: When I went back to school, it gave me that direction again, which was awesome because I felt that, when I left competitive skating, I kind of lost that. When I started school again, I had that direction and goals. I had a baby, so that makes everything go crazy. It took about a year longer to finish my degree than I had planned but I just finished.\nI\u2019m looking for the next challenge. I\u2019m back out, trying to network. I don\u2019t really want to work full-time because I want to be at home with my little girl (Maisie). It\u2019s really hard because you spend your whole life doing one thing. I\u2019m 38, but I\u2019m looking for a job and trying to get my foot in the door with little work experience. It can be challenging, for sure.\nQ: How much do you miss the competition, the competitive element?\nA: We were at a World Cup event in Calgary this past weekend, watching, and one of my old teammates was there and I was like, \u2018you know, I don\u2019t miss the racing so much but I miss the feeling of skating, just the physical sensation of skating.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018oh, I miss racing.\u2019\nHe made me think about it. The rush was pretty awesome, especially when you had a good race. You almost forget what it was like. I do have one experience, since I quit, that reminded me how much I do love racing \u2014 I started rowing. I didn\u2019t do it that last two summers because I was pregnant and then I had Maisie this last year, but I started rowing for fun because we did it for team pursuit skating training and I really loved it.\nI just joined the rec program in Calgary and I did one race with another girl in the fall a couple years ago. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve done since I quit skating. It was, like, \u2018oh, that was a good rush.\u2019 I still have it there. It\u2019s just a little dormant.\nRaise-a-Paw Huskies women\u2019s basketball scholarship brunch 10 a.m., Sunday, TCU Place Tickets may be purchased online at huskies.usask.ca\nQ: There are many talented athletes out there. What, in your mind, is the key to success at the elite level?\nA: One, I really loved skating. I loved doing it. It was just really fun, right from when I was a little kid until when I quit. The other thing for me, it was just constantly striving to improve. Every day, I wanted to be better. It wasn\u2019t every day going to the rink and saying, \u2018I want to be the best in the world today.\u2019 It was, \u2018I want to improve this one aspect of my technique\u2019 or \u2018I want to lift this much more.\u2019\nI wasn\u2019t obsessed with numbers or goals or anything. It was just this underlying desire to be better.\nThe last thing would be, I was just incredibly patient. It took me a really long time to get good, which is different than it is for a lot of athletes. Some people get good when they\u2019re young and they have to learn how to maintain it. For me, it was a really smooth, steady progression and that was just my path. I was just going to work with the path that I was on.\nQ: You\u2019ve been an elite athlete and you\u2019ve studied at university. How much admiration do you have for the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) athletes, like the ones on the University of Saskatchewan women\u2019s basketball team?\nA: It\u2019s hard. I did it myself. I did my undergrad in kinesiology at U of C, trying to combine (academics and athletics) and it took me nine years to finish my degree. I can appreciate how hard it is to combine the two, but, at the same time, when I was in school and skating, I had the best time-management ever.\nI stayed in school because I knew I needed balance in my life. Every once in a while, I would skip a semester or, in an Olympic year, take a few semesters off but that was over the course of my life. I think it\u2019s incredibly important to pursue both because, when you\u2019re done being an athlete, whether it\u2019s CIS or in another sport, you need to have something else there. I quit when I was 34 and I had a degree. I had teammates who quit when they were 35 and had a high school education (and) they\u2019d have to start all over.

{{Updated\nSeveral thousand people are pouring onto the streets of Seoul.\nThey carry posters of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with comical red crosses over this face, sometimes with a bloodied nose.\nProtesters have turned out for months, but this is the last time they will meet before the Games begin so they make this a good one.\nThey are incensed by the South Korean Government's embrace of North Korea in these Winter Games, just days before they begin.\nTo these protesters, this is a Northern propaganda coup, and the South is being taken for a ride.\nThe notion North Korean athletes are marching alongside Southern compatriots under a unified flag at the Opening Ceremony is too much to bear for some.\nJason Kim, one protester, tells me he cannot support these Games that embrace the North while they point ICBMs at the world.\nTo him, South Korea's Games have been hijacked by the North's agenda.\n\"I think it's a very big trick,\" he said.\nAnother demonstrator tells me \"it is only a promotion of Kim Jong-un, so we are truly against these Olympics\".\nThey are overwhelmingly middle-aged or older, and could be written off as old-time hardliners.\nBut in fact, younger South Koreans have also turned against this Government for its decision, in particular, to launch a joint women's ice-hockey team.\nA recent poll said while four out of five South Koreans agreed with the general principle of involving North Korea, more than 70 per cent are vehemently opposed to the idea of a joint team.\nIn fact, a South Korean fan has complained to the national human rights watchdog that the decision infringes the individual rights of southern athletes.\nGo Myong-Hyun, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said it highlighted a philosophical and cultural divide between generations \u2014 the older generation that valued sacrifice for the greater good, and the younger one that has been brought up on North Korea's nuclear threats and is drawn more towards the non-Korean modern world.\n\"A significant voice within South Korean society believes the current Government is forcing a political mood \u2026 that even though there is a lot of scepticism about North Korea, with its recent history of provocations, that the South Korean Government would like to [overlook] these issues and instead force this atmosphere of inter-Korean bonhomie, which I think many members of the society feel is detached from reality.\"\nOne protester told me \"This is not for the Games. This is not for peace. This is just a political decision\".\n\"I'm very disappointed, very angry about this decision.\"\nBut what choice did South Korea have?\nNone, says Professor Jeong Yoon-soo, a sports issues analyst from Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.\n\"Stuck between the strong power confrontation between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, the South Korean Government has been cornered,\" Professor Jeong said.\n\"Luckily, the Olympics have served as an opportunity to make the North Korean military threat almost disappear over the past two or three months.\"\nProfessor Chung said North Korea's pugnacious posturing hides a parallel intention to re-enter negotiations, and the temporary Olympic intimacy with its neighbour signals that.\nHe believes \"even if it is a gesture, even if it is an act, if it achieves even temporary peace, it is worth it.\"\nAnd Professor Chung, who could probably be classified as an optimistic pessimist in this scenario, said if it achieved more, it would be a spectacular achievement.\n\"If these Olympics become a seed for negotiation or dialogue, they will become an unprecedented peace Olympics.\"\nBoth experts say the North also has much to gain \u2014 its theatrics and warlike rhetoric are a smokescreen for its greater aspiration to be considered an equal counterpart to the US in negotiations.\n\"Both South Korea and North Korea have a lot at stake in the successful outcome of the Games and the success of this unified team,\" Dr Go said.\n\"But let's say that they are not successful, that there is possible conflict within the unified team for instance, and that the unified team doesn't perform well and there is general scepticism among the South Korean public, even with the Olympics \u2026 then I think the South Korean Government would face important questions right after the Olympics.\"\nThe stakes are high all round.

{{NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russian gay rights advocates called for increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2014 winter games in Sochi in light of Russia\u2019s anti-gay laws, telling a gathering on Wednesday that anti-gay violence is increasing.\nNikolai Alexeyev (L, front), the head of a Russian gay rights group and main organizer of gay parades in Moscow, takes part in a rally in front of the Swiss International Air Lines office in Moscow, October 1, 2010. REUTERS\/Denis Sinyakov\nRussia has come under mounting human rights criticism internationally since passing an anti-gay propaganda law earlier this year that opponents contend curtails the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in the country.\nPanelists at a Human Rights Watch-sponsored event at New York\u2019s Empire State Building cited what they said is a disturbing trend in which homophobes lure gay men through online dating sites into videotaped humiliation and beatings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a green light for nationalistic groups to make violence against LGBT people,\u201d Maria Kozlovskaya, a program manager at the Russian LGBT Network, said of the Russian law.\nThe advocates said there is a need to increase pressure against the International Olympic Committee to speak out against the conditions of human rights in the country. The games, the first to be held in Russia since 1980, are scheduled to run February 7 to 23.\nA number of movements supporting Russian LGBT people have recently launched in the United States. Singer Melissa Etheridge and a host of celebrities \u2014 including James Franco, Edward Norton and Madonna \u2014 launched Uprising of Love, an awareness campaign on International Human Rights Day on Tuesday.\nAn LGBT sports group, Athlete Ally, began a movement called Principle 6 \u2014 referring to the Olympic charter provision banning discrimination \u2014 with support from Olympians and professional athletes in the United States. Tennis star Andy Roddick and the National Basketball Association\u2019s first openly gay player, Jason Collins, are among those listed as supporters.\n\u201cWhat is important for us is to not turn this campaign into a campaign against Russia,\u201d said Anastasia Smirnova, coordinator at the Russian LGBT Network. \u201cIt is a campaign for equality. It is a campaign that promotes the idea of human dignity for LGBT people in Russia, but it is not a campaign against the country.\u201d\nEuropean Union Commissioner Viviane Reding said on Tuesday she would not attend the games \u201cas long as minorities are treated the way they are under the current Russian legislation.\u201d\nAttempting to dampen international backlash, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in October that gays would be welcome in Sochi. The International Olympic Committee announced earlier this week that Russia would set up protest zones at the games.

{{Miami-Dade \u2014 The best and the brightest of Miami-Dade\u2019s black high school students gathered for Module I of the 34th annual Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO) last week in Overtown. In the competition dubbed the \u201cOlympics of the Mind,\u201d students competed in the visual arts, performing arts and music composition.\nStudents who win the competition are awarded gold, silver and bronze medals in each category of competition, Arthemon Johnson, president of ACT-SO Miami-Dade said. \u201cThe gold winners will advance to the nationals, but we all honor all of them,\u201d he said.\nOnce the winners are identified, Johnson said, \u201cwe begin a mentoring process within the ACT-SO community or at the university level. We do this to ensure that the student\u2019s project is strong enough to do well at the nationals.\u201d\nMentors are volunteers, Johnson continued. \u201cWho we select depends on the category. We have relationships with experts at universities including (Florida Memorial) and (the University of Miami). The kids and their projects have to be ready and we make sure that they are.\u201d\nThe national finals, where students will gather and compete for monetary awards, will take place July 5-9 in Houston.\nLast year, 23 Miami-Dade ACT-SO medalists qualified to participate at the 2011 national competition where three 11th graders won national medals. About 96 Miami-Dade students over the past 33 years have won the nationals, Johnson said.\nHosted by the NAACP Miami-Dade Branch, the Feb. 11 event took place at Booker T. Washington Senior High School in Overtown. Module II, which includes architecture, science, humanities, business and oratory is scheduled for Feb. 25.\nThe criterion for judging is strict, Johnson said, adding that the students \u201cmust make the numbers. A gold medal requires a score of 95-100, and those numbers have to be met according to the national\u2019s criteria.\u201d\nDuring the nationals, gold medalists win $2,000, silver and bronze winners take home $1,000. Students will also receive laptop computers.\nThere are no scholarships yet, Johnson said, \u201cand we are working on that. We don\u2019t have the budget right now but it is one of our built-in objectives.\u201d\nACT-SO is a national program created in 1978 by the late syndicated columnist and renowned journalist Vernon Jarrett, who Hyacinth Johnson, ACT-SO Miami-Dade assistant chair and wife of Arthemon Johnson, described as \u201cthe black guru of journalism in the United States.\u201d\nJordan, Hyacinth Johnson said, was \u201ctired of our kids thinking that they needed to play sports and that was all they could do to become successful.

{{Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue were given six hours to stew.\nSix hours to be angry. To be depressed. To wonder whether their free dance meltdown at the world championships, which cost them a spot on the podium, was a sign the six long years they had sacrificed to become the best ice dancers in the world would never pay off.\nUltimately, they decided it was.\nSo the American couple attacked their training with a renewed sense of purpose, filing away at their two routines until they were sharp as skate blades. Their sultry samba short dance went from something that often put them in a hole to the definition of joie de vivre. Their free dance to Beth Hart\u2019s \u201cCaught Out in the Rain\u201d showcased intricate step sequences and perfect harmony.\nBy the time they headed to San Jose for nationals, Hubbell and Donohue \u2014 the four-time U.S. bronze medallists \u2014 were ready to spring upon the skating world a memorable performance.\nAnd unlike last year\u2019s world championships, they delivered it with gusto. Their bluesy free dance nearly two weeks ago pushed them past two-time U.S. champions Maia and Alex Shibutani to the top step of the podium, and pushed rivals Madison Chock and Evan Bates to bronze.\nAll three will represent the U.S. at the Pyeongchang Olympics next month. All three are medal contenders.\n\u201cWhat it means to be an athlete and a professional is to very quickly reassess the situation and reset your goals, and decide whether or not it\u2019s all worth it,\u201d Hubbell said. \u201cA moment like worlds last year, where it was really right in front of our face \u2014 that\u2019s what our coaches said after the free dance, \u2018You had the goal of world podium in your hand and you dropped it.\u2019 There was no sugar-coating that.\n\u201cIt was an awful feeling,\u201d she told The Associated Press, during a break from their training with coaches Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon in Montreal. \u201cBut even if the result hadn\u2019t come yet, we knew in our hearts the process was working.\u201d\nHubbell and Donohue had been working toward it since 2011, when they teamed under the tutelage of Pasquale Camerlengo and Anjelika Krylova. And while they admit there was a spark right away, it was their move to Montreal in 2015 that began to unearth their true potential.\nPart of it was Dubreuil and Lauzon, fresh and frank voices suddenly filling their ears. And part of it was training with Canada\u2019s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, and France\u2019s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, two of the top ice dance couples in the world.\nHubbell and Donohue had no choice but to elevate their performance.\n\u201cWe all have a certain level of camaraderie, that level of \u2014 I want to say that connection \u2014 because we\u2019re all working toward the same goal,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing each other. And without Marie and Patch, and those two on the ice, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to where we are.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not as if their story is a come-from-nowhere fairytale, though.\nHubbell and Donohue won the Nebelhorn Trophy their first year together, and captured gold at Four Continents two years later. But for all their success, things never quite worked out when the stage was biggest: four times they won bronze at nationals, and twice they finished fourth.\nEver the bronzemaids, never the brides.\n\u201cLike anything you excel at you have to invest so much time to be fighting to be at the top of the world,\u201d Hubbell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested six years in this partnership, and long before many more years. We moved out of our country. We struggle with finances because we can\u2019t work. We invest a lot of time and energy, and our families as well, in making this possible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to wait,\u201d she said, \u201cfor what you know that you can achieve or what you deserve.\u201d\nThey finally got it on a sheet of ice in California.\nBut after so many years spent chasing gold, Hubbell and Donohue hardly had time to enjoy their national championship. They did a whirlwind media tour, hopped on a plane back to Montreal, and were soon back on the ice, preparing for their first Olympics. Along with the Shibutani siblings and the team of Chock and Bates, the American contingent is hopeful of bringing home at least one ice dance medal.\nBesides, Hubbell and Donohue aren\u2019t going to complain about a quick turnaround, nor are they going to rue having to enjoy their title later. They\u2019ve proven over the past six years they are quite patient.\nQuite persistent, too.\n\u2014\u2014\nMore AP Olympic coverage: https:\/\/wintergames.ap.org\n}}

{{VATICAN CITY \u2014 The Vatican launched an official track team Thursday with the aim of competing in international competitions as part of an agreement signed with the Italian Olympic Committee.\nAbout 60 Holy See runners \u2014 Swiss Guards, priests, nuns, pharmacists and even a 62-year-old professor who works in the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Library \u2014 are the first accredited members of Vatican Athletics. It\u2019s the latest iteration of the Holy See\u2019s long-standing promotion of sport as an instrument of dialogue, peace and solidarity.\nBecause of the agreement with CONI, the team is now a part of the Italian track association and is looking to join the International Association of Athletics Federations. It is hoping to compete in international competitions, including the Games of the Small States of Europe \u2014 open to states with fewer than 1 million people \u2014 and the Mediterranean Games.\n\u201cThe dream that we have often had is to see the Holy See flag among the delegations at the opening of the Olympic Games,\u201d said Monsignor Melchor Jose Sanchez de Toca y Alameda, team president and the head of the Vatican\u2019s sports department in the culture ministry.\nBut he said that was neither a short-term nor medium-term goal, and that for now the Vatican was looking to participate in competitions that had cultural or symbolic value.\n\u201cWe might even podium,\u201d he noted.\nVatican pharmacist-runner Michela Ciprietti told a Vatican press conference the aim of the team isn\u2019t exclusively competitive, but rather to \u201cpromote culture and running and launch the message of solidarity and the fight against racism and violence of all types.\u201d\nTeam members wearing matching navy warm-up suits bearing the Holy See\u2019s crossed keys seal attended the launch. Also on hand were two honorary members of the team, migrants who don\u2019t work for the Vatican but are training and competing with the team, as well as a handful of disabled athletes. The Vatican aims to sign similar agreements with the Italian Paralympic committee.\nCONI president Giovanni Malago welcomed the birth of the Vatican team, even though he acknowledged that it might one day deprive Italy of a medal.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get too big,\u201d he told Vatican officials at the launch, recalling how an athlete from another tiny country \u2014 Majlinda Kelmendi \u2014 won Kosovo\u2019s first Olympic medal when she defeated Italian rival Odette Giuffrida in the final of the women\u2019s 52-kilogram judo event at the Rio de Janeiro Games.\nIn recent years, the Vatican has fielded unofficial soccer teams and a cricket team that has helped forge relations with the Anglican church through annual tours in Britain. The track team, however, is the first one to have a legal status in Vatican City and to be an official part of the Italian sporting umbrella, able to compete in nationally and internationally sanctioned events and take advantage of the Italian national coaching, scientific and medical resources.\nWhile St. John Paul II was known for his athleticism \u2014 he was an avid skier \u2014 Pope Francis is more of a fan, a longtime supporter of his beloved San Lorezo soccer team in Argentina.\nVatican Athletics\u2019 first official outing is the Jan. 20 \u201cLa Corsa di Miguel\u201d (Miguel\u2019s Race), a 10-kilometre race in Rome honouring Miguel Sanchez, an Argentine distance runner who was one of the thousands of young people who \u201cdisappeared\u201d during the country\u2019s Dirty War.\nThe choice is significant: Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was a young Jesuit superior in Argentina during the military dictatorship\u2019s crackdown on alleged leftist dissidents.\n}}

{{In telegraph and cable communications to Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Committee, and to William M. Garland, and Brigadier General Charles Sherrill, American members of the International Olympic Committee, the American Jewish Congress yesterday called for an inquiry as to how Dr. Theodor Lewald, German Olympic representative squares his statement that Jews would be permitted to train for and participate in the Olympics with the threat of Dr. Goebbels on May 11, that under no circumstances would Jews be permitted to enjoy equal rights with Germans.\nThe messages were signed by Dr. Stephen S. Wise and Bernard S. Deutsch, who reiterated the demand that the International Olympic Committee investigate conditions in Germany by trusted representatives other than Germans Failing that, they asked the Americans to turn down Germany\u2019s invitation for the Olympics until the American representatives have time to conduct an inquiry of their own. Such an investigation, say the messages, will conclusively prove that the \u201cAryan\u201d paragraph applies to Jews in sports and elsewhere in Germany.\n}}

{{The 2018 Winter Olympics are being held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from February 9, 2018 (2\/9\/18) to February 25, 2018 (2\/25\/18). Sports include figure skating, alpine skiing, bobsledding, curling, snow boarding and ice hockey.\nThe Closing Ceremony is Sunday, February 25, 2018.\nHere's what you need to know:\nWhat: 2018 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\nWhere: Pyeongchang, South Korea\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 25, 2018\nTime: 8-10:30 p.m. Eastern\nTV: NBC\nLivestream: NBC Sports\nWhile hundreds of millions of the world's people get ready to watch the closing ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on Sunday, North Koreans are still waiting to see the first event.\nThe lack of news at home is a stark contrast with how North Korea's made-for-the-cameras delegation at the games, replete with hundreds of cheerleaders and even one of the country's most popular singers, has been a big hit with the South Korean media and some of the hottest Internet clickbait of the entire games.\nNorth Korea's state-run media has never been especially devoted to covering international news events. Their job is more about hailing Kim Jong Un and whatever the ruling regime's latest propaganda message might be. On that front they have stayed true to form: The only reports from Pyeongchang as of Saturday afternoon were about the visit of Kim's younger sister and North Korea's nominal head of state to attend the opening ceremony.\nEven taking into account the North's reluctance to portray South Korea in a positive light, the blackout is a bit mysterious.\nKim Jong Un himself used his annual televised New Year's address to wish for the games' success and announce the North's plan to participate, prompting officials from both Koreas to make a major effort so that Pyongyang could send more than 500 people, including 22 athletes and 21 reporters (none of whose work has been seen).\nThe North's gambit largely worked. Its all-female cheering squad and the singing performances piqued the interest of Olympic fans worldwide, though the athletes, mostly young and inexperienced in international events, won no medals and struggled just to keep up.\n\"North Korean athletes are competing on the world stage, even if they're not winning,\" said Martyn Williams, a North Korea media watcher and creator of the North Korea Tech website. \"So the lack of a mention is mystifying.\"\nWilliams said North Korea broadcast coverage of every Olympics going back to the 2004 Athens Summer Games, missing only the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. He said there may have been more, but that's as far as he is able to confirm.\nPrevious Olympics generally got occasional reports, with a focus on the achievements of North Korean athletes, one or two days after the actual competition.\nThis time around, Williams said he has yet to see a \"single second\" of Olympics coverage on KCTV, the primary broadcaster.\n\"Last weekend's 'International Sports News' program featured a cycle race from Dubai, European basketball and European football, but no Olympics,\" he noted. \"In the evening news each evening, the Olympics have not been mentioned except in the context of the North Korean party delegation attending events. Even then, no video has been broadcast. It's been covered with still images.\"\nThe absence of video might suggest a rights' issue -- which is a legalistic can of worms.\nTwo people involved with Olympic broadcast rights for the SBS network, initially the official rights holder for the whole peninsula, said their network returned rights for the North to broadcast the games directly to the International Olympic Committee, but were not sure if Pyongyang had requested permission to use them. Previously, the North would have gone through the non-profit Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, but concerns over possible sanctions violations might have made the IOC route more feasible.\nEven so, broadcast rights restrict only video and reporting done within IOC-designated venues. Reports from \"outside the rings\" are fair game.\nThe country's newspapers and its state-run news agency, KCNA, have also steered clear of the games, though written stories and still photographs are not subject to the same restrictions as television. KCNA's top stories Saturday afternoon were -- typically -- a report about the anniversary of Kim Jong Il's birth being observed last month in Russia, Mongolia and Guinea, and another about Kim Jong Un's work being posted on an African website.\nWith no one commenting in public, it's hard to say anything definitively what Pyongyang is thinking.\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)\n}}

{{MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday it would ask the world athletics body to allow its athletes to compete under an Olympic banner rather than the Russian flag to circumvent a ban, but the idea was quickly brushed aside by the International Olympic Committee.\nActing president of the Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) Vadim Zelichenok speaks during a meeting with journalists at his office in Moscow, Russia, November 10, 2015. REUTERS\/Maxim Shemetov\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended the Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) on Friday following allegations of widespread and state-sponsored doping.\nRussia has since announced a three-month road map to clean up its act, with the nation\u2019s Olympic Committee leading efforts to ensure honest athletes can compete at the 2016 Olympics.\nSports Minister Vitaly Mutko said his ministry would ask the Russian Olympics Committee (ROC) to apply to the IAAF and the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to request that Russian athletes compete under an ROC flag.\n\u201cI hope the IAAF will consider our application that over the next three months while the membership of the Russian Athletics Federation is suspended, our athletes could compete in international contests under the flag of the ROC, our national Olympic Committee,\u201d he told a news conference.\nSome Russian athletes have already suggested they could compete at the 2016 Olympics as independents under the Olympic flag.\nThe IOC has previously allow independents to compete at Olympic Games in certain cases, such as when an athlete\u2019s home country is in transition or subject to sanctions.\nBut asked on Sunday if Russian athletes could possibly compete under the Olympic flag, IOC President Thomas Bach said: \u201cThis is total speculation, I cannot see this situation occurring at this moment.\u201d\nBach said on Saturday that he was sure clean Russian athletes would compete at the 2016 Games. The first competition to be affected by the ban will be the European cross-country championships in France in December.\nThe IAAF said priority for both the governing body and Russia was to make ARAF \u201ccompliant with the IAAF\u201d.\n\u201cOur job right now is to focus on the work that needs to be done to make ARAF compliant with the IAAF and, together with WADA, compliant for re-entry into international competition,\u201d the IAAF said in a statement.\n\u201cEveryone within the IAAF will work tirelessly with authorities in Russia on the reinstatement of ARAF as soon as possible as this is the best outcome for the athletes. This is the first and only priority right now for the IAAF and for Russia.\u201d\nMutko spoke after attending an extraordinary meeting of the board of the Russian Athletics Federation.\nARAF\u2019s acting head, Vadim Zelichenok, told the news conference he hoped Russia would be restored in the IAAF within three months.\nMeanwhile, a new committee would work closely with the IAAF to address the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s (WADA) allegations that led to the ban, he said.\nZelichenok also said ARAF\u2019s board would hold early elections on Jan. 16 for a new president and vice presidents.\nDIVERT ATTENTION\nZelichenok said earlier on Sunday that the IAAF was punishing Russia to divert attention from its own failings.\n\u201cWe understand that the publication of the second part of the WADA report will deal a serious blow to the IAAF. This partially explains such a tough decision with regard to Russia\u2019s Athletics Federation,\u201d Zelichenok was quoted as saying by state-run newswire R-Sport agency.\nFormer IAAF president Lamine Diack is being investigated by French police over allegations he received bribes to cover up positive doping tests of Russian athletes.\nThe commission has so far withheld other aspects of the IAAF\u2019s actions regarding Russia as they form part of an investigation by Interpol into international corruption involving officials and athletes.\n}}

{{RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Usain Bolt's only real competition was the clock. He couldn't beat it. Another gold medal isn't such a bad consolation prize.\nThe Jamaican superstar romped in what he says is his last Olympic 200-meter race Thursday night, but finished in 19.78 seconds, more than a half-second short of his own world record \u2014 the one he said he really wanted to break.\n\"I'm always happy for the win, but I wanted a faster time,\" Bolt, who turns 30 on Sunday, told NBC. \"I felt good, but when I came into the straight, my body wouldn't respond to me. So I guess it's just age and all the rounds that's taken toll.\"\nA win is a win, and Bolt has gold medal No. 8, and a third straight 200 victory to go with the same trifecta in the 100. His run for No. 9 comes Friday in the 4x100 relays.\nAll good stuff. But his expression as he crossed the finish line told the real story of this one.\nThe field running far behind him through a thin mist \u2014 Andre de Grasse of Canada finished .24 behind and Christophe Lemaitre of France took bronze \u2014 Bolt was giving every ounce of effort, grimacing as he approached the line.\nHe glanced to his left to check out the clock just before he crossed. The time came up, and when Bolt saw it, he tilted his head back and yelled, stuck his hands wide open as if to say \"Why?\" then tore off the No. 6 sticker that was on his right hip.\nAt least the after-party was great. What's new? With chants of \"Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt\" ringing out across a mostly full stadium, Bolt paraded around the track with his Jamaican flag, reggae music blared in the background, then the once-in-a-lifetime sprinter dropped to his knees and kissed the track before giving his iconic \"To The World\" pose.\nHis record in his favorite race still stands, though, at 19.19. He set it in 2009 at world championships, breaking the mark he'd previously set the year before (19.30) when he burst into the Olympics in Beijing.\nThursday's was an all-out effort \u2014 no hot-dogging allowed \u2014 in the race Bolt has always called his baby. It's the sprint he worked on from the very beginning. His coach wanted him to double in the 400, but that went out the window when he set his first world record in the 100 meters about two months before the Beijing Games.\nSo, the 100 was his hobby, the 200 was his day job, and when he started talking about goals for the Games, he said immortality was the main one. But the 200 record was also something he really, really wanted.\nWhy didn't it happen?\nThere was a hamstring injury that forced him out of his national championship and reshuffled the schedule in the lead-up to the Olympics, though he looked no worse for wear in capturing the 100 four nights earlier.\nThere was the lightest sheen of rain that covered the track, though there has long been debate about whether a bit of moisture can help or hurt with speed.\nThere was the semifinal the night before, when de Grasse quite brazenly made Bolt work all the way to the line to capture a win, which allowed him to race from his favorite lane \u2014 Lane 6 \u2014 in the final.\nThe 21-year-old De Grasse had it coming and he got it. But his silver-medal finish \u2014 .10 ahead of Lemaitre \u2014 goes well with the bronze he took in the 100 and may pronounce him as the next great sprinter once Bolt leaves the scene.\n}}

{{On Sunday, February 18, at 6:05 a.m. ET, the Olympic Bobsled competition\u2014also known as \"bobsleigh\"\u2014kicks off at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\nAt some point in elementary school, you may have celebrated a snow day by going sledding down the biggest hill in your neighborhood. The Olympics take this classic childhood pastime to the next level.\nFor one, the sled is moving insanely fast\u2014around 80 or 90 miles per hour, which is as fast as a car speeding down the highway. Unlike cars, bobsleds don\u2019t have fancy steering wheels; instead, the driver\u2014called the \"pilot\"\u2014typically guides the sleigh using two ropes and gravity.\nGiven this set-up, the occasional crash is inevitable. In the past, professional bobsledders have tragically died on the ice, proving this sport isn't for the casual sledding enthusiast. As USA Today pointed out, many competitions at the Winter Games\u2014Bobsled, Luge, Skeleton, Skiing, and Snowboarding, to name a few\u2014can quickly go from a fun hobby to a serious danger once treacherous weather and high speeds are accounted for.

{{The Summer 2016 Olympics are here, and while some athletes are wondering what shining medal they'll get, others are worrying about what devastating disease they'll contract.\nFor months, scientists and public officials have issued dire safety warnings about Rio's water supply. The city's water is home to a beautifully diverse array of rotaviruses and drug-resistant super bacteria \u2014 and shockingly, it's dangerous for humans to swim in the feces of strangers.\nWho knew?\nTo celebrate the Rio Olympics, below is a short list of some of the diseases athletes could contract by swimming in Rio waters, or simply walking around the city. An investigation conducted by The Associated Press last year found that Rio waters were home to disease-causing bacteria at 1.7 million times the level of what would be considered hazardous at a Southern California beach. Even athletes who manage to stay above ground are at elevated risk for becoming a victim of a crime.\nLet the games (and the gas) begin!\n1. Adenoviruses\nWaterborne adenoviruses can cause gastroenteritis, an infection which irritates the stomach and intestine and causes truly magical amounts of diarrhea amongst sufferers.\nAustralia's polo team actually contracted gastroenteritis even before they made it to Rio while training in Rome. Upon arriving in Brazil, they were quarantined in the Olympics' media village, not the athletes villages, so that they wouldn't get anyone important sick (just dorky journalists, who probably deserved it anyway).\nOnce the team is back in Rio's waters, they will be at increased risk for contracting the popular illness yet again.\n2. The flu\nIt's peak flu season in Brazil \u2014 and some scientists are predicting that the common illness will affect more people than its popular alternative, Zika. While most athletes who are in good health will survive the illness, the disease can have terrifying complications for people whose immune systems are already compromised.\nLet's hope Rio's public bathrooms are prepared to handle all of the (potential) excess sewage.\nHooray!\n3. Food poisoning\nAccording to the WHO, gastrointestinal infections are common in Brazil \u2014 and travelers should always make sure their food has been \"thoroughly cooked\" and remains \"steaming hot.\" Travelers are further advised to only drink bottled water, assuming that they don't want to stink up the hotel bathroom and spend their entire trip lying and crying on a cold tile floor.\n4. Zika\nThe seasonal flu appears to be more likely to affect Olympians than the Zika virus, but athletes should still take caution. Brazil was the country hit hardest by the epidemic. And while the number of new cases has sharply declined, WHO is still advising athletes to take caution in mosquito-infested areas and practice safe sex.\n5. Dengue fever\nDengue fever may not have malaria's brand recognition, but this mosquito-borne illness is still terrifying. Symptoms include a high fever and diarrhea, and in a rare number of cases, hemorrhagic fever \u2014 causing blood to appear in little dots on the skin and under the skin in large patches.\nThere have been over 1.2 million cases of dengue in Brazil this year \u2014 six times what it was last year at this time. Still, it's winter in Rio, which means that chances are low that many people will contract the fever.\n6. Vibrio infections\nVibrio bacteria live in warm coastal waters, and causes extensive diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Vibrio contaminates some of your favorite undercooked shellfish, including delicious raw oysters. For people whose immune systems are compromised, the consequences can be fatal.\n7. Astrovirus\nWhile not as well known as some of the other viruses, astrovirus, which can be contracted from warm Rio waters, can cause outbreaks of violent diarrhea.\nKey theme here at Rio: terrible diarrhea.\n8. Rotavirus\nThe magic of Rio's waters. Image: renata brito\/ap\nOne of the best known viruses on this list, athletes who compete in the water may come into contact with Rotavirus \u2014 the main cause of gastroentertis globally.\n9. Norovirus\nIf you've ever been on a cruise, there's a decent chance you've been exposed to norovirus, a highly contagious virus spread through food, water and humans. The virus can cause vomiting and guess what \u2014 diarrhea.\n10. Hepatitis A\nThe CDC recommends travelers get a Hepatitis A vaccine before traveling to Brazil.\nWhile many Americans have had the vaccine (except for our precious contigent of anti-vaxxers), Hepatitis A is one the most common waterborne illnesses found in human feces \u2014 and therefore in Rio's waters.\n11. Enterovirus\nSeptember tests at the Naval School race course in Rio were positive for enterovirus, which most commonly causes respiratory illness, obviously causes diarrhea and, less often, inflammations of the brain.\nBest of luck to our athletes! We wish you health, success and lots and lots of toilet paper.\n}}

{{There has been a lot of talk about how London 2012 is the first social media Olympics, but did you notice just how much this concept was embedded into the Opening Ceremony?\n;\nFirst of all, behind every audience member\u2019s seat was a personalised \u2018pixel\u2019 device, which they were asked to utilise and create \u2018user generated content\u2019 in the ceremony itself. Even the official media guide for the opening ceremony says there are no spectators; everyone participates.\n;\nAlso, in the final main section of the ceremony, a social media love story became the backdrop for the spectacle, where a modern day Charlie Chaplin pursued his girl using mobile phones, text messages and social media messaging.\n;\nThe final straw was the presence of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, who appeared at the end of this segment as if he was the architect of the entire modern day society we had just witnessed developing before our eyes.\n;\nEvidently, he was even tweeting from his desk during his appearance within the ceremony, including references to the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Foundation.

{{LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee\u2019s Evaluation Commission got the full Los Angeles experience on Thursday, playing basketball at the Staples Center, hitting Santa Monica beach and negotiating the city\u2019s notorious traffic.\nInternational Olympic Committee Evaluation Commission Chairman Patrick Baumann tours the campus at UCLA that LA 2024 would use as the athletes village in their bid for the Summer 2024 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 11, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\nAfter spending Wednesday indoors hearing presentations from Los Angeles 2024 bid officials, the commission and a media caravan fanned out across the \u2018City of Angels\u2019 for a tour of proposed venues, many of which are already in place.\n\u201cOn the logistics side there were a lot of \u2018WOW\u2019 moments,\u201d Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters. \u201cThe Olympics asked us not to buff the city up.\n\u201cThis is Hollywood. We could have had the best show, the cutest kids lining the streets, we could have had the most amazing fireworks, but we didn\u2019t change a single thing.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t go out of our way to show a city that\u2019s any different than the city we know.\u201d\nThe commission, headed by Swiss Patrick Baumann, got an early start after a glitzy party on Wednesday evening hosted by LA2024 bid chief Casey Wasserman at his home.\nHollywood flexed its celebrity muscle at the party with an A-list lineup that included Sylvester Stallone, Kobe Bryant and billionaire Steve Ballmer, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers and former Microsoft CEO.\n\u2018LEGACY VALUE\u2019\nThe day began with IOC members and bid officials playing a little basketball at the iconic Staples Center and finished under a glorious California sunset at Santa Monica, where the 2024 beach volleyball competition would be staged in the shadow of the iconic pier.\nThere were stops at UCLA, where student residences would be renovated and transformed into an Athletes Village, and the Memorial Coliseum which anchored both the 1932 and 1984 Summer Games and would be a centerpiece again should LA beat out Paris, the only other city in the running, for the 2024 Olympics.\n\u201cToday\u2019s visit underscored one particular point, which is the legacy value of hosting the Games,\u201d said Baumann. \u201cWe saw that the 1984 Games, whether it was venues or people, impacted their lives.\u201d\nThe commission, which was split into three groups, was also treated to a first-hand look at LA\u2019s infamous freeway system and traffic which is one of the major question marks hanging over what LA2024 officials are touting as a \u201cno risk bid\u201d.\nGarcetti has said a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d was underway in a city as well-known for its gridlock as the sun and surf.\nLos Angeles has an extensive metro system already in place and is adding 15 new lines after voters in November passed a measure dedicating $120 billion over the next 40 years to improve public transportation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been able to get a sense of the distances between the various venues and that\u2019s been extremely useful for the commission to feel this, live it,\u201d said Baumann.\n\u201cI would say we did not have any particular traffic issues in any of the three groups.\u201d\nThe commission wraps up the visit on Friday before heading to Paris where that bid will be put under the Olympic microscope. A report will then be distributed to IOC members in July.\n}}

{{The Stampede Corral was built on Calgary\u2019s cowboy fairgrounds in 1950, for $1.25 million. Back when Calgary was home to one-tenth the million-plus people it has now, the Corral\u2019s 6,400 bright-red wooden seats was a grand palace for the city and its minor-hockey Stampeders. It was a bit crowded by the time the NHL Flames arrived in 1980, and the team moved to the Saddledome once it was complete in 1983.\nThree decades later, Flames management have concluded the Saddledome is outmoded and inadequate, and are negotiating a deal with the city for a new arena. And the rickety old Corral? A troupe called the Peking Acrobats will dazzle Stampede-goers with three shows daily in there next month\u2013and at an undetermined date in the future, it will be demolished in favour of extra convention and trade show space. The old building\u2019s no longer up to code, and renovating it is uneconomical, Stampede officials have determined. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive chunk of concrete, and cinder block, and there are no real architectural features that I would call historic,\u201d Stampede CEO Warrant Connell said last year.\nBut somebody believes the musty old barn has a future. There the Corral was, up on the council screen at Calgary City Hall Monday, proposed as the secondary hockey venue for a 2026 Calgary Olympic games.\nThis is typical of the legacy envisioned for a return to Olympic glory for Cowtown: a decade\u2019s delay to the demolition of a postwar venue, and maybe a new coat of red paint on the wooden seats in the meantime. The Calgary Bid Exploration Committee, trying to figure out if a bid makes sense, crafted a $4.6-billion plan for the Games, well lower than the $7 billion price tag for Vancouver 2010.\nHow would they accomplish this? Make do. Vancouver got a new convention centre for its international media centre; Calgary could spruce up the Big Four Building on Stampede grounds, built in 1959. Vancouver got its Canada Line train to the airport and crews widened the road up to Whistler, but the City of Calgary transportation department says the existing road networks and transit system (plus ongoing expansions) will suffice, the bid explorers reported. It helped the committee\u2019s arithmetic that Calgary is already discussing how and when to build a new Flames arena and a massive sports fieldhouse, so neither project was included in the estimate. Affordable housing agencies and private developers would shoulder the cost for apartment blocks for athletes, easy peasy. In all, the city\u2019s advisory panel believes Calgary can host a Winter Games (twice the size of the 1988 Calgary Olympics) with capital costs below $1.2 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this on the cheap \u2026 what\u2019s driving us is realism,\u201d committee chairman Rick Hanson told council. A former police chief, he reckoned that security costs will manage to be lower than Vancouver\u2019s because of venue clustering, fewer terrorism fears, better technology and no coastal port to protect.\nEven with this Discount Games proposal, $4.6 billion is still a massive dollar amount for a city to comprehend, especially one just crawling out of recession. More than half of that, $2.4 billion, would have to come from government coffers, even as both Alberta and Canada are carrying mountains of deficit with no exit strategy. And all this planning and estimating assumes only modest overruns. This is a foreign concept to Olympic Games.\nThe question, however, shouldn\u2019t be how much. It should be: for what? What has emerged on the table for Calgary is a series of intangible benefits laid out in the bid committee\u2019s slide deck: a local artist showcase, mild urban revitalization, entrepreneurial opportunities and better partnership with Indigenous peoples. But as the athletes and dignitaries head home in February 2026, they still won\u2019t have a rail link to Calgary International Airport. Nor will Calgarians, having just spent more on Olympic security than on Games-related transit or community centres or anything else.\nCalgary did benefit temporarily from its turn on the world stage during the Winter Games three decades ago, but 1988\u2019s tourism bump didn\u2019t last\u2014which is often the case when the Games come to town, one Olympics economic benefits study noted last year. Even the economic benefits from the Games and its afterglow wouldn\u2019t be all that amazing: a $2.4-billion government investment would leverage up to $2.6-billion worth of hotel rooms, restaurant visits, large foam cowboy hats and other regional expenditures, the committee says. That\u2019s a $1.10 broad economic benefit for every $1 spent; hardly an argument that will convince anybody, unless they\u2019re in the foam hat business.\nThe memories from 1988 fuelled the Calgary psyche for a while, but one can\u2019t just assume that will be repeated in a more mature city. Calgary gained world-class venues for bobsled and speed skating last time, and that reputation as a winter sports training centre can be amped up only so much more, and perhaps doesn\u2019t really need to be. So what else, Calgary? There is no physical legacy proposed. Are warm fuzzies and renewed international attention worth the cost, the two weeks of traffic congestion and the inevitable AirBnb horror stories?\nHanson\u2019s committee will recommend next month whether or not Calgary should bid for the 2026 Games; after Stockholm pulled out recently and Salt Lake City has remained on the sidelines, its main competition might be Sion, Switzerland, and the Alps haven\u2019t hosted since 2006 in Torino, Italy. The picture may shift next month when the International Olympic Committee, finally wising up to the fact that its general awfulness keeps repelling would-be bidders, proposes new rules for 2026 bids. It\u2019s hard to see how Calgary\u2019s Recycled Games proposal would be appealing to city councillors\u2013including Mayor Naheed Nenshi, who adores the Olympics and feel-good events in general\u2013but perhaps the IOC will sweeten the pot.\nThe international body may also mercifully euthanize Calgary\u2019s ambitions another way: deciding to simultaneously award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics, with attractive bids from both Paris and Los Angeles. Giving consecutive Olympic events to North American cities seems quite unlikely. Sorry, good ol\u2019 Stampede Corral, but you\u2019ve had an okay life.\n}}

{{The 2014 Winter Olympics are about to begin in Sochi, Russia, and astronauts will be watching the games from their vantage point high above Earth on the International Space Station.\nThe space station currently plays host to a crew of six international astronauts and cosmonauts, a unique viewing party for one of the biggest worldwide events of the year. NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio expects that there will be some friendly international competition during the games, especially if the Russians and Americans compete against each other. You can watch the full space sports interview on Space.com, with Mastracchio also touching on the recent Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\"We've got the Japanese astronaut [Kiochi Wakata], we've got three Russian astronauts [Oleg Kotov, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Mikhail Tyurin] and then you have Mike [Hopkins] and I from the United States,\" Mastracchio told Space.com. \"I think there will be some friendly competition especially if the Russian and U.S. hockey teams meet head to head. That would be interesting.\" [Photos: 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and Space Travel]\nNASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio speaks with Space.com from the International Space Station while flanked by two U.S. spacesuits. Image uploaded Jan. 31, 2014. (Image: \u00a9 NASA TV)\nWagering on a win\nWhile there may not be any traditional betting pools on the station, astronauts and cosmonauts could wager their space food as a way to make the stakes a little higher while tracking the Olympics, Mastracchio said. It's also nice to take a break from the usual food provided on the station in favor of something a little more interesting, he added.\n\"When you're up here for such a long time, even though we do have a variety of food, it starts to get a little bit old, so anytime you can get something a little bit different, it's definitely a treat,\" Mastracchio said. \"So, I'm sure the Russians have a lot of good food and there are a lot of things that we have that they enjoy also.\"\nMastracchio and his fellow spaceflyers will likely opt to watch the Sochi Olympics instead of launching their own ad-hoc winter games in orbit.\n\"We don't have much snow up here,\" Mastracchio said. \"The kind of thing we do up here is more like gymnastics when we're floating around and spinning around, you feel like a gymnast or how a gymnast must feel when they're doing those incredible feats.\"\nOlympic torch in space\nAstronauts and cosmonauts on the space station have a special connection to the Olympics this year. The Olympic torch visited the space station late last year. Cosmonauts Kotov and Ryazanskiy took the torch on a spacewalk outside of the orbiting outpost before it flew back down to Earth with another crew.\n\"I think the key phrase is 'international co-operation,'\" Mastracchio said. \"Both the Olympics and the International Space Station are great examples of what folks can do when they get together \u2014 when all these different countries get together \u2014 and try to accomplish something.\"\n\"The Olympics are an incredible event,\" Mastracchio added. \"All these different nations from around the world get together to participate in athletic events. Look at the International Space Station. Again, you've got many countries from around the world building hardware and then we assembled it in orbit and it had to fit together perfectly. International co-operation is the key to being successful in anything.\"\nMastracchio and Hopkins will be able to ask Mission Control to beam up some of their favorite sports on a time delay, and they might even be able to watch some of the sporting events live during downtime on the weekends, Mastracchio said.\n\"I like a lot of the events in the Winter Olympics,\" Mastracchio said. \"The speed skating, and some of the different skiing events are pretty interesting to me. Anything where there's a lot of speed seems a little more interesting.\"\nThe Olympics kick off with the opening ceremony from Sochi on Friday (Feb. 7).\nFollow Miriam Kramer @mirikramer and Google+.

Officers sat on rooftops to raise money and awareness for Special Olympics Wisconsin.\nThe West Milwaukee location had more than a dozen volunteers, including some Special Olympics athletes.\n\u201cIt makes me feel like I don't have a disability, that I have an ability,\u201d said Tyler Derringer, who competes in the Special Olympics.\nLast year the West Milwaukee store raised more than $3,200 - the second highest total in the state. The store's goal this year is to beat their previous total and come in first in Wisconsin. Police at the location are hoping to grab more attention by spending time on top of the building.\n\u201cSometimes they think it might be a crime scene. We want them to know it really isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Chief of Police for West Milwaukee, Dennis Nasci.\nOfficers say they are willing to do whatever it takes to reach their goal, including putting up with a little good-natured teasing.\n\u201cI did have one young lady who wanted to take a picture with me this morning because she thought it was kind of ironic,\u201d said the Chief Nasci. \"Just because cops at a donut shop, they wanted to take a picture of us, but you know, hey, they give us money we'll take a picture.\u201d\nAll money raised will go toward helping the Special Olympics run their programs. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts will contribute $5,000 in addition to whatever is raise by law enforcement agencies throughout the state.\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nIn just a matter of hours we'll all be able to sit down, turn on the OWN network for the first time, and watch Lance Armstrong admit that he doped and cheated to win seven Tour de France titles \u2014 or something like that. (It's only Part One.) And on this special day, loaded with legal ramifications along with ratings and tell-alls, the International Olympic Committee has finally decided to strip the disgraced cyclist of his Olympic bronze medal. \"The timing of the IOC move, however, was not related to the TV interview,\" reports the Associated Press. Which makes you wonder why it took so long to strip him of his medals \u2014 Armstrong took the bronze at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. As the AP notes, the committee was discussing his medal back in December:\nThe IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal.\nThat may seem like a strange timeline since Armstrong was stripped of his cycling titles in October, but it turns out that he was \"formally notified\" on December 6, and did not file an appeal on December 27. Which brings us to today's curious timing, some three weeks later.\nNevertheless, it's just one more wrinkle heading into Oprah Winfrey's already recorded two-night interview, which will also be broadcast online right here starting at 9 p.m. Winfrey claims Armstrong was \"forthcoming,\" although the big reveal might end up being more about how Armstrong says things than what, exactly, Armstrong says. For what it's worth, or if you don't buy Oprah's hype, Armstrong just texted this to the AP:\nI left it all on the table with her and when it airs the people can decide ... I have no idea what the future holds other than me holding my kids\nOf course now that we know we've been lied to, Armstrong's word is worth about the cost of that text message. But the Oprah confession is just the first step to building back public trust, and the interview, which will continue Friday, also has legal ramifications. Armstrong is currently the defendant in at least two pending lawsuits, and a confession could cost him tens of millions of dollars. The AP notes that there's a possibility of a third suit on the way. \"The Justice Department faces a Thursday deadline on whether to join a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title for doping,\" reports the AP.\n}}

Already with the qualifying time, McBride clinched his spot by winning the event at the national championships in Edmonton.\nFavourite food:\n\u201cIndian curry, chicken curry, tikka masala, chicken rogan josh. Anything Indian cuisine. I just like the mixture of flavour in there. It\u2019s amazing and for some reason I can eat rice all day.\u201d\nFavourite artist:\n\u201cDrake, because he\u2019s from Canada and I always want to see a Canadian doing well, and John Mayer. Two completely different style artists and it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nFavourite song:\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite song. There\u2019s too many and I\u2019d feel bad if I chose one. There\u2019s probably 10 that I could choose.\u201d\nFavourite animal:\n\u201cA lion. King of the jungle and gets what he wants.\u201d\nAthlete most admired:\n\u201cDavid Rudisha (Current Olympic champion, world champion and world record holder from Kenya in the 800 metres). Not just because of what he did in my event, but how he carries himself. He\u2019s just very humble.\u201d\nPerson most admired:\n\u201cMy mom, Marquita Borders. She\u2019s very, very strong. We\u2019re extremely close. She\u2019s my mom, mixed together with my best friend. She really got me through a lot when I was down in Mississippi. We were close before I left, but the distance has made us closer.\u201d\nIf you weren\u2019t doing this, what would you be doing:\n\u201cI always wanted to be a lawyer,\u201d said McBride, who is set to start his masters in public administration. \u201cI wanted to go to law school, but law school and running would be tough. I\u2019ll put off law school until I\u2019m finished running.\u201d\nThoughts on Zika virus:\n\u201cI\u2019m just going wear my bug spray. It\u2019s very scary, but I\u2019m only going to focus I want I can control and that\u2019s putting on my bug spray and trying to stay clear of grassy areas and forest areas and focus on my completion.\u201d\nFavourite sport other than your own:\n\u201cBasketball. I\u2019d be a small forward, but like a point guard. A mixture of the two where you can bring the basketball up the court, like a point guard, but still get down there and get rough and tough with the big boys.\u201d\nCareer highlight to date:\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say the first time I won (the NCAA title as a sophomore) just because of the timing. The year before I was hurt and when I won in March, I got out of that slump and proved to myself I can rustle and tussle with the NCAA athletes. It springboarded me.\u201d\nFavourite place in Windsor area:\n\u201cI like the Davis area. Over there by William G. Davis (public school), Rivard (street), the Foutainebleau area just because that\u2019s where I grew up. I often drive through there and I run through there all the time, but when you\u2019re running you can\u2019t really take everything in. There\u2019s just so many memories over there.\u201d\nNOELLE MONTCALM\nSpecialty:\nWomen\u2019s 400-metre hurdles\nCompetition dates:\nPreliminaries are Aug. 15, semifinals are Aug. 16 and the final is Aug. 18.\nRoad to Rio:\nA standout at the University of Windsor, the 28-year-old Montcalm switched from sprint hurdles to the 400-metre hurdles in 2012 and won back-to-back national titles. She represented Canada at the 2013 world championship, but no athlete delivered more with everything on the line than Montcalm. She did not have the Athletics Canada qualifying standard at nationals and needed to hit it and finish on the podium to qualify for the Olympics and did both by winning the event in 55.83.\nFavourite food:\n\u201cProbably pizza. My homemade pizza is my favourite. Usually with peppers, zucchini, chicken or whatever\u2019s leftover in the fridge.\u201d\nFavourite artist:\n\u201cI listen to everything. I can\u2019t pinpoint a favourite artist.\u201d\nFavourite song:\n\u201cI like everything. I don\u2019t really have a favourite because I change moods.\u201d\nFavourite animal:\n\u201cA sea otter. Watching them in the water, they\u2019re just fascinating.\u201d\nAthlete most admired:\n\u201cPerdita Felicien (former Canadian women\u2019s sprint hurdler). I\u2019ve always looked up to her. She\u2019s always been a role model.\u201d\nPerson most admired:\n\u201cAgain, Felicien because she\u2019s done a lot throughout her career. She knows the highs and lows and how to deal with it.\u201d\nIf you weren\u2019t doing this, what would you be doing:\n\u201cProbably be pursuing my career a little bit more as a nurse,\u201d said Montcalm, who works in long-term care nursing.\nThoughts on Zika virus:\n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about it. It\u2019s in the back of my mind. I just have to focus on racing and competing. I can\u2019t worry about that (virus) too much.\u201d\nFavourite sport other than your own:\n\u201cI would say tennis.\u201d\nCareer highlight to date:\n\u201c(This year\u2019s) national championship was huge for me. I went in and everything was on that race. That race meant everything to me. After coming fourth last year and a difficult season and then a difficult start this year, just to win that race in that field meant a lot.\u201d\nFavourite place in Windsor area:\n\u201cJust being home.\u201d\njpparker@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/winstarparker\n}}

{{LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - The World Anti-Doping Agency WADA\nhas issued a revised draft code inserting a proposed Olympic ban\nfor serious doping offenders from January 2015.\nThe revision, if left in the final draft to be approved at a\nworld conference on doping in sport in Johannesburg in November\n2013, would mean athletes whose suspension ends before a Winter\nor Summer Games could be banned for one Olympic cycle.\nThe draft will have a third consultation phase between Dec.\n1 this year and March 1, 2013. The second phase ended on Friday.\nArticle 10.15 of the draft code, published on the WADA\nwebsite (www.wada-ama.org), is in line with an International\nOlympic Committee rule which was outlawed after a Court of\nArbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing last year.\nThat IOC ruling had excluded athletes banned for six months\nor more from the next Olympics.\nThe British Olympic Association (BOA) also lost a recent CAS\nhearing over its controversial by-law imposing a lifetime\nOlympic ban on British athletes failing dope tests.\nThe BOA had argued that the existing two-year sanction was\nan insufficient deterrent.\nThe CAS ruling cleared the way for British athletes with\nprevious convictions, such as sprinter Dwain Chambers and\ncyclist David Millar, to be considered for selection for the\nLondon Olympics starting next month.\nThe revised WADA code says that, in certain circumstances,\nas an additional sanction an athlete \"shall be ineligible to\nparticipate in the next Summer Olympic Games and the next Winter\nOlympic Games taking place after the end of the period of\nineligibility otherwise imposed.\"\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Alison Wildey)\n}}

{{The U.S. and South Korea will go ahead with joint military drills after the Paralympics, both of them confirmed Tuesday, despite the exercises always infuriating Pyongyang and the Olympics having driven a rapprochement on the peninsula.\nWashington previously agreed to a request from Seoul to delay the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises -- which usually begin in late February or early March -- until after the Pyeongchang Games in the South, to try to avoid stoking tensions.\nThe Olympics have since seen a charm offensive by Pyongyang, which dispatched athletes, cheerleaders and its leader's sister Kim Yo Jong to attend the Games.\nShe passed on Kim Jong-un's invitation to the South's President Moon Jae-in to come to a summit in Pyongyang -- which he did not immediately accept, saying the right conditions were needed first.\nAnalysts say the Games-driven bonhomie on the peninsula may not last long once the sporting festivals are over, particularly once Key Resolve, a command post drill, and the Foal Eagle theatre-level field exercise begin.\nThe start date will be announced by the two allies between the end of the Paralympics on March 18 and the beginning of April, Seoul's defense minister, Song Young-moo, was quoted as telling the National Assembly by a ministry spokesman.\nA U.S. Forces Korea spokesman confirmed the position to AFP. \"The date for the postponed exercises -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- will be announced after the Paralympics,\" he said. \"The exercises have been postponed, not scrapped.\"\nGen. Vincent K. Brooks, who commands the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, last week told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee that joint drills are \"essential\" to \"deter North Korean aggression\".\nMilitary tensions often run high during the exercises, with the North carrying out its own counter-drills against what it condemns as rehearsals for a war.\nPyongyang says it needs its nuclear weapons to defend itself against the threat of invasion by the U.S.\nThe North's KCNA news agency on Monday accused the U.S. of seeking to torpedo the reconciliatory mood by resuming the exercises.\n\"Trump and his clique are racketeering to nip peace in the bud that started sprouting on the Korean peninsula,\" KCNA said in a commentary.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has previously said the drills would go ahead after the end of the Paralympics.\n------\nThis article was from Agence France Presse and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

tax-free income of \u00a328,000 a year (worth \u00a337,000) in the form of a grant from UK Sport funded by the National Lottery.\nBut thanks to the Bank of England rules brought in to stop the housing

didn\u2019t want to know\nAnd it\u2019s slightly worse than that.\nTo buy his dream home, a two-bed property costing \u00a3190,000 in Watlington, Oxon, Will is forced to receive help from his 56-year-old teacher mother, who must be named on the loan.\nAs she already owns a property, it means her son has to pay an extra \u00a35,600 in stamp duty as this is deemed a second home.\nHow bloody ridiculous.\nGetty Images 6 Will is forced to receive help from his 56-year-old teacher mother, who must be named on the loan\nI would be grateful if Chancellor Philip Hammond, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and John Howell, the local MP for the Watlington area, get together and accept that these athletes must receive priority for lending.\nThe athletes give up careers \u2014 yes, for themselves, but also to give us a pleasure and a sense of national pride in their performance that money can\u2019t buy.\nThe idea a handful of champions will derail the housing market is

schemes is they are so complicated only accountants could understand them, which is why I hope celebs and innocent former footballers like Steve Staunton (Friday\u2019s column) will go after

{{Emily Overholt returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with a bronze medal, an injured hamstring and the weight of the world on her 19-year-old shoulders.\nShe could handle the medal and everything it represented. In time, her hamstring would heal.\nBut the other thing, this black cloud that wouldn\u2019t let in any light, was different. What do you even call this thing? She didn\u2019t really know. She just knew it was taking away everything she loved and if she didn\u2019t get help, it would never give it back.\n\u201cIt got to the point where I wasn\u2019t safe for myself,\u201d says the star UBC swimmer. \u201cIt took me awhile to accept help and even then I was in denial. I didn\u2019t want to be there (in a hospital getting treatment for depression). It was tough to open up but it was really the only way I was going to get better.\n\u201cI think the biggest thing was just accepting that what I was feeling was real. It was serious and could be treated and I could feel better.\u201d\nIn this line of work we write about concepts such as courage and character; perseverance and resilience. We talk about athletes overcoming obstacles and the life lessons they provide. Then you listen to this young woman tell you what she had, what she lost, and where she is now, and you realize those terms have little meaning.\nOn Wednesday night, the 21-year-old from West Vancouver will be presented with the Harry Jerome Comeback Award by Sport B.C. and that\u2019s a good thing. But it doesn\u2019t begin to tell the story of her journey and her triumph, a journey that will likely take her to the Tokyo Olympics next summer but won\u2019t stop there.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with sharing my story,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it will help people. It was a really hard time in my life, a real struggle, but I definitely learned a lot.\u201d\nIf you get to her Twitter feed, you will see links to a variety of posts and articles on mental health. You\u2019ll also see this from MindHealth B.C.: \u201cI may not be there yet but I\u2019m closer than I was yesterday.\u201d\nNo, the journey never really ends but, sometimes, it gets easier.\nIn another year, Overholt will attempt to qualify for Tokyo in a couple of disciplines. Her best event is the individual medley \u2014 she finished fifth in the 400 IM in Rio \u2014 but she\u2019ll also be in the mix in the relays and freestyle.\nIn Rio, she filled in for an ailing Brittany MacLean in the 4\u00d7200-metre freestyle relay and helped the Canadian team make it to the final, where they eventually claimed bronze. She did all this with an unco-operative hamstring.\nStill, she remembers the Rio Games for other reasons. The first symptoms of depression appeared in the run-up to the Olympics. In its early stages, the illness wasn\u2019t debilitating. She talked to her family \u2014 parents Carman and Deborah \u2014 she talked to her coaches \u2014 Tom Johnson on the national team and Stephen Price at UBC. She powered through it because that\u2019s what she always did.\nBut when she got home from Brazil things got worse. A lot worse. She would eventually be hospitalized for 10 weeks before she was discharged in December 2016.\nIt would be another nine months before she returned to the pool and competition.\n\u201cI had this hamstring injury and it was something I could talk about and people could see it,\u201d she says. \u201cDepression is really hard to talk about. People couldn\u2019t see it. I hid it from everyone. It wasn\u2019t until things really got bad that I asked for help.\u201d\nIt would take time. Depression isn\u2019t a wonky hammy or a strained MCL. There\u2019s no timetable or rehab regimen that makes everything right.\nIn Overholt\u2019s case it was a combination of time, the love of her family, the support of her coaches and teammates, and her own iron will that brought her through to the other side.\n\u201cIt took a long time for me to figure things out,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to go back to swimming. I had to take time for myself.\u201d\n\u201cTo see her arc, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d says Price, who recruited Overholt to UBC out of high school. \u201cIt transcends sports. Physically she\u2019s climbing back up the ladder. And she\u2019s in a much better place as a person. There\u2019s more balance in her life.\u201d\nAs for 2020, well, Overholt knows it\u2019s coming. But, unlike the run-up to Rio, she also knows it\u2019s one day at a time, and if that sounds trite, read her story again.\nToday, she has the pool, her family, friends and her dog. There will be other days when there are bigger challenges \u2014 challenges she\u2019ll be better prepared for \u2014 and they\u2019re coming soon enough.\nBut, until then, she has this day and that\u2019s all she wants or needs.\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m happy with my swimming and where I am with my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s something that\u2019s happened to me and I definitely take better care of myself because of it.\n\u201c(In Rio) it took me a long time to be proud of what I did. I think this time I\u2019ll appreciate it more and I\u2019ll have a different idea of success.\u201d\nShe sees that now, sees that because light broke through that black cloud.\newilles@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/willesonsports\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

{{The teenage high jump phenom lives at home and carpools to practice. Same with the 30-year-old American record-holder in the shot put.\nThese two medal hopefuls at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics also have this in common: A father for a coach whose last name is certainly recognizable to most football fans.\nVashti Cunningham\u2019s dad is longtime NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham, who built a track club in Las Vegas to help his daughter \u2014 and son \u2014 soar to new heights in the high jump. Michelle Carter\u2019s father is Michael Carter, a stalwart defensive lineman who used to routinely drive 340 miles roundtrip to offer her shot put tips.\nAnything for their kids.\nBeing down a touchdown on the football field isn\u2019t nearly as pressure-packed as watching their children from the stands.\n\u201cThe heart is invested,\u201d said Cunningham, a second-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1985 who played 16 seasons for four teams. \u201cWhenever your heart is invested, you\u2019re going through all the emotions.\u201d\nRandall began coaching his daughter and his son, Randall II \u2014 now at Southern California \u2014 when they were just kids. A standout in the high jump in high school, he turned his focus to football at UNLV because the school didn\u2019t have men\u2019s track and field.\nHe\u2019s part mentor, part instructor but most of all, dad.\nAnd dad certainly knows his stuff. Three months ago, 18-year-old Vashti became the youngest woman to win the event at world indoor championships in Portland, Oregon. Soon after, she signed a deal with Nike. Her brother recently won an NCAA high jump title.\n\u201cGood genetics,\u201d said Randall, who coaches a track team in Las Vegas called the Nevada Gazelles. \u201cI put confidence in her to jump (high). She trusts her dad. A lot of people who don\u2019t know the sport and try to coach their kid fail because their kid doesn\u2019t trust them.\u201d\nShe diligently listens, too.\n\u201cWe have a good relationship, because he knows my limits, as far as my father and my coach,\u201d Vashti said. \u201cI can\u2019t go in there and mess up with the knowledge he\u2019s transferred to me.\u201d\nGrowing up, Michelle never really knew her father as Michael Carter the shot putter, only Michael Carter the San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman.\nIt\u2019s not like the silver medal he captured at the 1984 Summer Olympics was hanging around the house or anything.\nIn seventh grade, Michelle expressed a desire to try the shot put. At first, dad was a little hesitant, thinking maybe she was enticed by someone who informed her that he was once a thrower.\nNot the case, she insisted.\n\u201cHe just wanted us to pick it for ourselves,\u201d Michelle explained. \u201cWhen I picked it up, he said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re going to do this, I\u2019m going to teach you how to do this and you\u2019re going to do it right.\u2019\u201d\nMichael worked with her through a record-breaking high school career, and thought his coaching days were done once she went to the University of Texas. But he was asked to help out and so he drove from Dallas to Austin every two weeks to offer some guidance.\nDad certainly knew his shot put, too. Michelle has blossomed into one of the world\u2019s top throwers, winning six U.S. outdoor titles. She also set the American outdoor record of 66 feet, 5 inches (20.24 meters) in 2013 and broke the nation\u2019s indoor mark with a throw of 66-3 3\/4 (20.21) to capture a world title in March.\nUsually not one to show much emotion, Michael bubbled over when he hugged her back stage after her record-setting win.\n\u201cMy daddy is a big, old teddy bear,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re able to share those moments together.\u201d\nThese days, he\u2019s dad, coach and roommate.\nNot too long ago, Michelle tried to buy a house. When it fell through, she moved in with her parents until after the Olympics.\nMichelle and her dad carpool to practice most days, along with their dog named Ryder. While Michelle throws the shot at practice, Michael tosses the ball to Ryder.\nAnd when they get home, they talk shot. They\u2019re always talking about the shot put, even when they say they\u2019re not going to.\nOccupational hazard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for my dad to leave it out of the conversation,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cIt consumes your whole life.\u201d\nJust like football once did \u2014 for Michael and Randall.\nThe two gridiron greats hadn\u2019t seen each other in decades before crossing paths last March at the world indoor. At first, Randall didn\u2019t recognize Micheal until he scrambled to put on his glasses and read the name on the credential of the big man standing in front of him.\nOh yeah, Michael Carter, the San Francisco 49ers Pro Bowler who used to chase Cunningham around the football field.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I see now that you\u2019re old,\u2019\u201d Michael chucked.\nHonest mistake, Cunningham asserted.\n\u201cOf course I remember him \u2014 a great player,\u201d Randall said.\nNow they\u2019re both coaching their daughters, who are both strong contenders for Olympic medals.\n\u201cNo one can teach our child better than we can because of knowledge we had in the beginning,\u201d Michael explained. \u201cIf there was someone to come along and take it beyond where we can take it, that would be fine. So far, haven\u2019t found anybody.\u201d\n}}

{{Media playback is not supported on this device President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, announced the winner to huge cheers from the Tokyo contingent\nTokyo has been chosen to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games ahead of Istanbul and Madrid.\nThe Japanese capital won a final round of voting by International Olympic Committee (IOC) members in Buenos Aires to beat Istanbul by 60 votes to 36.\nMadrid had earlier been eliminated in a first-round ballot.\nAnalysis There were huge scenes of celebration from the Tokyo delegation - it means a huge amount to them. There are always frontrunners and outsiders in any bidding process but what went on here in the last few days and hours proved decisive. Madrid appeared to have the momentum but Tokyo's presentation was wholly impressive.\nThe announcement was met with jubilant scenes in Japan, as Tokyo prepares to host the event for the first time since 1964.\nWhen IOC president Jacques Rogge - who will retire after 12 years in the role on Tuesday - announced the winning city, the Tokyo delegation jumped to their feet in celebration and waved the Japan flag.\nA number of them were overcome with emotion and wept, following two years of intense lobbying.\n\"I would like to thank everyone in the Olympic movement and we will host a wonderful Olympic Games,\" a delighted Prime Minster Shinzo Abe said.\nBid leader Tsunekazu Takeda added: \"It is a great honour that Tokyo has been chosen.

This is a magical moment of celebration to savour before the years of hard work ahead.\"\nTokyo residents greeted the announcement with jubilant scenes at Komazawa Olympic Park\nThe decision means Tokyo - which campaigned with the message that \"the Olympics will be safe in our hands\" - will become the first Asian city to host the Games twice.\nThey were also awarded the event in 1940 but the Games were cancelled because of World War II.\nThe success of the Tokyo bid followed a personal address from the Japanese prime minister during the presentation stage, in which he allayed fears over the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant 150 miles (240km) from the city by saying: \"It has never done, and will never do, any damage to Tokyo.\"\nThe plant had been leaking radiation after an earthquake and tsunami hit the north east of the country in 2011.\n\"I cannot believe it,\" Japanese fencing Olympic silver medallist Yuki Ota told BBC Sport. \"A thousand times I imagined Jacques Rogge opening the paper - it has become a reality.\n\"After the earthquake everyone in Japan was depressed but now we have to make a dream come true.\"\nOlympic hosts since 1972 1972: Munich, West Germany\nMunich, West Germany 1976: Montreal, Canada\nMontreal, Canada 1980: Moscow, Soviet Union\nMoscow, Soviet Union 1984: Los Angeles, US\nLos Angeles, US 1988: Seoul, South Korea\nSeoul, South Korea 1992: Barcelona, Spain\nBarcelona, Spain 1996: Atlanta, US\nAtlanta, US 2000: Sydney, Australia\nSydney, Australia 2004: Athens, Greece\nAthens, Greece 2008: Beijing, China\nBeijing, China 2012: London, UK\nLondon, UK 2016: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil 2020: Tokyo, Japan\nThe prime minister's presentation also revealed the role sport had played in boosting the country in the past two years and pointed out that no Japanese athlete had failed a drugs test at an Olympics or Paralympics.\nIt added sponsorship would reach record levels and 10 new permanent sports venues would be constructed, including the Olympic Stadium, which will be finished by 2019 in time to host the Rugby World Cup.\nFor Istanbul, their campaign had not been able to overcome concerns about serious political unrest in the country, a series of doping scandals among the country's athletes, the jailing of political opponents and journalists, plus the conflict in neighbouring Syria.\nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had flown to Buenos Aires from the G20 summit in Russia to argue the Turkish city's case.\nBut his efforts were to no avail, and Istanbul registered its fifth failed bid.

{{The most important thing to remember when preparing for a fantasy Olympics draft is never to let patriotism get in the way.\nOK, let\u2019s back up a second. I know what you\u2019re thinking. A fantasy what? Olympics?\nWith as much time as men (and women) spend in fantasy football, baseball, basketball and hockey leagues, is it really necessary to make up a fantasy Olympics league?\nThe answer is yes. It is.\nAllow me to explain.\nI got the idea before the 2010 Vancouver Games. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the first person ever to organize fantasy Olympics, but it\u2019s not like you can just log on to cbssports.com and join a league. This required grunt work. Old school style. The league needed to be built by hand, from the bottom.\nFirst task was to figure out what the rosters would look like. The good thing about the Winter Games is there are far fewer sports and events than in the Summer Games. So it was easy to craft a roster that in some way encompassed each sport. The scoring system was simple: five points for a gold, three for a silver, one for a bronze. In team sports, points were doubled, the logic there being that individuals can medal in multiple events, whereas a team like hockey can only potentially grab one medal.\nSo I got together with seven friends in February 2010 and we sat around drafting athletes like the Linger Brothers (luge), Kim Yu-Na (figure skating) and Petter Northug (cross-country skier). We had no idea who 99 percent of the athletes were we drafted. But it didn\u2019t matter.\nWe never laughed more or had more fun doing a fantasy draft. And the Olympics were never more intriguing. We found ourselves glued to our TVs and computer screens following all the action. The England men\u2019s curling team gave me more agita than the Mets have in years. I hung on to every move in Yu-Na\u2019s gold-medal figure-skating routine like an anxious, proud parent.\nI ended up winning the league when the Canadian men\u2019s hockey team won the gold medal to cap off the games. Our league nearly came down to the gold medal hockey game determining our champion. But I had just enough points so that a silver medal for Canada would still clinch the victory, so I was able to allow myself to root for the U.S.\nAs the Winter Olympics ended, the countdown toward the Summer Games began.\nMonday night, armed with Sports Illustrateds, newspapers and iPads, we gathered for our first-ever fantasy Summer Olympics draft.\nWe picked 12-person rosters consisting of two swimmers, two track athletes, two gymnasts, a canoer\/kayaker, a beach volleyball team, a water polo team, a basketball team and a flex, which could be someone in any other sport.\nThe draft order was determined by picking names out of a hat. In many ways, this was the most crucial part of the draft. The top two picks were slam-dunks: swimming sensations Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte, both of whom are practically guaranteed a bevy of medals.\nUnfortunately for me, I got stuck with the fourth pick. So I grabbed U.S. gymnast Jordyn Wieber, a favorite to win gold in the all-around as well as a team gold. It was a risky pick for the first round. I could have gone with a sure bet like the U.S. men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball team. But I liked the idea of an individual first.\nFor the second round I stuck with the Americans and drafted Rebecca Soni, a swimmer who\u2019s favored in both the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke. A three-time Olympic medalist, Soni is poised for a breakout Olympics.\nAnd now back to my original point. Don\u2019t let patriotism cloud your vision. If you want to draft all Americans, feel free. But don\u2019t expect to emerge victorious.\nAs the draft evolved, I ended up taking only two more Americans: gymnast Gabby Douglas and track star Sanya Richards-Ross (who\u2019s married to former New York Giant Aaron Ross).\nI eventually made a move toward the Down Under, picking up both the Australian women\u2019s water polo and basketball teams (there\u2019s a sentence I never thought I\u2019d write). Both could end up facing the U.S. for gold. For my tennis player I went with the hometown hero, Andy Murray.\nMy fourth overall pick went to the Brazilian beach volleyball team of Larissa Franca and Juliana Silva. And if you wanted to leave this column now to Google image search their names, I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\nThe tricky part of these drafts is pronouncing many of the names.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take Liu Xiang,\u201d my friend Pat hesitantly said at one point, unsure if anyone had already taken the 110-meter hurdler.\n\u201cNo, I took Sun Yang,\u201d Sean quickly replied.\nLater in the draft Pat and his brother Ken selected Chinese gymnast Yang Wei.\n\u201cHe\u2019s 5-foot-3, 120 pounds and pure heart,\u201d Pat told us.\nAll true. The only problem they later realized, Wei retired in 2009. Whoops.\nLate in the final rounds, Ken tried picking a gymnast who had already been taken in the first round.\n\u201cIs this guy available \u2014 Ley-Bron James?\u201d Grant said, mocking them.\nThat\u2019s like trying to select Drew Brees at the end of a football draft, Grant added.\nMy final pick was for my flex position \u2014 meaning I could take just about anyone.\nI settled on Im Dong-hyun, South Korean archer extraordinaire. With a name like that, how can you go wrong?\n[email protected]\nComments\ncomments\n}}

{{The USA Olympic swim team are making their way down to Rio for this year's games, and what's a road trip without a few singalongs?\nDuring their own take on carpool karaoke, the Olympians jam out to a hodgepodge of songs, including Zac Brown Band 's 2008 hit, \"Chicken Fried,\" a track that recently came in at No. 28 on Taste of Country's countdown of the top songs of the century.\n\" I thank god for my life \/ And for the stars and stripes \/ May freedom forever fly, let it ring \/ Salute the ones who died \/ And the ones that gave their lives so we don't have to sacrifice \/ All the things we love \/ Like our chicken fried ,\" the swimmers sing, while those in the back seat proudly hold up the American flag.\nThe shoutout to country music and American pride part of the video is our favorite, but we highly suggest you watch the whole thing for a good laugh. Songs from artists including Taylor Swift , Justin Bieber , Carly Pearce and many more make an appearance, as well as iconic theme songs from television shows Friends and That '70s Show.\nSo maybe the Olympians flew down to Rio, as opposed to carpooling all the way down to Brazil -- after all, they would need one major playlist for a journey that long by car. Either way, we'll support the American athletes while they compete for Olympic gold starting Friday night (Aug. 5).\n}}

{{Deron Williams\nTodd M. Adams\nOrlando Sentinel\nRecently, USA Basketball took a different approach to choosing its roster, giving more thought to building a cohesive team.\nThat is why the biggest name left off the team is bound to come from the NBA's strongest position, point guard.\nFor instance, the Clippers' Chauncey Billups and Thunder's Russell Westbrook, who made the 20-man cut, really have no chance at making the team.\nThat's because there are three phenomenal players at that position in the Clippers' Chris Paul, Nets' Deron Williams and Bulls' Derrick Rose. With no need for three point guards, probably only two will make the team, and my guess is Williams will be left off.\ntadams@tribune.com\nBlake Griffin\nK.C. Johnson\nChicago Tribune\nI see Blake Griffin standing when the musical chairs stop. Yes, international basketball rewards athleticism. However, it also rewards defensive versatility. And this is where I see Team USA officials picking the less-flashy LaMarcus Aldridge to back up Kevin Durant at power forward.\nAldridge may not be as flashy or athletic as Griffin, but he's a better overall player. He defends multiple positions, he rebounds, he's smart. Plus, Team USA has an abundance of versatile guards, so Russell Westbrook might sit because someone like Chauncey Billups might be kept because he can handle a reduced role plus play both guard positions.\nI know this: These will be tough decisions.\nkcjohnson@tribune.com\nAmare Stoudemire\nIra Winderman\nSun Sentinel\nDeserving players will no doubt be cut from the Olympic team's preliminary 20-man roster, but the bigger omissions are those not even on it.\nConsidering the Knicks' revival began with Amare Stoudemire, and considering the time Stoudemire spent playing for Jerry Colangelo while the USA Basketball czar was operating the Suns, the absence of the New York big man stands as a stark omission, particularly with size an ongoing concern with the rather smallish roster.\nOther surprising omissions from the 20-player preliminary roster are Rajon Rondo, Zach Randolph, Al Horford, Paul Pierce and Monta Ellis, players still capable of solid numbers on the international front.\niwinderman@tribune.com\nRussell Westbrook\nBarry Stavro\nLos Angeles Times\nRussell Westbrook, the speedy, 23-year-old All-Star point guard whose team has the best record this season in the NBA, will have to watch the London Olympics from the stands.\nWhy? The biggest talent glut on the USA hoops roster is at point guard and Westbrook, who is a road runner and offensive gunner, doesn't really play like a point \u2014 check out his miserable 5.4 assists a game average this season.\nBarring injury, the point guards on the final Olympic team will be Derrick Rose, Chris Paul and Deron Williams. All are court smart, can score \u2014 and move the ball around. With all the offensive talent on Mike Krzyzewski's squad, they need a PG who doesn't want to shine in the spotlight every minute.\nbstavro@tribune.com\n}}

{{British Olympic chiefs have revealed that they have designed an evacuation plan in the event that Korean tensions escalate while they are at the Winter Games.\nMore than 60 British athletes are expected to compete in Pyeongchang, South Korea in February \u2013 just 65km from the demilitarised zone dividing the North from South.\nSecurity fears in the region have soared in recent months amid the aggressive rhetoric between North Korea and US president Donald Trump and the British Olympic Association have been in weekly dialogue with the Foreign Office to monitor the situation.\nKorean tensions have soared following North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un's missile tests\nThere no plans to pull out of the Games, but emergency options have been thoroughly discussed to cover the outbreak of war while the team is overseas.\nBOA chief executive Bill Sweeney said: \u2018There seems a higher level this time obviously. We are working on all possible contingency plans.\n\u2018The only one you have in the situation of the extreme event (of war) is evacuation. We will go there with a clearly laid out evacuation plan if it is necessary. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary but the health and welfare of the delegation is our No 1 priority. We will do everything possible around the issue.\n\u2018We would take our advice from the embassy and Foreign Office. We also have really good relations with the US Olympic Committee. We work with them on joint initiatives and they have 200,000 servicemen there and 100,000 civilians so there intelligence is very strong.\n\u2018They announced a very strong line two weeks ago that they are have very confidence and no intention to pull out. We will get a continual appraisal, a daily basis when there.\u2019\nHe added: \u2018I lost a lot more sleep going to Rio (for the 2016 Olympics) than Pyeongchang. The security threat in Rio was a lot more personal, a lot more unpredictable \u2013 we were prepared against any opportunity around mugging and crime and the violent nature of Rio.\n\u2018They are things that are difficult to manage. South Korea as a country is really safe and secure, probably one of the safest you can go into. But clearly there is an issue around the escalation of tensions between North and South Korea and the Americans.\u2019\nThe team\u2019s chef de mission, Mike Hay, said: \u2018We've been communicating with our athletes through Facebook page and all our stakeholders and team leaders, keeping them updated. It's the pinnacle of an athlete's career so it would be a very big decision to decide not to go.\nBill Sweeney says contingency plans are in place in tensions spill over while in Pyeongchang\n\u2018We are talking hypotheticals. It's a safe place to travel right now. We certainly felt very safe (on their site visit) last week. We are conscious it's 65km from the DMZ but everything seemed really good.\u2019\nSweeney, meanwhile, is expecting a decision from the IOC in December over whether Russia will be allowed to compete in Korea, despite the evidence of state-sponsored doping in the nation.\n\u2018We don't want the same situation that occurred in Rio with four or five days to go, wondering around the village, wondering if the Russians are going to be there or not,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are two IOC commissions \u2013 the Oswald commission and the Schmitt commission - and we believe the findings of those are going to come out at the earliest in late November or as late as mid-December.\u2019\n}}

{{EXCLUSIVE: He's 6ft, 12 stone and ballet dancing to Michael Jackson... meet Lucky Liam\nLiam Tancock is willing to try anything in his pursuit of Olympic glory at London 2012 \u2014 even ballet dancing to Michael Jackson songs.\nSince January the six-foot, 12-stone swimmer, a former rugby player, has been taking weekly ballet classes with British swimming\u2019s elite training squad at Loughborough University.\nAlongside regular sessions in the pool and gym the group, which includes Joanne Jackson, Lizzie Simmonds and Fran Halsall, have also tried kick-boxing, rock climbing and Pilates.\nOn target: Liam Tancock is competing at the FINA Swimming World Championships, in Shanghai\n\u2018You name it, we\u2019ve probably done it \u2014 or we\u2019ll try it,\u2019 said Tancock, the 50m long course world record-holder and world champion, who races in the World Championships 100m backstroke final in Shanghai on Tuesday.\nThe 50m backstroke is not an Olympic event, so Tancock\u2019s training has been geared towards the 100m. He said: \u2018I believe if you\u2019ve got a goal out there, there\u2019s not just one route to it. We think outside the box quite a bit. We do a lot of cross-training \u2014 it keeps it fun, it keeps it interesting and varied.\n\u2018We went on a training camp in Majorca. We got up in the morning and went on a 40km bike ride. Came back, got in the pool for a couple of hours, did some weights and then even went down to the beach and did some circuits.\nAmbition: Tancock will be going for gold in London\n\u2018It was about 9am until 3pm. It was amazing \u2014 you got so fit, so ready and it was fun as well.\u2019\nBut the ballet sessions, led by Italian dance instructor Arianna Maiorani, have been particularly beneficial.\nTancock, 26, said: \u2018Ballet dancers are really strong. They have great physiques with a strong core and they\u2019re really aware of how their body moves and works. And that\u2019s what we want to do in the water: we want to be strong, to have great core (strength) and flow.\n\u2018We don\u2019t do the ballet positions \u2014 it\u2019s more about the movement patterns and the way you hold your body.\n\u2018We use different music. My favourite was when they put some Michael Jackson on. You can\u2019t help but muck about then but, generally, we take it seriously.\n\u2018But we look so out of place! When we first got in there our instructor thought, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d\n\u2018But now she says we\u2019ve come so far. It\u2019s good fun.\u2019\n\u2018Fun\u2019 is a word Tancock uses a lot. He professes to enjoy the early-morning starts, and even remembers the notoriously gruelling training camps planned by former head of British swimming, Bill Sweetenham, with a smile.\nPressure is not something Tancock claims to recognise. When we talk about what it will feel like to carry the expectation of a nation at London 2012, he is hesitant about accepting the tag.\nHe\u2019s not even sure whether his family \u2014 mum Kim, a teaching assistant, dad Tony and older brother Ryan, who work in the building trade, and girlfriend Caitlin McClatchy, a double Commonwealth gold medallist in the 200m and 400m freestyle \u2014 have got tickets. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be aware of that,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018People talk about pressure but if you don\u2019t accept the pressure, it can\u2019t affect you.\nRelaxed: Tancock (front) is not worried about the pressure he will be under in London\n\u2018I feel like my stars must be lined up, or something. To have a home Olympics in your lifetime is pretty special, but to have it in an age where, potentially, I\u2019ll be at my best, well, that\u2019s lucky, isn\u2019t it?\n\u2018I don\u2019t see 2012 being the end of my career. I don\u2019t know how long my career will last, but definitely as long as I\u2019m enjoying it.\u2019\nBetter keep up the ballet dancing, then.\n}}

{{To describe an Olympic loss as \"hard\" is an understatement, but it\u2019s the first word that comes to BMXer Connor Fields\u2019 mind when describing his seventh-place finish in the London Games in 2012.\n\u201cI was the No. 1 seed in the final, and I, in my heart, in my soul, expected I was going to come home with a medal,\u201d Fields tells Us Weekly. \u201cAnd then our event is over so fast \u2014 in 30 seconds it was done. I didn\u2019t get the medal that I had set out to get and it was very hard to swallow, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been dealing with for the last three and a half years. It\u2019s something that\u2019s fueled the fire for Rio.\u201d\nThe athlete, now 23, was just 19 at the London Olympics, competing for the first time professionally (BMXers must be 19 to race at the elite level). After the loss, he just kept riding to mask the pain.\n\u201cI was racing again three weeks later, and I raced like six more times in 2012, so I just kind of covered up the disappointment with, \u2018I\u2019m going to keep racing, keep racing, keep racing, keep racing,\u2019\u201d the Ralph Lauren\u2013sponsored athlete explained. \u201cSo I never really had to stop and deal with it until a year or two later, when it kind of sunk in more.\u201d\nBack then, Fields says, his \u201cwhole world was London.\u201d\n\u201cThere was nothing else; it was London. And I was Connor Fields, the BMX racer,\u201d he explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything else going on in my life. I think now I\u2019m a lot more balanced, and I understand that I can go and I can win in Rio, and it would be amazing and it would be a dream come true, but there is more to me than just that. If I lose, I understand that again there is more to life than just that medal, whereas four years ago I would live and die by the medal.\u201d\nIn April, Fields' dreams were almost dashed, as he broke his hand in preparation for the second round of the BMX World Cup. Fortunately, just in time for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, student shared good news with his followers.\n\u201cIt is finally official: After starting off the Olympic qualification period in some of the best form of my life, I was thrown a massive curveball with my injury,\u201d he posted on Instagram on June 23. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through, but the story still has a chance for a happy ending. I am now 100% healthy and I have officially qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.\u201d\nThe only thing that could be sweeter would be getting that elusive medal.\n\u201cIt would mean the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the sacrifices that I\u2019ve made, every day, from the time I was a kid \u2014 skipping school dances, not hanging out with my friends, not getting to try new things, not getting to have a normal college experience, doing all of the things that I didn\u2019t get to do because I was training or racing. It would be such a great way to almost be rewarded for all my efforts. The other way I look at it is that it\u2019s the greatest gift I could give to everybody along the way who helped me. If I could have that medal, it would almost be the greatest way to say, 'Thank you; you helped me earn this.'\u201d\nThe Rio Olympics begin August 5 and will be streamed live on NBCOlympics.com and on the NBC Sports app. The Rio Paralympics begin September 7 and will be streamed live on TeamUSA.org.\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{{EUGENE -- TrackTown USA president Vin Lananna called coaching the men's U.S. track and field team at this month's Rio Olympic games one of the most rewarding experiences of his professional life.\nLess than a week since returning from Brazil, though, Lananna isn't soaking in the afterglow. He and other organizers in Eugene have plunged into executing their plan for what he hopes will be another career highlight -- hosting the 2021 IAAF track and field world championships at Hayward Field.\nRenovations at the University of Oregon stadium have begun in small ways, with the move of a cell phone tower, Lananna said, but much bigger changes are coming over the course of the two-year project. The Bowerman Building and west grandstand will eventually be torn down and replaced with a modern grandstand with the flexibility to seat up to 30,000. Additional space will house the Bowerman Sports Science Clinic, according to a project summary presented to the UO board of trustees a year ago.\nIn May, Lananna described a renovation timeline that would begin with work on the stadium's east side this fall and be completed by April, when construction will halt as Hayward hosts the Pac-12 track and field championships, the Oregon state high school meet, the Prefontaine Classic and NCAA outdoor championships.\nFunding for the project isn't yet complete, said Lananna, who added that because of his extended stay in Brazil, he wasn't certain how large the funding gap currently is.\n\"I think we are in a position where we'll be able to start the project,\" he said.\nLananna has many irons in the fire. He declared his candidacy for the USA Track & Field presidency in July. Voting will take place in December, and if elected, Lananna will remain TrackTown USA president and an associate athletic director at UO.\nBut one job is off his plate: U.S. men's coach in Rio. It's typically a \"one-shot deal\" to coach an Olympic team, he said, but the United States' medal haul might warrant the U.S. Olympic Committee asking him back.\nThe U.S. won 32 medals in track and field, its most in a non-boycott Olympics since 1932. Several were won by athletes with ties to UO or the state, chief among them Sam Barlow High School graduate Ryan Crouser, who set the Olympic shot put record to win gold; former Ducks runner Matthew Centrowitz winning the first U.S. gold at 1,500 meters since 1908; former Duck Galen Rupp winning marathon bronze in his second-ever competition at that distance; and Ashton Eaton repeating as the decathlon gold medalist.\n\"There have been a lot of great things I'm fortunate to be part of,\" Lananna said. \"I'm not sure that there's anything that's been quite as rewarding or exciting and as tiring as the Olympic games. Quite honestly it was fantastic. ... It really validated that Oregon was the center of track and field in the United States.\"\nNot to mention that public address announcers inside the track and field stadium were the longtime voices of Hayward Field's, Paul Swangard and Garry Hill.\n\"I thought I was at Hayward Field,\" Lananna said.\nMore than hardware was brought back from Brazil, however.\nThough Lananna said Rio as a host \"exceeded expectations,\" he tried to poll athletes to understand how their time in Rio could be improved when a new generation of athletes competes in Eugene in five years. Some of those changes will come naturally, given the enormous difference in size and logistical hurdles between Rio and Eugene.\nFor instance, the drive from the U.S. training facility in Brazil to the stadium would be comparable to the distance from Eugene to Albany.\n\"It'll be a lot easier to move around in Eugene, Oregon, than it was in Rio, and I think some of that was just the nature of traffic and other things that took place,\" he said. \"I think we'll have a little bit better layout in terms of their practice venues.\"\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif\n}}

{{Star watchers and hero worshipers should get an eyeful at the Special Olympics here July 31-Aug. 8.\nFamous movie stars will take part in the Games, including Jane Fonda who will conduct an aerobics class for parents of some of the 4,700 mentally retarded Olympians. Arnold Schwarzenegger will flex his muscles at a weightlifting workshop.\nSuperstars of sport will appear, too. Michael Jordan will soar and slam in a basketball clinic. Pele will exhibit his matchless soccer skills.\nWhitney Houston will sing during the Opening Ceremonies Aug. 2 at Notre Dame Stadium, where 60,000 fans will observe the march of the athletes from 66 nations.\nFor the next eight days, these athletes will compete at Notre Dame and at nearby St. Mary`s College in 14 sports in a hero-worshiper`s dream called the 7th International Summer Special Olympics.\nOf course, hero-worshiping is an individual thing. It could be that Fonda, Jordan, Pele or some of the 60,000 fans, or some of the 18,000 volunteers, might select as a personal favorite a Special Olympics athlete such as Paul Williams, Polly Lynn Oberg or Rene Camire.\nWilliams is the 22-year-old Australian runner who won a silver medal in the 1983 Special Olympics in Baton Rouge. He then dedicated the medal to a young handicapped friend who had recently died.\nOberg, told by doctors she would not walk because of malformed hip sockets, thrilled the Baton Rouge crowd with a brilliant gymnastics performance that earned her two gold medals.\nCamire, 10, of Saco, Me., expects to compete here in the 50- and 200-yard dashes and in the baseball throw. Asked to describe herself, she said, ''I`m a person. . . a good, neat, awesome person. I`m awesome.''\nRene Camire`s mother, Connie, as she explained the effect of Special Olympics on her daughter, put into words the purpose Eunice Kennedy Shriver had in mind when she founded the organization in 1968.\n''Special Olympics gives mentally retarded people so much self-esteem,'' she said. ''They`re thrilled when fellow athletes win, too. Sure, there is a competitive rivalry, but not at the expense of others.''\nAs in the regular Olympics, gold, silver and bronze medals will be awarded to the first three finishers in each event. Additionally, since there are no ''losers'' here, every entrant will be awarded a ribbon.\nThis philosophy is embodied in the oath taken by each athlete: ''Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.''\nResidents of the greater South Bend area (Michiana) have volunteered in staggering numbers to help this Special Olympics.\nErv Derda, board chairman of the local not-for-profit company that runs the Games, set a fundraising goal of $4.8 million. Eighty percent of that money was in hand last March, and the goal has been surpassed. The goal for volunteers was 15,000. Almost 18,000 persons volunteered to serve as judges, timers, guides, hosts, drivers, interpreters, physicians, nurses, security people, huggers or shoulders-to-lean-upon.\nCorporate sponsorship runs into millions of dollars. There is an\n''official'' Special Olympics soft drink, automobile, airline, printer, soap, bank, etc.\nNotre Dame, which provides housing for 4,700 athletes and 1,300 coaches, benefited when an Italian firm provided a ''generous discount'' on a $320,000 improvement to the Irish running track.\nHero worship is an individual thing. A Special Olympian from Zimbabwe, China or Tobago may wish, after he returns home, to correspond with a volunteer who befriended him so far from home.\nIf this happens, the corresponding will be easy, thanks to the 4th, 5th and 6th graders at Walt Disney Elementary School in Osceola, Ind.\nThe Walt Disney kids, accepting donations of goods from a leather and a plastics company, cut, punched, and packaged exactly 61,496 Friendship Tags to be distributed among athletes and their families.\n''You can exchange tags,'' said Tom Szumski, a teacher at the school,\n''and write a letter to someone in Tunisia, for example.''\nSpeaking of local area grade-schoolers, kids at Beiger School in Mishawaka probably think their teachers are the heroes and heroines of the Games. After all, they kissed a pig to help the cause.\nBeiger kids competed to see which room would have the greatest amount of Special Olympics dollars stuffed into a jug on its teacher`s desk. The teacher of the best fundraisers had to kiss a pig brought to school from a nearby farm.\nThe fundraising among rooms was so close that several teachers puckered up.\nWhy South Bend? Notre Dame, for a variety of reasons, obviously was attractive to Shriver`s Washington-based Special Olympics headquarters.\nNotre Dame`s name is known worldwide. Notre Dame, its retired president Rev. Theodore Hesburgh and the Kennedy family have been close. The campus is the ideal size to house the 6,000 athletes and coaches. It has splendid athletic facilities. It is close to Chicago, a city that has a special feeling for Special Olympics and hosted the first two meets in 1968 and 1970 at Soldier Field.\nFurthermore, Notre Damers have been helping Special Olympics since its inception. Three famed Irish football figures--Ziggie Czarobski, Paul Hornung and Pat O`Malley Sr.--helped the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation organize the first Games in Chicago. Jim Mello, Irish fullback in the 1950s, served as a consultant to Eunice Kennedy Shriver at those Games.\nNevertheless, if it were not for one man, these Special Olympics would be opening elsewhere, probably Syracuse, N.Y., or Eugene, Ore.\nThat man was the late Bill Locke Sr., recreation director for the Council for the Retarded of St. Joseph`s County until his death two years ago at the age of 54. Locke was regarded as ''Mr. Special Olympics'' in the South Bend area.\nIn 1983, Locke and Notre Dame hockey coach Lefty Smith went to the Special Olympics in Baton Rouge.\nSmith, president of the College Hockey Coaches Association, sought to introduce hockey into the Winter Special Games. Locke accompanied a group of five South Bend-area Special Olympians, including his son, Bill Jr., a track man.\nBefore he left Baton Rouge, Locke put a bronze medal around his son`s neck. When he and his delegation deplaned at Indianapolis on their way home, they were met in a van by Sue Coffman of South Bend.\n}}

{{Many are calling this year\u2019s U.S. Olympics coverage by NBC the highest rated and most extensive (in terms of reach) in history. Darryl Jefferson would certainly agree, although he might add the phrase \u201cphysically and mentally taxing.\u201d\nFor him, as director of post-production operations for NBC\u2019s \u201cHighlights Factory,\u201d it\u2019s been an all-encompassing endeavor that has seen him act more like an orchestra conductor than content creation supervisor. Matching the network\u2019s massive 5500 hours of content with an unknown amount of highlights suitable for all digital delivery platforms is daunting, but he\u2019s taking it all in stride \u2014 at least from the highlights development side for everything not appearing on TV.\nFrom his single multi-screen workstation in New York City, Jefferson oversees teams of editors, producers and camera crews in New York, London, Connecticut and Florida. Since the Olympics began (and well before), he has spent 16-hour days keeping the Highlights Factory \u2014 or \u201cthe off-tube factory,\u201d as the team affectionately calls it \u2014 team operating smoothly.\nOften exhausted, Jefferson said he \u201cremembers a 26-hour day, but is not really sure how we got through that.\u201d When there\u2019s a fire to put out \u2014 like when the coverage of a live event suddenly switches to an unexpected commercial, or a late-breaking sports score needs to get reported immediately \u2014 he\u2019s the guy to do it.\nServing the digital domain\nThe entire highlights team (about 170 people in NYC alone serving the disparate yet inherently linked digital platforms) typically works 22 hours per day, in three shifts, to make sure consumers are getting all of the timely highlights they require on their TV, cell phone, tablet and computers. Within hours of a live event, a short clip is logged, edited and packaged into a \"highlight\" for download to millions of cable set-top boxes or accessed on the www.nbcolympics.com website. This is happening hundreds of times per day.\nA team of interns and producers monitor 35 concurrent sporting events to mine the best highlight clips.\nIndeed, to make sense of the 35 concurrent events that were being monitored at any one time, they are using an Avid Interplay MAM system. Highlights production teams use it to quickly select, edit and prepare packages for distribution to all of the various media outlets. It\u2019s the same system used for the 2008 Olympics In Beijing, China.\nThis multi-level infrastructure involved a total of 550TB of Avid Isis storage, when you factor in the International Broadcast Center (IBC) facilities in London, the NBC News facility in New York and the Highlights Factory at 30 Rockefeller Plaza (all employing Avid Interplay Deliver software for the high-speed transfer of audio and video clips to the other NBC News locations in NY, DC, LA and Miami).\nAccording to David Frasco, director of Network Accounts for Avid, HD nonlinear edit suites in London\u2019s IBC are outfitted with seven Avid Symphony and 26 Media Composer systems for high-end editing and 5.1 surround sound. These systems are connected to the Avid ISIS shared storage and Avid Interplay production asset management systems. (Users are able to quickly browse the Interplay MAM proxy and transfer material faster than real-time for use in Symphony and Media Composer editing software applications.) In addition, Avid AirSpeed 5000 servers are used in conjunction with an ISIS 7000 system to create turnkey production islands at the Olympic venues, including gymnastics, swimming, diving, and track and field.\nA watershed moment for TV\n\u201cThis Olympics has been a real watershed moment for live sports production,\u201d said Jefferson, who is completing work on his third Olympics. \u201cThe fact that I can look in on and control operations in London, Connecticut and Miami from my desk in New York is really powerful. I can trigger a record feed from anywhere we are situated and have it on my desktop in a matter of seconds.\u201d\nHe\u2019s talking about managing 50 simultaneous live feeds coming in from London, eight in New York and several others that are being used for archiving content (in Connecticut and Florida) and parsing them out to NBC\u2019s various locations.\nThe use of metadata is a big part of NBC\u2019s success, working with ScheduAll (ingest scheduling for Highlights Factory channel in New York and London); OPIS (a custom NBC Olympics-created video logging system); Cyradis (for ingest schedule import, ingest triggering and other system actions); IDS (for the import and conversion of real-time competition information and statistics); Harmonic (MediaGrid storage), MOG Solutions (using the F-1000 software for automatic digital media conforming); and Sony XDCAM stations recording high- and low-res material.\nMetadata makes the magic\nThe technology infrastructure allows for digital ad insertion that has been targeted to different regions of the country (and different sporting events). Each new media platform has its own set of metadata, which must be logged correctly or the proper clips will not show up where it\u2019s supposed to. An editor or producer can simply call up an event and have access to all of the live and previously recorded elements generated from that venue.\nA virtual army of interns in New York used the Interplay MAM archiving module to view proxies, add logging notes, select shots and create edit decision lists (EDLs). The EDLs then triggered requests back to London for the high-resolution material that matched the specific EDL. Based on the EDLs, MXF-wrapped flattened files were created and transferred from London to New York. The content was subsequently forwarded to craft edit stations to create the final content packages dedicated for distribution.\nWhile most of the infrastructure is file-based, there is a fair amount of videotape being used in London, as well data tape (LTO-5) for archiving on a SpectraLogic T950 library that holds 900 LTO tapes. Jefferson said at the mid point of the games, NBC had archived both raw and finished footage onto more than 3000 hours in Connecticut. There are also a number of Sony XDCAM decks outfitted with solid-state memory for recording specific feeds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing more with less resources at these Games, and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but we feel like we have a handle on it all,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something unexpected that comes our way, but the way we have served viewers wherever they might be has been astounding. And I don't use that word very often.\u201d\n}}

{{Chinese technology used to halt the rain at the Games\u2026\nA new method of controlling the weather at UK festivals could be on the way \u2013 after Olympic Games officials in Beijing managed to prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony in the Chinese city on Friday (August 8).\nThe Independent reports that organisers used a new system which involved firing 1,100 rockets into the sky before the ceremony, preventing rain over the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, which had been forecasted.\nThe rockets controlled the weather by inducing rain from clouds before the clouds got near to the stadium. The rockets induce rain by releasing particles that cause water vapour to freeze, then fall from the sky as rain.\nSince reports of the weather control system were published music fans have e-mailed NME.COM to suggest that the system be used over here to help create rain-free festivals.\nMany festivals, such as Glastonbury 2005 and 2007, have been marred by huge downpours, resulting in muddy fields and making for very difficult conditions for fans.\nHowever, it seems unlikely that Michael Eavis and fellow festival organisers will be investing in the technology until its cost comes down.\nAccording to the organisers the weather control system costs \u201cmillions\u201d of pounds to run.\n}}

{{Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky will give back his Olympic bronze medal after failing a drug test at the Pyeongchang Games, a spokeswoman for the Russian Curling Federation told state TV.\nKrushelnitsky tested positive for the banned substance meldonium, which is believed to help blood circulation, after winning bronze in mixed doubles with his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova.\n\"We have signed a statement that indeed he did have (meldonium in the sample) and as a result we will give the medal back,\" Russian Curling Federation spokeswoman Valentina Parinova told state TV channel Russia 1.\nWord comes as the International Olympic Committee is due to decide Saturday whether to formally reinstate the Russian team for the closing ceremony. Russia was banned from the Pyeongchang Olympics over widespread doping at the Sochi Games four years ago, but 168 Russians including Krushelnitsky were allowed by the IOC to compete as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" under the Olympic flag.\nKrushelnitsky and Bryzgalova became the first Russians to compete at the Winter Olympics since the doping scandal at the Sochi Games when they competed in a preliminary-round game Feb. 8, the day before the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang.\nA statement in Krushelnitsky's name published by state news agency Tass said he accepted the substance had been found in his sample but that he had not doped intentionally.\n\"I accept a formal breach of the current anti-doping rules,\" the statement read, adding that he will waive his right to a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport because it would be \"useless and senseless\" for Krushelnitsky and Bryzgalova to fight the case.\nHowever, the statement added that they consider themselves \"clean athletes\" and could contest any proceedings from the World Curling Federation, which could seek to have Krushelnitsky banned from the sport.\nRussian curling officials have said they believe Krushelnitsky's food or drink could have been spiked with meldonium either by Russia's political enemies or by jealous Russian rival athletes who had not made the Olympic team.\nCAS secretary general Matthieu Reeb told The Associated Press on Thursday morning that a hearing was still scheduled for 2 p.m. despite the Russian statements.\nShibutani Sibling Dynamics and Life After the Olympics\nSiblings and ice dancers Maia and Alex Shibutani visits NBC after winning bronze at Pyeongchang to talk about their unique sibling dynamics, future goals and life after the Olympics.

Credit: AFP\/Getty Images\nWith the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia fast approaching, the Olympic torch is already a month into its journey from Greece to the site of this winter's games. This year, the Russians decided to take a side trip to where no torch has gone before.\nThe torch is currently on board the International Space Station, having been carried there on Thursday on board a Russian Soyuz craft. Tomorrow, two cosmonauts will take a spacewalk with the sporting symbol, which you can watch on NASA TV starting at 9:30 in the morning, U.S. Eastern time. On Sunday, the torch returns to Earth to begin the rest of its relay to Sochi, stopping in towns throughout Russia along the way.\nThe route to the games began in October. It concludes on February 7, 2014, when the torch-bearer will light the Olympic flame at the opening ceremony.\n}}

{{If you were looking for a bargain on a rare and valuable piece of memorabilia from the Calgary 1988 Olympics and pin trading is a little below your tax bracket, you just missed your opportunity.\nA torch from the 1988 Olympic relay just sold at auction in Boston for $46,184. That may seem like a big spend, even for those suffering oilpatch one percenters who might be in the market for a classic bit of Calgary iconography, until you realize it came in below the pre-auction estimate of $50,000 to $60,000. And for collectors who know torches from the 1988 relay are among the most valuable, the price is a positive steal.\nStill, Bobby Livingstone of RR Auction said both the company and the consignor of the torch \u2014 an unnamed 1988 delegate of the International Olympic Committee \u2014 were satisfied.\n\u201cThe Calgary torch did not quite get its pre-auction estimate but (we) are extremely thrilled with the price it did achieve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market for Olympic collectibles is strong.\u201d Livingstone said the American buyer of the torch wished to remain anonymous.\nUnlike more recent Olympic relays that are made up of thousands of torches, only about 150 were produced for Calgary\u2019s before being passed between 6,500 torchbearers across the country. That scarcity makes them valuable.\nOther notable sales at the RR Auction Olympic event was a gold medal from the 1924 Chamonix games that went for $47,746 and a gold medal from the 1984 Los Angeles Games that was bought for $41,806.\n}}

{{\u2022 CAS statement will be made on Monday 30 April at 3pm \u2022 Sprinter and cyclist's lifetime bans are likely to be lifted\nThe court of arbitration for sport will announce its decision over the validity of the British Olympic Association's bylaw which bans drugs cheats from all future Olympic Games at 3pm on Monday.\nThe BOA revealed last week that it is resigned to defeat in its battle to keep a bylaw which has allowed it to ban any drug cheats from competing at a future Olympics for life since 1992.\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) insist the bylaw is \"non-compliant\" with its global charter on anti-doping, which states an athlete found guilty of taking a prohibited substance should be given a two-year ban.\nThe CAS heard arguments from both sides at a hearing in London last month and it confirmed in a statement on Friday that a verdict will be announced at 3pm (BST) on Monday.\n\"In the arbitration between the British Olympic Association (BOA) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the CAS will issue its decision on Monday, 30 April 2012 at 4.00pm (Swiss time),\" the statement read.\n\"The BOA filed an appeal following Wada's determination that a BOA bylaw providing that any British athlete 'who has been found guilty of a doping offence... shall not... thereafter be eligible for consideration as a member of a Team GB... in relation to any Olympic Games' was non-compliant with the world anti-doping code.\"\nAlthough the BOA has had no indication from the court, senior officials have confirmed they are preparing for defeat. It means that the sprinter Dwain Chambers and the cyclist David Millar, who have both previously served bans for doping, now look set to be part of Team GB for the London 2012 Olympics.\nThe news that the BOA expect to lose its case has been met with disappointment by leading British figures in the Olympic movement, such as the London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe and the four-time gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy.\nCoe last week reiterated his support for the BOA's bylaw. \"My position on this is well known,\" he said. \"I think it is right for sporting organisations to have the autonomy to decide who they want to see in their teams.\"\nHoy said it would be \"sad if we have to fall in line with the rest of the world\".\nThe former Olympic triple jump champion Jonathan Edwards, a member of the London 2012 board who won gold at the Sydney Games 12 years ago, does not agree with Coe and Hoy, claiming a lifetime ban is too harsh, although he does admit a two-year suspension is too lenient.\n\"Athletes should get a second chance. I wouldn't personally support a lifetime ban,\" said Edwards. \"The reason the BOA brought their bylaw in is because four-year bans for a serious drug offence turned into two. Two years is simply not enough. It's too lenient. It sends out the wrong kind of message. An athlete should miss one Olympic cycle if they test positive for drugs. What the world needs to do is to unite and introduce four-year bans. Then we would be in a much stronger position.\"\n}}

It will have summited Mount Elbrus, Europe's highest peak. It will have descended to the bottom of Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. It will have been transported by plane, train, car, icebreaker, and, yes, reindeer sleigh to more than 130 cities and towns in Russia. It will have traveled nearly 40,000 miles\u2014the longest route in Olympic history\u2014carried by some 14,000 people.

Is it really a good idea to have an open flame in the ISS? And, no, it is not. Both because fire is, in general, best avoided in closed quarters ... but also because a flame would consume oxygen\u2014a precious commodity in space. During its jaunt outside of Earth, apparently, the torch will use an \"imitation flame.\"\nAnd then ... it will be taken it out into space. On Saturday, the cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazanskiy, who are currently crewing the Station, will conduct an EVA. And they'll bring, along with all their other equipment, a tool of a more ceremonial variety.

{{GANGNEUNG, South Korea (AP) -- Adam Rippon put his hands over his face and let the cheers wash over. He waved and smiled, and when the crowd kept clapping, he jumped where he stood and swung his arms to egg them on.\nEver the showman, and with his trademark grace and flair, Rippon took his final skate of the Pyeongchang Olympics on Saturday. He finished 10th, a fine result for a 28-year-old who was never expected to medal against a field populated by younger, higher-flying competition.\nThe self-proclaimed \"icon\" didn't need that hardware to leave his mark on these games.\nOr for the Olympics to leave its mark on him.\n\"They usually say that like, after the Olympic Games, somebody's life changes forever,\" Rippon said. \"A lot of times it's the gold medalist, but I have a feeling that my life has changed forever.\"\nRippon has been the headline-grabbing darling of the Pyeongchang Games, a status earned in part with his near-flawless skating, but even more with his efforts off the ice.\nHe and skier Gus Kenworthy are America's only two openly gay male athletes, and they've flaunted their LGBT pride on social media throughout the Olympics. Kenworthy and his boyfriend were in the stands to watch Rippon on Saturday, waving an American flag with rainbow patterning in place of red and white stripes. Rippon said he plans to watch Kenworthy compete, too.\nRippon's path to Pyeongchang included a public spat with Vice President Mike Pence, whom the LGBT community considers an opponent for signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in March 2015 as Indiana's governor. Critics said the legislation encouraged discrimination against gay people. An amendment with protections for the LGBT community was passed a week later.\nRippon criticized the White House in January for choosing Pence to lead its official delegation for the opening ceremony. When a USA Today report said Pence was hoping to sit down with Rippon, the figure skater said he had no interest in meeting with Pence until at least after the games.\nPa. native Adam Rippon is making history at 2018 Winter Olympics Rippon is the oldest American figure skater since 1936 to make their Olympic debut. He is also the first openly gay American man to compete in the Winter Games.\nThe \"brouhaha\" -- Rippon's word -- mostly dissipated during as Rippon made his Olympic debut. He helped the Americans win a bronze medal in the team event, then put on a pair of clean skates in the individual competition.\nAll the while, he charmed away during interviews with his striking ease and wit. His personality -- he proudly told The Associated Press in November he's \"a little trashy, but really fun\" -- cemented his Olympic stardom, catching attention from stars including Reese Witherspoon and Elmo.\nHow does he feel about that?\n\"Well, you know, on the spectrum from Reese Witherspoon to Elmo, I'm like excited at about, like, a Meryl Streep,\" he told NBC this week. \"Does that make sense?\"\nThose around him say the buzzy one-liners aren't an act. Fellow American skater Ashley Wagner said this week that \"he's like this 24\/7. It's exhausting.\"\nWinter Olympics 2018: Highlights from Saturday, Feb. 17 36 Gallery: Winter Olympics 2018: Highlights from Saturday, Feb. 17\nA taste of Rippon's best work just from Saturday:\n--On his plans for the rest of the Olympics: \"I'm probably going to have like a stiff drink later.\"\n--On the Olympic spotlight: \"Sometimes I just get attention, and I really don't know how it happens.\"\n--On his legacy: \"You know, I'm not like a gay icon, or America's gay sweetheart. I'm just America's sweetheart and I'm just an icon.\"\nCertainly, this month has opened doors for Rippon. He wouldn't say for sure Saturday that he's ready to retire from competition, but at 28, he seems unlikely to keep going much longer.\nHe'd be a hit on television -- perhaps following in the footsteps of fellow American skating star Johnny Weir, now a personality on NBC who helps host figure skating and Kentucky Derby coverage. There's no doubt that if Rippon wants, he can parlay his celebrity into some sort of public post-skating career.\nWith what he showed in South Korea, it'd be surprising if he doesn't want that.\nHe's given the world a taste of himself, and even after he's done skating, it's going to want more.\n\"I think I've shown the world that I'm a fierce competitor,\" he said. \"But I think I've shown them that I'm also a fierce human being.\"\n-- Story By Jake Seiner\n}}

{{It started like a Tuesday evening group jog around Lake Merritt. But the finalists in the women\u2019s 1,500 meters had something in mind at Olympic Stadium.\nThey knew they could not stay with world-record holder Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia, one of the greatest middle-distance runners of their generation.\nSo, San Francisco\u2019s Shannon Rowbury and fellow competitors turned the opening act of the event into an almost laughable race walk while jogging through the first lap in 76 seconds.\nThe slow pace led to a mad-sprint finish, with Kenya\u2019s Faith Kipyegon winning in 4 minutes, 8.92 seconds, a 1.35-second cushion over stunned silver medalist Dibaba. The slow-it-down strategy also helped the United States win its first 1,500-meters medal in history when Jenny Simpson outdueled Rowbury for third place.\n\u201cThis is a beautiful sport,\u201d Simpson told reporters. \u201cThere are no style points. This is all about objectively who can get to the finish line first.\u201d\nKipyegon lied on the track sobbing after a final lap of faster than 58 seconds was enough to chase down Dibaba, who set the world record last year in 3:50.07. Her only misstep occurred when momentarily stumbling during a victory lap with the Kenyan flag.\nWhile the Ethiopia-vs.-Kenya storyline played out as planned, the United States\u2019 presence was as unexpected as Dibaba\u2019s loss. Americans had become accustomed to unfilled promise in a fickle race that takes speed, endurance and strategy. The great Mary Decker Slaney, Suzy Favor Hamilton and Francie Larrieu had never won a medal despite spectacular careers.\nSimpson, 29, stepped into the spotlight to end the Americans\u2019 misfortunes in a race added to the Olympic program in 1972.\n\u201cI love feeling that stress on the last lap,\u201d Simpson told reporters. \u201cI was one of the crowd who could maybe get third so I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\nNot bad for a runner who failed to reach the final in London four years ago when Rowbury was sixth.\nSimpson, 29, crossed the line in 4:10.53, while Rowbury, 31, was .58 of a second behind in fourth.\n\u201cMy coaches knew what would bring out the best in me was being a predator and having the opportunity to run people down,\u201d Simpson said.\nShe and Rowbury took off in the final 200 meters to pass others for the finish at least Simpson had hoped to achieve.\n\u201cI want to be someone that this country can be real proud to cheer for,\u201d the Boulder, Colorado, runner added.\nShe had won the 2011 world championship and finished second two years later. But the Olympics hold a special place for general U.S. sports fans who ignore these events the rest of the four-year cycle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long ride of highs and lows,\u201d Simpson said.\nRowbury, a fourth-generation San Franciscan, has experienced a similar trajectory throughout her career. A year ago, she broke a 31-year-old American record in the 1,500 meters in the same race Dibaba got the world mark. But times haven\u2019t meant as much as results to the Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep alumna.\n\u201cUltimately you have to place well,\u201d she said a 2015 interview.\nIt seemed Kipyegon carried a similar attitude to the track Tuesday night.\nWhen Dibaba took off at the midpoint, Kipyegon quickly settled in just behind. Then came the bell lap with Dibaba immediately increasing the pace only to find Kipyegon still with her. The Kenyan had the final burst to upset the reigning world champion.\n\u201cI knew she was going to sprint ahead in the last 800 but I had prepared well and was confident I would go with her,\u201d Kipyegon told reporters. \u201cI saw the first lap was slow so I knew there was no challenge and I was flexible and ready for any pace.\u201d\nDibaba acknowledged that training has been off since her coach was arrested this summer during a sting operation in Spain where authorities confiscated 60 syringes and vials of the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin, known as EPO, at a hotel.\nShe denied any culpability in the episode with Jama Aden, who coaches a group of world-class African runners with training camps in Spain and Sweden. Dibaba said she would find a new coach if Aden is found guilty.\nIn the morning session at the track, reigning champion Christian Taylor soared to victory in the men\u2019s triple jump to become the first American to win consecutive titles in the event since 1904.\nTaylor leapt 58 feet, 71\/4 inches to secure the victory, while teammate Will Claye was second to become the first in history to earn consecutive silver medals.\nWorld champion Derek Drouin of Canada won the men\u2019s high jump with a clearance of 7 feet, 8 inches, while Omar McLeod took the 110-meter hurdles title in 13.05 seconds, giving Jamaica its first Olympic gold in the event.

Why should they?\nIt's just that Mr Beckham has about as much to do with the Olympics as Mrs Beckham with the obese.\nMonsieur Rogge made that clear yesterday in an interview which did not so much belittle Beckham as expose the crass superficiality of those who believe that trotting him out as a figurehead for London's bid would have the IOC eating out of their grasping little hands.\nWhen our Olympic chiefs are as star-struck as the public, what chance have we got? Not much, as Rogge pointed out to the Sunday Times.\nHe described it as 'naive' to suppose that officials who mingle with Olympic legends on a daily basis would be impressed by soccer players, no matter how famous. That was chastening enough. But what really cut to the deeply flawed heart of the matter was Rogge's explanation as to why 'David Beckham is not going to win you the Olympics'.\nQuite simply, no matter how many goals he scores or pairs of sunglasses he sells, he cannot take part in the Olympics.\nThat is not because he is a professional who is paid millions for kicking a football the days of the amateur ideal have long since gone - but because there is no team in which he can play the Games.\nNo England team, just as there is no Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland XI. No Great Britain team, for all the reasons of domestic culture and football politics which keep the home nations separate. AND this is the hidden fault - one which lies beneath the decrepit state of the East End and the capital's road and transport facilities - which is potentially fatal to London's campaign.\nThe Olympic football event is essential to the finances of the summer Games. The huge crowds in Seoul, Barcelona, Atlanta even, were crucial to balancing the budget.\nThose attendances were driven by the participation of the teams of the host nations.\nThat cannot happen here in 2012.\nThe new Wembley is being touted as the focal stadium for the soccer, with the likes of Old Trafford among other probable venues. But without British interest in the event, how many English fans will turn up?\nWill the Olympics vote themselves into potential deficit?\nNot likely. Not even at the behest of someone as famous for being famous as England's most famous footballer.\nThe IOC may have all manner of defects of their own but they are not blind to the imperfections of others. Thus the leaders of the London campaign, in their knee-jerk eagerness to jump aboard the Beckham bandwagon, have drawn attention to one of their own most serious impediments.\nFrance would have its football team in Paris, Spain its team in Madrid, the U.S. its team in New York but not England in London.\nGreat Britain will enter a lawn tennis team in 2012.\nTim Henman is unlikely to be Britain's No.1 by then. But, on Rogge's basis, the likeable Middle Englander who is presenting himself for national duty on Centre Court this week would be a more relevant spokesman. Especially if he wins his Wimbledon at last.\nWhether he would be daft enough to accept the post is another matter, just as it was when Sir Christopher Meyer turned down the chairmanship of the London campaign.\nMeyer - former ambassador to Washington, multilingual statesman and brilliant orator - calculated the pitfalls then made an excuse and declined.\nHenman is too bright not to recognise officials so desperate to impress that they have become the most risible manifestation of a society obsessed with celebrity over substance, with fame for its own sake rather than as a consequence of achievement.\nAfter all, their choice as chairperson - not as package tour operator for 2012 - is an American businesswoman whose credentials for trying to bring the Olympics to London are running a cheap, no frills airline.\nEasy come, Easy Go.\nIt's a tribute to trailblazing Foe that the game had to go on\nTHE FINAL of the Confederations Cup went ahead in Paris last night even though Cameroon had to play France under the shadow of grief for their team-mate Marc-Vivien Foe, who had collapsed on the pitch and died during the semi-final four days earlier.\nQuite right, too.\nHeartless? No.\nWhile our hearts go out to a fine man, his stricken family and distraught friends at a time made especially tragic by his being so young, life and work have to go on.\nFoe himself would have known the importance of that. Football was his life's work.\nIt was also his passion.\nHe could not have played the game with such strength, courage, desire and warm camaraderie were that not true.\nSo would he have wanted them to call off the Final of a championship he had been so committed to his country winning?\nOf course not.\nSportsmen die quite regularly playing the games they love, albeit not often in the televised limelight of professional or international competition where expert medical assistance is more instantly at hand.\nAccidents happen.They can be the fault of individuals but not of the sports themselves.\nSo should everybody stop playing when it happens? No more than we should all stop working for a week if a colleague collapses at his desk or workbench.\nWill they abandon the Rugby World Cup this autumn if a player breaks his neck?\nHardly.\nNot when Grand Prix drivers race on after Ayrton Senna is killed. Not when prizefighters box on while their spar-mates are on life support machines.\nYet football, in all its tedious self-importance, has been getting more and more precious since the September 11 terrorist atrocities in New York.\nSo precious that while baseball carried on in America, Champions League matches were postponed in Europe.\nHow ridiculous. For many participants the thrill of sport resides in the physical danger. Sometimes they pay the price for their excitement.\nAfrica, in its poverty, confronts more brutal realities every hour of every day.\nIt was football which brought Marc-Vivien Foe out of Cameroon as a splendid ambassador for his country and as a trailblazer for every poor young African hoping to find fortune and fame on the playing fields of Europe.\nFor Foe - as much as for every boy he and his brave story will now inspire - the game must go on.\nAs it did last night, with all due respect.\nFather knows time could be short for the Williams girls\nWHY would Richard Williams want to talk his daughters into early retirement at a time when the pair of them look so dominant and so likely to trample all-comers into the lawns of Wimbledon once more?\nBecause he is not the raving madman it amuses him to give the impression of being.\nSerena may look omnipotent and Venus appear to be rising again, but Richard can see the threat to their dominance growing more powerful by the tournament.\nNot only did Justine Henin-Hardenne relieve the family Williams of the French Open title, but the Russians are coming - in force.\nThe apparent ease with which Venus won her third-round tie glossed over some of the menace.\nNerves, just as much as the Venus forehand, got the better of young Nadia Petrova.\nBut you only had to watch some of the later rallies to know that if they meet again next year the danger to the American sisters from the big-hitters from eastern Europe will be significantly greater.\nDaddy knows the time is coming for his girls to get out of tennis and into business before their commercial value is damaged.\nWHILE the All England Club allow some unshaven Bohemian from Belarus on to the courts of Wimbledon wearing a sleeveless top which exposes his hairy armpits to distasteful and unwanted view, FIFA impose a ban on all footballers removing their shirts when celebrating the scoring of goals.\nWhat is this country of ours coming to when international soccer is more dignified than lawn tennis?\nTODAY is Mike Tyson's 37th birthday and he will spend it in court on an assault charge.\nNothing unusual here, the cynics will say.\nOnly he has been summonsed this time after being attacked by two men and a woman who recognised the former world heavyweight champion outside a Brooklyn hotel at 5am, remembered how many accusers he has had to pay off with millions of dollars so promptly attacked him to cries of: 'We've hit the jackpot.' So ,for once, America is presuming Tyson's innocence.\nWhat should really worry us is that if it had happened in this country he would be found guilty in a heartbeat.\nPlead self-defence in Britain and not only do you go to prison but you get sued by the criminal.\n}}

{{RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 When Robert was forced to stop, Christoph got going. Now the Harting brothers have an Olympic discus title each. As different as they are, gold now unites them.\nDefending champion Robert Harting was eliminated in Friday's qualifying, yet with a massive last throw in Saturday's final, Christoph made sure the title stayed in the German family.\nHarting threw 68.37 meters for a personal best on his sixth attempt, overtaking world champion Piotr Malachowski of Poland, who had been leading with 67.55.\nGermany's Christoph Harting throws the discus during the men's discus throw final at the athletics competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Olympic stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Saturday, Aug. 13, 2016.

Here's a sample \u2014 his first statement after the final: \"I am not a PR person. I do not like to answer questions and I do not look for publicity.\"\nMedalists at the Olympics have obligatory news conferences. Even there, he didn't answer questions but instead made a statement.\nIt's not that he can't be a funny guy. When he was presented for the final, he was swaying to the samba beat of the band behind him.\n\"I am someone who needs rhythm, loves rhythm,\" he said, \"but it is very tough to dance to the national anthem.\"\nIt's being the center of attention that troubles him.\n\"Extroverts want to be seen,\" he said. \"I am an introvert and feel very uncomfortable here.\"\nWith gold around his neck, he might be in for a life-changing few weeks.\n___\nFollow Raf Casert on Twitter at http:\/\/twitter.com\/rcasert\nGermany's Robert Harting competes in a qualifying round of the men's discus throw during the athletics competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Olympic stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 12, 2016.

{{NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 NBC said its Olympic audience reached parity with the London Games for the first time on the third night of competition. But there's an asterisk involved in the claim.\nThe network said that its \"total audience delivery\" was 31.5 million for the Olympics on Monday night in prime time, compared to the virtually identical 31.6 million who watched on the corresponding night in London in 2012.\nThe \"total audience delivery\" figure is a statistic NBC hurriedly invented when it saw sharp declines in its traditional ratings for the first couple of nights of the Rio de Janeiro Games. The Nielsen company said the television audience on NBC on Monday was 28.9 million \u2014 strong, but short of London levels.\nBut NBC is adding the viewership for prime-time telecasts on cable's NBCSN (1.6 million) and Bravo (720,000) and people who streamed video online (about 300,000) to boost the number to 31.5 million \u2014 its \"total audience delivery.\"\nNBC says the comparison is valid because even though the cable viewers weren't watching the same thing as people tuned in to NBC, they were still watching the Olympics. There's no comparable number from 2012, because the company didn't allow its cable affiliates and website to compete with the prime-time NBC telecast four years ago.\n\"One of the indicators of changing viewer habits, especially with these Olympics, is that our digital consumption has more than tripled from London in each of the first three days of full competition,\" NBC Sports Group chairman Mark Lazarus said. \"We've also been pleasantly surprised that our multi-platform strategy is paying big dividends.\"\nThe new calculation is about more than bragging rights. NBC will use \"total audience delivery\" to convince advertisers that they're reaching more viewers than the traditional Nielsen figures indicate.\n}}

{{The award will be presented in September during the IBC conference in Amsterdam.\nThe International Olympic Committee will receive an award at the upcoming International Broadcasting Convention (IBC) for its efforts to preserve and manage its audiovisual archives. This includes making the archives available to broadcasters and researchers.\nDating back to the first Games in modern times, in 1896, the audiovisual archives of the Olympics include 2,000 hours of film, 33,000 hours of video, 8,500 hours of audio and more than 500,000 photographs, as well as 2,000 archive documents and 22,000 pictures of Olympic Museum artifacts.\n\u201cThis project is very important for two reasons. First, it ensures that more than a century of Olympic history is preserved for the future. But perhaps even more important it draws the industry\u2019s focus on a subject which it is all too easy to ignore. Our archives risk becoming inaccessible, not just because of deterioration of assets but also because the hardware to play them is obsolete and virtually impossible to replicate,\" said Michael Lumley, chair of the IBC Awards panel.\nAt the start of their so-called \"Patrimonial Assets Management program,\" IOC archivists conducted a study and found that, within just a few years, 50 percent of the videos would be unplayable, 20 percent of the faded photographs would be unusable, and there would be no audio players available for much of the collection. Meanwhile, the films were slowly deteriorating. The project involved restoring and digitizing these asserts, while at the same time, implementing a new digital asset management system.\nToday, the business-to-business web site for the IOC archives, The Olympic Multimedia Library, is visited by 1,200 professionals each month, as well as by in-house IOC staff.\nIBC will be held Sept. 10- Sept. 15 in Amsterdam.\n(Disclosure: THR contributing tech editor Carolyn Giardina is a member of the IBC Awards jury.)\n}}

(Tim Berger\/Staff Photographer)\nKate Hansen, who will compete in the luge in the wither Olympics in Sochi greets and thanks supporters at Los Gringos Locos in La Canada Flintridge on Monday. (Tim Berger\/Staff Photographer)\nRedemption, rebirth and renewal were some of the storylines that dominated a successful sports year for the teams and students-athletes from La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge in 2013. Among some of the accolades earned were Olympic berths, CIF Southern Section championships and several bounce-back seasons from the city\u2019s programs. Here are the La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun\u2019s top 10 sports stories of 2013. 1. La Ca\u00f1ada High alumna Kate Hansen reaches Olympics. Having fallen short on a trip to the winter games in 2010, the 21-year-old Hansen was not denied this time.Hansen needed two world top-nine finishes through the first five Viessman Luge World Cup competitions this fall and winter and didn\u2019t waste any time. After finishing out of the top 10 in the first two world cups, Hansen snatched seventh at the third event in Winterbery, Germany on Dec. 1 in a time of 1 minute, 54.605 seconds. The following weekend, Hansen sealed the deal, taking sixth (1:31.851) at the fourth World Cup in Whistler, Canada on Dec. 7. Yet, Hansen\u2019s best race was still ahead of her, as she posted her highest-ever finish in taking fourth (1:27.929) at the fifth World Cup in Park City, Utah on Dec. 17. \u201cIt was difficult not making it last year and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought about for the last four years,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cOnce I was selected, it was just validation for all the hard work. I didn\u2019t have to say anymore that I just missed because I made it.\u201d The very next day, Hansen was officially selected as one of three individual qualifiers out of a 10-person luge contingent to represent the United States at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. Hansen is believed the be only the second-ever La Ca\u00f1ada High alumnus to represent her school at the Olympics after Peter Wells advance to the 2004 Sydney Games in sailing. 2. St. Francis High football enjoys a dramatic turnaround. Coming off one of its most trying seasons, St. Francis High football produced one of its most successful in 2013: starting the year on an eight-game winning streak, taking third in the Mission League and finishing at 10-3, 3-2 in league. The Golden Knights advanced to the CIF Southern Section semifinals for the first time in eight years and stacked up well against some of the best competition in the state, with all three of their losses coming against CIF Southern Section Western Division finalists Chaminade and Serra in league and the postseason. After posting playoff wins over Culver City (45-28) and Camarillo (42-21), St. Francis saw its banner year end in a hard-fought loss to Serra (22-14). Veteran St. Francis Coach Jim Bonds, who won his 100th game during the season, was confident his team would produce a better record than its 4-7, 1-4 in league mark from 2012 \u2013 as the Knights dropped four games by a touchdown or less. Still, it would have been hard to predict St. Francis' success, but it came on the backs of senior quarterback Ty Gangi and two-way starter Joe Mudie at running back and defensive back. While Gangi carried some hype into his final high school season, he was better than could have been expected. He threw for 2,882 yards, 25 touchdowns and six interceptions on 189-of-342 passing for a 100 quarterback rating. He ran for 12 more touchdowns and 421 yards on 117 carries, and also caught a touchdown. Mudie produced 1,962 total yards from scrimmage (1,350 rushing, 612 rushing) and 19 touchdowns (14 rushing, four receiving, one kickoff return). While Gangi and Mudie consistently grabbed headlines, receiver Dylan Crawford and tight end John Carroll put up impressive numbers in the passing game. The Golden Knights paved their way to success with balance and a deep cast, including a sturdy offensive line and strong defense that held opponents to 21.7 points a game. 3. Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy swimming turns in another banner season. In 2012, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy swimming took back the Mission League. A year later, the Tologs cemented their place in the competitive league and enjoyed their best finish in CIF Southern Section Division I since being bumped up from Division II in 2009. Sacred Heart relied on a deep roster for success a year ago, but became the front runner for most of the season in 2013, with underclass talents Kirsten Vose and Kate Herrill leading the way. The Tologs took seventh in Division I after not cracking the top 14 the previous four years. Vose reaped the highest honors of the group, with a dramatic victory in the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:02.57 for a victory by .28 of a second. She also took sixth in the 200 individual medley (2:05.63) and was also a key part of the Tologs\u2019 championship 200-medley relay team. Sacred Heart did not start the first race of the day well and was in eighth place after the first 50 yards, but made up ground down the stretch \u2013 most notably Herrill's 22.82 sprint down the final 50 \u2013 for a victory in 1:44.26. After the medley relay, Emily Balog and Katie Altmayer joined Vose and Herrill for another fourth-place finish in the 200-freestyle relay (1:36.12) later on, while Herrill improved on eighth seeds in the 50 free (23.66) and the 100 breast (1:03.81). All the success was paved in the league finals, where the Tologs won six of 11 events and set five school and three meet records. Vose, the eventual All-Area Girls' Swimmer and Valley Sun Female Athlete of the Year, won four league titles and had a hand in all three meet records. 4. Flintridge Prep cross-country doubles its pleasure and success. As the postseason wore on, it became a question of what two already storied Flintridge Prep cross-country programs could accomplish next. As was expected, the Rebels dominated the Prep League and stretched their run all the way to the national stage.\nIt started in familiar territory for the Rebels, as both the boys' and girls' squads produced individual and team Prep League champions. Individually, the brother-sister duo of Alan and Sarah Yoho turned in championship runs in 15 minutes, 18 seconds (tied for all-time league best) and 18:52, respectively. Sarah Yoho\u2019s run was particularly noteworthy as she upset two-time defending league individual champion Evan Gancedo (19:06) of Pasadena Poly. Prep swept the top-four spots \u2014 Jack Van Scoter (second, 15:46), Tyler Fong (third, 16:30) and Nikhil Poole (fourth, 16:38) \u2014 for its 21st league title over the past 22 years on the boys\u2019 side. On the other side, the Rebel girls won their first league title since 2006 with a 26-40 win over two-time reigning champion Mayfield. It was more of the same at the CIF Southern Section Division V Finals, as Flintridge Prep became the first school to sweep both titles in two years and the first to do so in the division in six years. Alan Yoho became the first-ever individual Southern Section champion in the boys' program\u2019s history with a time of 15:10, with Van Scoter taking runner-up again in 15:19. Even without the services of Sarah Yoho, the Rebels girls won a Southern Section crown after taking four of the top-10 spots, with Natalie O'Brien (fourth, 19:04), Ashley Lara (fifth, 19:11), Maia Cohen (ninth, 19:28) and Lacy Coan (10th, 19:29) filling those spots. While Prep's boys' squad fell short of its third championship with a fourth-place finish at the CIF Division V State meet, Alan Yoho became the Rebels' first individual state champion, winning in 15:11 at Fresno's Woodward Park. Van Scoter continued to run strong, too, with a third-place time of 15:41. The Rebel girls took third in consecutive seasons, led by Coan at 18th (19:40). Alan Yoho's magical runs continued, as he shed his 88th ranking at Nike Nationals and placed ninth in 15:14 at Portland Meadows Course in Portland, Ore. 5. La Ca\u00f1ada High soccer sensation Armand Bagramyan proved difficult to contain. On the field, perhaps no individual player made more of an impact than did Bagramyan, who turned in a stellar offensive 2012-13 season. According to maxpreps.com, Bagramyan netted the second-most goals in California last season in tallying 43 scores and 21 assists through 23 matches. Bagramyan totaled at least a point in each match of the season while turning hat tricks in five matches and scoring four goals in three occasions. Bagramyan\u2019s scoring prowess was enough to break La Ca\u00f1ada\u2019s previous single season record of 41 goals set by Josh Henderson in 1996. On the awards front, Bagramyan was named the All-Area Player of the Year, the All-Rio Hondo League Offensive Player of the Year, a CIF Southern Section Division V first-team selection and an Elite Soccer Report Winter All-American pick. Bagramyan, who is currently at UC Santa Barbara, led the Spartans to an 18-4-2 record, which translated into a runner-up spot in league and a CIF-SS Division V first-round playoff exit. 6. Flintridge Sacred Heart volleyball revamps and makes a deep postseason run. Year No. 2 under the leadership of coach Ernest Banaag proved a tremendous success for the Tologs. Perhaps the team\u2019s biggest accomplishment took place on one single night. The Tologs defeated visiting Harvard-Westlake, 3-1, on Oct. 24 at home in knocking off the league heavyweight and defending Mission League champion for the first time in 15 matches, which spanned seven years. The victory erased a devastating 3-0 loss at Harvard-Westlake on Oct. 8 and eventually allowed Flintridge Sacred Heart to clinch the program\u2019s first co-league title since 2006. Seeded fourth in the playoffs, Flintridge Sacred Heart did not disappoint, defeating Ayala (3-1) and Thousand Oaks (3-0) in the first two rounds before bouncing 2012 divisional finalist El Dorado in the quarterfinals, 3-2. In the semifinals, the Tologs ran into Southern Section power La Salle and fell to the top seed, 3-1, as Flintridge Sacred Heart was the only team to take a game from the Lancers in the divisional postseason. Flintridge Sacred Heart finished with a 26-5 record in reaching the semifinals for the first time since 2007. 7. La Ca\u00f1ada High baseball bounces back in big way. A year after finishing dead last within the Rio Hondo League, the Spartans\u2019 baseball program not only mattered, but thrived in 2013. Under the direction of new coach Alex Valadez, the Spartans finished with an 14-8 record and 8-4 mark in league to capture the program\u2019s first league championship since 2005. The 14 wins were also the most for the program since 2009. Only a year earlier, the Spartans were 10-14 and 2-10. Beyond the stats, though, La Ca\u00f1ada won some big games, including bumping off area rival Crescenta Valley, 6-3, in the Feb. 23 season opener, while notching league wins versus Monrovia, Temple City and San Marino. In defeating California, 4-2, on May 16 in the first round of the CIF Southern Section Division IV playoffs, La Ca\u00f1ada also won its first postseason game since 2009 and advanced for the first time to the second round since 2005. The Spartans run eventually ended, 8-5, at Sonora in the second round on May 21. 8. Flintridge Prep baseball has a historic year with new coach. It appeared as though Flintridge Prep would be involved in a transitional season in 2013. That was hardly the case. Under new coach Guillermo Gonzalez, the Rebels accomplished plenty in surprising fashion. Flintridge Prep shared the Prep League championship with Pasadena Poly and Webb for the first time since 1997. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Flintridge Prep (18-9, 9-3 in league) made plenty of noise in the CIF Southern Section Division VI postseason. Flintridge Prep posted a 14-6 opening-round home win against Santa Paula to clinch its first playoff victory since 1999. While that would have been plenty of cause to celebrate, the Rebels didn\u2019t stop there. Flintridge Prep made the long journey to Kern Valley for a second-round game and rallied from a 3-1 deficit to post a 6-3 win. In a quarterfinal game against visiting Crean Lutheran, Flintridge Prep, trailed, 3-0, going into the bottom of the seventh.

{{Calgary\u2019s Olympic ambitions have been given a boost by a city-commissioned survey.\nA new poll slated to come before the Olympic bid committee this week found 53 per cent of Calgarians surveyed support bidding on the 2026 Olympics, versus 34 per cent opposed.\nThe poll, commissioned by city manager Jeff Fielding, surveyed 500 Calgarians last month through random telephone digit dialing to establish \u201cbaseline information about citizens\u2019 attitudes and perceptions towards a potential bid for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.\u201d\nSome 13 per cent of those polled said they were undecided on whether the city should bid on the Games, and one per cent refused to answer.\nJason Ribeiro, an organizer with Yes Calgary 2026, a non-partisan group established to support a city bid, called the poll\u2019s findings \u201cincredibly promising.\u201d\n\u201cAt this stage, if I\u2019m the Olympic committee or council, I think they can feel heartened by this data,\u201d said Ribeiro.\n\u201cHeartened by the notion that not only do people believe in this city\u2019s livability, as recognized last week as being world class, but that a majority feel informed about this bid and trusting of their government.\u201d\nLast week, the Economic Intelligence Unit\u2019s annual survey ranked Calgary as the fourth most livable city in the world.\nTo ensure the data for the city poll was gathered from a representative group, quotas were set by age, gender and city quadrant of the general population age 18 or older, according to the city. Numbers from both land lines (62 per cent) and cellphones (38 per cent) were included.\nThe majority of those surveyed were aged 35 to 54.\nDespite a sample size of just 500 respondents, Ribeiro said he believes it\u2019s still representative of Calgary.\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough good evidence here to be able to use it as a good jumping off point to get at least an initial sentiment of where Calgarians are in response to this bid,\u201d said Ribeiro.\nHowever, those pushing the city to scrap the bid process believe the same poll suggests support for the Games is soft, undermined by uncertainty over economic merits, said Erin Waite, spokeswoman for the No Calgary Olympics group.\n\u201cEverybody they polled said they need to see the costs, even those who support it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yes at all costs.\u201d\nThe survey found economics were at the centre of arguments for and against the city bidding on the Games.\nAt 73 per cent, the No. 1 reason for those opposing a bid said it was because of the potential costs and taxes. Funding sources ranked as the second highest reason for opposition at 17 per cent.\nMeanwhile, 39 per cent of those who support the bid said they believe there will be a benefit to the economy. The second highest factor for those backing a city bid, at 31 per cent, is the potential to increase tourism.\nLast year, the city\u2019s bid exploration committee said hosting the Games would come with a price tag of around $4.6 billion, though council was warned earlier this year that number could climb.\nIf those supporters backing a Games bid on economic grounds realize the Olympics have traditionally had limited financial benefits for host cities, that sentiment would likely dry up, said Waite.\n\u201cWhat happens when (supporters) understand it doesn\u2019t help the economy except for a two-week blip? That there aren\u2019t even meaningful jobs created?\u201d she said.\nNot included in the survey, added Waite, was the prospect of some marquee events being held in other locales.\n\u201cIf hockey and curling would be in Edmonton, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d have a happy response,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think BidCo still has a lot of work to do.\u201d\nBut Ribeiro said a potential economic windfall for Calgary is exactly why backing a bid makes sense.\n\u201cThese are really economic-generated reasons for supporting a bid. So the notion that people feel as though that\u2019s not on the side of supporting this effort for winning the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games I think is simply not accurate based on this data,\u201d said Ribeiro.\nAmong supporters of the bid, the poll found 51 per cent said they do not have any concerns about a potential Olympic bid, while 33 per cent said they were concerned over costs and taxes.\n\u201cI think the moment the specific financial information gets released, I do think it will nudge people even further toward the yes column, who are maybe undecided at this point,\u201d said Ribeiro.\n\u201cThey certainly would not be pursuing this if it wasn\u2019t in our best social and economic interest. That is matched by what we\u2019re seeing in the data.\u201d\nYes Calgary 2026 will host three events across the city on Sept. 8 to showcase the support and enthusiasm for an Olympics bid.\n\u201cThese events will provide attendees with information about the candidature process, stories from both amateur and medal-winning athletes, and fun activities for the whole family,\u201d said Ribeiro.\nThe city is set to undertake an official plebiscite on hosting the Olympics on Nov. 13.\nThe survey, conducted from July 23 to 29, is considered accurate within 4.38 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\najunker@postmedia.com\nOn Twitter: @JunkerAnna\n}}

{{Joe Utichi contributes to Deadline\u2019s UK coverage.\nHas The Hunger Games triggered Americans\u2019 interest in archery? The bow-and-arrow sport is NBC\u2019s No. 1 cable ratings winner, the network says, averaging 1.5M daytime viewers. NBC\u2019s coverage of the London Olympics is breaking records and an upswing in interest in archery given the popularity of the film is serendipitous.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the Hunger Games phenomenon\u201d, NBC research exec Alan Wurtzel said. He likened its popularity to the surprise interest in curling events of the Vancouver winter games two years ago. \u201cThe numbers for archery have been nothing less than huge.\u201d Bigger, even, than numbers for basketball but individual Team USA games in that sport still perform better.\nIn The Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Katniss Everdeen learned archery so she can provide for her starved family. It\u2019s not impossible to believe that there\u2019s a good amount of crossover interest from fans of the movie. In the wake of its release, sports shops all over the US reported a rise in sales of archery equipment, while ranges were said to be overflowing with teens. Lawrence was trained by five-time Team USA Olympic archer Khatuna Lorig, who scored the first perfect bullseye of her career at the London games, taking out a camera embedded in the board in the process.\n}}

{{South Korean President Moon Jae-in shook hands with Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as geopolitics and sporting endeavor merged at the opening of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\nMinutes into a spectacular opening ceremony, Moon greeted a number of world leaders including Kim Yo Jong and North Korea's 90-year-old ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam, the head of the North's Olympic delegation.\nKim Yo Jong is the first member of the North's ruling dynasty to visit the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Even months ago, such an encounter would have been unthinkable.\nThe two figures from opposite sides of a divided Korea watched as athletes from their respective nations marched together under a unified flag. Mike Pence, the US Vice President, who has been vocal in his criticism of North Korea in the runup to the Games, sat meters away.\nThe presence of Kim, who was promoted to the country's Politburo, the senior body of North Korea's communist party, as an alternate member last year, represents a hugely significant move in the thawing of relations between the neighbors.\nAccording to diplomatic sources, there is a \"good chance\" Kim will invite Moon to visit Pyongyang \"sometime this year.\"\nWhile the sources say \"nothing is final,\" a visit by Moon to North Korea would be the first time a South Korean President has stepped foot in the country since 2007.\nThat invitation could come when Moon and Kim will meet for lunch at the Blue House on Saturday, after the meeting was confirmed by a South Koeran presidential person.\nA potential date could be August 15, the day Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation in 1945, a holiday marked by both Koreas.\nBoth watched on as the united Korea team entered the arena under the unification flag. The entire ceremony drew on themes of peace and unity.\nThe Korean Unification Flag features a blue silhouette of the peninsula and outlying islands. The two countries have marched under the flag before, in rare shows of unity, first at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, and at a number of sporting events since. It was most recently used at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy.\n}}

{{The provincial government has not adequately disclosed the financial risks associated with the 2010 Olympics and the costs of staging the Games could \"escalate considerably,\" according to B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle.\n\"I share my predecessors' view that the full cost of staging the Games should include a number of items that are not included in the official budget,\" he writes in a letter to legislature speaker Bill Barisoff.\nThe government says it will spend about $600 million on the Games but a 2006 report from former auditor-general Arn van Iersel put the true cost at around $2.5 billion. That estimate included Sea to Sky Highway improvements and Canada Line costs the government feels are unrelated to staging the games.\n\"While the details of specific issues may have shifted to some extent since the Office's last report \u2014 cost estimates remain, to great extent, a moving target \u2014 the underlying fundamental differences of opinion between government and my Office have not,\" Doyle says in the letter.\nHe was expected to release a full report on the government's games costs this week but felt it was not necessary to detail yet again ground that has already been covered.\nHis only recommendation is that government expand its definition of Games-related costs to include all items that are \"reasonably attributable\" to hosting the Games and report publicly on the risks associated with them.\nHe said the Vancouver Olympic organizing committee's revised budget, due early next year, presents an ideal opportunity to update this disclosure.\nDoyle credited Vanoc for having most competition venues near completion.\n\"While costs have exceeded the original budget, I am pleased to report that, on the whole, (Vanoc) has done a good job of managing the timely completion of venue construction under their control,\" he says.\nbconstantineau@vancouversun.com\n}}

{{Updated\nThe Olympic Stadium and the Sydney Football Stadium will be demolished and rebuilt in a $2 billion overhaul signed off by New South Wales Cabinet.\nWork at the Sydney Football Stadium site at Moore Park is expected to start next year, followed by the Homebush Olympic stadium in 2019\nSenior government sources described Thursday morning's Cabinet meeting as \"robust\" with some ministers, frustrated at the length of time it had taken to reach a decision, expressing concerns the handling of the issue had been damaging.\nIt is understood some also raised concerns about the $2.3 billion price tag, up from former premier Mike Baird's original estimate of $1.6 billion.\nThe package also includes the cost of rebuilding Parramatta Stadium.\nThe rebuilt Sydney Football Stadium's capacity is expected to be 45,000 people while the Olympic stadium will hold between 75,000 and 80,000 people.\nThe decision is expected to be announced on Friday and brings to an end a saga that dragged out for more than 18 months since Mr Baird first detailed his proposal.\nThat plan would have seen the Olympic Stadium reconfigured to a rectangular venue at a cost of $700 million ahead of a refurbishment of the Sydney Football Stadium.\nWhile the proposal received strong support from the NRL, there has since been furious lobbying by the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, who control the Sydney Football Stadium, as well as the Australian Rugby Union and Sydney FC to rebuild the Moore Park venue first.\nSports Minister Stuart Ayres backed that option and has spent almost two years tying himself into knots advocating various positions that would get it over the line.\nBut there has been fierce opposition from some members of Mr Ayres' own cabinet, with some scratching their heads as to why a stadium that was built as a state of the art venue for the Sydney Olympics less than 20 years ago should need such a complete overhaul so quickly.\nOpposition Leader Luke Foley supported the rebuilding of the Olympic stadium but said the work at Moore Park was a waste of money.\n\"I've always said west before east because that's where the people are,\" he said.\n\"They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a white elephant, on a stadium that won't host grand finals, State of Origins, Bledisloe Cups or the biggest Socceroos qualifiers.\n\"Why are we doing this?

{{Daniel Keatings' battle with injury and form came to a crushing conclusion when he was left out of Britain's artistic gymnastics team for the Olympics. His place was taken by 19-year-old Sam Oldham, the British high-bar champion from Nottingham who will make his debut at the Games.\nKeatings had been a regular member of the team since competing alongside Louis Smith in Beijing four years ago. In 2009, he became the first British gymnast to win an all-round medal at a world championships and picked up European gold on pommel the following year. But his preparations were hit in April when he injured ankle ligaments and a strong performance at the British championships \u2013 where he won five medals, including two gold \u2013 was not enough to secure him a place against Oldham, whose all-round performances have been attracting notice since he won Junior Olympic gold two years ago.\n\"I wish the team all the best and I'll be supporting them all the way and I hope they achieve some great things,\" Keatings said on Twitter. He also observed that although he had achieved many of the selection targets \u2013 \"more than most of the team\" \u2013 it had not been enough. \"It's pretty funny tho I got 2 golds and 3 bronze last weekend in trial but still didn't get selected,\" he tweeted. He said that he planned to \"smash up the next four years\" and compete in Rio.\n\"The decisions were tough ones to make,\" said Tim Jones, the performance director. \"We have a big stock of gymnasts now that are capable of producing on the world stage and Daniel's one of those but competition for places is really tough. It's not as simple as an objective sport like athletics or swimming where you simply go down the rankings\u2026 it's all about making sure the jigsaw fits together.\"\nRebecca Tunney was the not-so-surprise selection to the women's team, after the 15-year-old took the all-round title at the British Championships a fortnight ago on her senior debut, and will be the youngest British athlete. Tunney competes alongside 19-year-old Hannah Whelan, who won bronzes on both beam and floor at this year's European Championships, three-time Commonwealth champion Imogen Cairns, and Jenny Pinches, the British beam champion.\nBut it is Beth Tweddle's presence at her third Games that will most hearten the team, who refer to her as their \"mother hen\". The inclusion of Britain's most successful gymnast of all time was by no means assured, after needing keyhole surgery on her knee in April. \"Everyone knows that I've had a few injury worries,\" she said, \"so finally to get that phone call was a massive relief.\" She will compete for an individual medal on her favourite apparatus, the uneven bars, but will not enter the floor finals as she had originally hoped.\nTrampolinist Kat Driscoll, ranked world No1 at the end of last year, was duly confirmed as the only home competitor in the event \u2013 and, perhaps, Britain's best hope of a gymnastics gold. The rhythmic gymnastics team, who were granted their place at the Games after a successful appeal against their own governing body, will be captained by Rachel Smith, and Francesca Jones will compete in the individual event.\nMen's artistic team Louis Smith (age 23), Daniel Purvis (21), Kristian Thomas (23), Max Whitlock (19), Sam Oldham (19). Women's artistic team Beth Tweddle (27), Rebecca Tunney (15), Hannah Whelan (20), Imogen Cairns (23), Jennifer Pinches (18). Rhythmic team Rachel Smith (captain, 19), Georgina Cassar (18), Jade Faulkner (18), Lynne Hutchison (17), Louisa Pouli (22), Francesca Fox (20). Individual rhythmic Francesca Jones (21). Trampoline Katherine Driscoll (26).\n\u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2012. The original said that Daniel Keatings had missed Olympic selection despite \"helping the men's team to European gold two months ago\". Keatings, who was recovering from an injury, was not in the 2012 European championships team.\n}}

{{The total cost of building, striping back and then transforming the Olympic Stadium in to a new home for West Ham football club has broken the \u00a3700million barrier\nAccording to The Guardian, the costs of converting the Populous-designed stadium into a multi-purpose venue which is to be shared by the East London football club and UK athletics has risen to \u00a3272million, meaning the total costs - including the original construction - now stand at \u00a3701million.\nWhen London bid for the right to hold the 2012 Olympics in 2005, the stadium was originally priced at \u00a3280million. That figure rose to \u00a3429million in the run up to the Games.\nAt current levels of spending the new home for West Ham FC will cost marginally less than Wembley, which is the most expensive stadium in the UK.\nThe announcement comes as the last contracts to transform the stadium have been signed. The transformation of the former Olympic venue has been handled by the delivery authority for the Olympic Park, the London Legacy Delivery Corporation (LLDC)\nOnce complete, the reconfigurated roof will be the largest cantilevered roof in the world and 84m wide at it\u2019s furthest point.\nWest Ham are expected to move into the new home in 2016, though work on the stadium will pause later this year when it will host five matches for the Rugby World Cup.\nThe extra costs are not expected to delay the construction schedule.\n}}

{{It took 20 years, but I finally had an opportunity to apologize to legendary Australian swim coach Don Talbot as we watched a training session at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\nTalbot and Englishman Deryk Snelling shared the head coaching duties for Canada\u2019s swim team at the 1976 Olympic Games and Talbot had high hopes for the women\u2019s team led by 14-year-old Nancy Garapick, a former world-record holder in the 200-metre backstroke.\nIn the days leading up to the Montreal Games, Talbot boldly predicted that Canada would win four gold medals. Talbot expected a couple from Garapick and had high hopes for Cheryl Gibson in the freestyle events and the Canadian relay teams.\nIt was not to be.\nWhile the United States was dominating the men\u2019s swimming events as expected, the East German women powered their way to 10 gold medals, six silver and one bronze.\nThe Canadian women captured one silver and five bronze medals and, with each passing day, I needled Talbot about his prediction. When there were three races remaining on the schedule, I delivered the cheap shot that I came to regret.\n\u201cDon, do you still think four gold are possible?\u201d I asked.\nThe reality is that the Canadian swimmers would have come close to fulfilling Talbot\u2019s prophecy if the competition had been held on a level swimming pool.\nBut the East German women, who would dominate the international swimming scene into the 1980s, were powered by a systemic doping program that involved 10,000 women athletes. Many would develop lifelong health problems and a series of lawsuits in the past decade resulted in 167 athletes receiving compensation from the German government for the harm they suffered as a result of the doping.\nWhile none of the athletes failed drug tests in Montreal, there was no shortage of rumours about the East Germans. American Shirley Babashoff was the most vocal. When she noted that \u201cat least we look like women\u201d she was painted as a sore loser and nicknamed Surly Shirley.\nThe East Germans pleaded ignorance, and one official answered questions about the swimmers having deep voices by saying: \u201cWe came here to swim, not to sing.\u201d\nOver the years, there have been several attempts to strip the East German swimmers of their medals, but no action was taken. Swimming World magazine, which has campaigned for retroactive disciplinary action against the East Germans, has revised the results from the Montreal Games and, when you exclude the East German swimmers, Canada has three gold medals \u2014 one shy of Talbot\u2019s prediction \u2014 as well as six silver and three bronze.\nThe big winner would have been Garapick, who traded the world record for the 200-metre backstroke with East German Birgit Treiber in the year leading up to the Games. Ulrike Richter and Treiber finished one-two in the 100-metre and 200-metre backstroke events with Garapick winning the bronze in both races. Take away the East Germans and Canada would have swept the podium in the 100-metre backstroke with Wendy Hogg and Gibson following Garapick to the finish line.\nGibson would have won Canada\u2019s other gold. She finished second to East German Ulrike Tauber in the 400-metre individual medley.\nAnne Jardin, who swam out of the Pointe Claire Aquatic Club, grabbed bronze medals in the 4\u00d7100-metre freestyle relay and 4\u00d7100-metre medley relay, and they both would have been upgraded to silver. Montrealer Robin Corsiglia was also a member of the medley team.\nWendy Quirk, who swam out of the Pointe Claire Club, didn\u2019t win any medals, but she should have grabbed a pair of freestyle bronze.\nRelated\nphickey@postmedia.com\n}}

{{Of course, there is one multi-national entity that no longer competes as such for the simple reason that it no longer exists: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which more often than not topped the medal standings once they entered the games in Helsinki in 1952 with the Cyrillic abbreviation \"CCCP\" emblazoned on their uniforms. But if the constituent elements of the dissolved Soviet empire are toted up in the aggregate and added to Russia's independently strong showing, the medals title would be theirs once again. With 23 golds, 19 silvers and 40 bronzes, for a total of 82 medals tallied by Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Lithuania, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Latvia, Estonia, Tajikistan and Moldova, the once and no longer USSR could claim a total of 164 medals (47 golds, 44 silvers, 73 bronzes) far in front of the United States's total 104, and also edging the US in golds 47 to 46. Not too bad for a region that is habitually portrayed as struggling with political dysfunction and economic instability. But whatever Vladimir Putin's neo-imperial ambitions for his truncated Russia, we won't be seeing any such reassembled sporting empire, whether branded \"CCCP\" or not.\nWhat of the showings made more \"relevant\" and up-to-date multi-national entities? The Arab League and African Union (whose memberships somewhat overlap) would not make much of a mark in the medals tables if competing as units, with 33 medals (11 gold, 12 silver, 10 bronze) for the African Union and only 12 (2 gold, 3 silver, 7 bronze) for the Arab League. The 27-member European Union fares much better, with Great Britain, Germany, and France (a notably well balanced 34 total medals, 11 gold, 11 silver, 12 bronze) leading the way to a dominant overall EU haul of 305 medals\u2014almost 150 ahead even of a mythically reconstituted Soviet Union and nearly three times that of the non-mythical United States\u201492 golds, 104 silvers, 109 bronzes. But before announcing that we are entering into a renewed European Era, limiting the tally to the 10-member Eurozone\u2014which has, of course, carried the cause of a truly united Europe to its greatest extent, and paying a stiff economic price for doing so\u2014reduces that result to 154 total medals (40 gold, 58 silver, 56 bronzes). And it has to be said that the ejection or withdrawal of Greece (2 bronzes) would hardly register on this Olympics balance sheet at all. And ditto Portugal (1 silver).\nFinally, what of the \"BRICS,\" the omnipresent (in punditry at least) specter of a Brazil, Russia, India, and China poised to overturn the Euro-centric economic order that has ruled the world ever since Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1498? Well, Russia is holding its own and China is moving ahead, but India was a bust in London (6 medals total, 2 silver and 4 bronze) and Brazil (17 medals in all, 3 gold, 5 silver, 9 bronze) was no threat to the established sports world order. With the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio, perhaps a host country bounce will push Brazil up the medals tables. Added to Russia and China, a resurgent Brazil may yet make the BRICS an athletic force\u2014assuming that anything can be expected from India.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{{Beijing will meet its pledge to have clean air for the Summer Olympics, an environmental official said Tuesday, downplaying worries the city's notorious smog will overshadow the Games.\nState Environmental Protection Administration Vice Minister Zhang Lijun said measures to cut pollution in Beijing and surrounding areas are being intensified to ensure the city's air is up to the required standards.\nZhang's claim came a day after world marathon record holder Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia said he would skip the long-distance running event in Beijing because of the city's poor air quality.\nConsidered the world's best distance runner, the 34-year-old Gebrselassie \u2014 who has asthma \u2014 fears his health could be damaged by running through the streets of the Chinese capital.\nChina's double-digit economic growth has come with a surge in heavily polluting industries such as manufacturing and energy.

We can deliver on our commitment,\" Zhang said a news conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature.\nThe measures include requiring Beijing and Tianjin cities and Hebei province to temporarily suspend emissions from some of their most heavily polluting plants, which include cement, steel and coke factories.\nThe provinces of Shanxi and Shandong, along with the huge Inner Mongolia region, will also be required to restrict their coal-fired emissions, Zhang said.\nZhang said he expects that \"by June, we will complete all tasks necessary\" to ensure the city will have the required clear air.\nTo satisfy commitments made in 2001 in its Olympic bid, Beijing will be required to show that it meets international standards on four major pollutants \u2014 sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, inhalable particles and chemical oxygen demand, a measure of water pollution.\nParticles a problem\nRegular monitoring of air quality has shown the city has already met the standard for three of the four measures. Only inhalable particles remains below the acceptable level, Zhang said.\nConcerns about the capital's pollution level have dominated preparations by international athletes for the games. Several countries have decided to station their athletes outside China \u2014 in some cases in Japan or Korea \u2014 for training.\nDarryl Seibel, a spokesman for the United States Olympics Committee, said none of the 600 U.S. athletes competing in the Games is planning to withdraw because of the air quality.

{{CLEVELAND, May 6, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Olympic Steel, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZEUS), a national metals service center, today announced plans for approximately 300,000 square feet of additional warehouse, processing, and office space with the recent purchase of a facility and leases of new properties.\nIn April 2011, the Company completed the purchase of its previously announced facility located on United States Steel Corporation's Gary Works site in Gary, Indiana. This new location, which totals approximately 177,000 square feet, will house our new temper mill and cut-to-length line, and is expected to become operational by year-end 2011. In April 2011, Olympic Steel completed leasing agreements for approximately 43,000 square feet of warehouse and staging space in Kansas City, Missouri, a new foothold in the important farm belt, and 8,000 square feet of additional warehouse space in Quincy, Washington. The Company also intends to execute a lease agreement in the second quarter of 2011 for approximately 57,000 square feet of warehouse space in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Kansas City facility will serve as a satellite for our existing operations in Bettendorf, Iowa, and is part of our temper mill product expansion strategy. The Quincy and St. Paul locations will further support our operations and customers currently served by our Minneapolis operations.\nAdditionally, Olympic Steel entered into a lease agreement in April 2011 to operate approximately 15,000 square feet of warehouse space in Monterrey, Mexico. Our physical presence in Mexico will augment our long-existing sales efforts there. Finally, to extend the Company's international reach, the Company has leased sales office space in Miami, Florida to support and grow existing markets in South Florida, the Caribbean, and South and Central America.\n\"We are pleased to execute on our geographic growth strategy, and provide more timely delivery options and a greater range of services to our customers,\" stated Michael D. Siegal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"It is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our national supply chain.

{{In a joint NBC\/Quokka Ventures deal announced this week, the company plans to provide up-close-and-personal coverage of the Olympics in a bid to raise its profile and boost traffic. But Quokka's agreement with the network is no slam dunk, according to analysts, who point out that most production costs fall to the sports company, and any potential profits must be shared with NBC.\nNBC has also signed an agreement with the U.S. Olympic Committee to sell official USOC and Sydney Olympic merchandise through a new online store in the spring.\nThe deal comes as a cloud continues to hang over online coverage of the Olympics.\nAnalysts said the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned all Net ventures from streaming or allowing people to download video clips of the games, which has caused an uproar among news sites hoping to cover the event.\nTom Newell, general manager for NBC\/Quokka Ventures, said the IOC is still negotiating Web video broadcast rules, which appear to be loosening. Last week, content distribution company Axient Communications announced a deal with NBC to use its technology to deliver broadcast video of the summer games to the United States from Australia.\nNewell said the IOC has granted NBC\/Quokka Ventures permission to broadcast NBC coverage over the Web to residential broadband users.\nRegardless of the risks of its Olympics coverage, Quokka hopes the event will drive up its traffic numbers, which need help.\nQuokka's Web sites gives fans a taste of adventure sports such as sailing, auto racing and mountain climbing. While sports sites are among the Web's most popular destinations, Quokka has lagged the field despite its innovative offerings.\nAccording to Media Metrix's digital media report for the month of June, ESPN's network of Web sites led among sports destinations on the Web with 5.3 million unique visitors, while CBS SportsLine had 3.9 million, and CNNsi.com had 2.2 million.\nBy contrast, Quokka had only 247,000 unique visitors for the month of June.\nNevertheless, Quokka believes its programming is sufficiently different to draw repeat customers from the Olympics offering.\n\"We're about delivering the experience of the athlete to the user,\" Newell said. \"I think today a lot of sport Web sites are more like electronic newspapers: They'll give you a 600- or 800-word article, a small photo, and a few statistics, and that's it. We try to get you closer to the athlete.\"\nEven if Quokka succeeds in drawing new traffic through its Olympics coverage, analysts said the results may not translate into profits.\n\"We still have to worry about the aftermath of the deal,\" said Idil Cakim, an analyst for Cyber Dialogue. \"If Quokka gets more traffic or considerably more traffic than they used to get before...(and) Quokka is also sucking up all the production costs in this...it's all on them to figure out ways to monetize on this experience.\"\n}}

{{Courtesy of Will Leer Will Leer, center, is primed for competition in the 1,500-meter event.\nA gaggle of Minnesotans are bound for Eugene, Ore., and the U.S. Olympic track and field trials this weekend. It is, perhaps, the most glamorous and competitive selection meet of all in this decisive pre-Beijing season.\nBut Will Leer didn\u2019t have to pack one bag or search for his raincoat to fend off the Pacific Northwest mist.\n\u201cRain, rain, rain,\u201d Leer said during a phone call from Oregon this week, describing the predominant weather pattern.\nLeer, of Minnetonka, has been living in Eugene for the past 10 months, training with the fabled Oregon Track Club Elite, and having the kind of breakthrough season that puts him in the mix for one of the centerpiece Olympic events \u2013 the men\u2019s 1,500-meters.\nHe\u2019s coach by Frank Gagliano, \u201ca longtime legend,\u201d as Leer put it, for developing distance runners, including former Richfield and Georgetown Olympian Steve Holman. Nike backs Leer and helps him with rent, health insurance and a stipend. (It\u2019s not unlike Team USA Minnesota, which will be sending five athletes to Eugene, including strong 10,000-meter candidate Katie McGregor.)\nOf course, no one is a shoo-in at the U.S. track trials. Many say it\u2019s more competitive than the Olympics because of the depth of the U.S. track community.\nLeer\u2019s path to the trials was unusual. He played soccer in high school \u2013 a sport that laid his base for foot speed \u2013 but didn\u2019t run a full cross country season until college. He was a solid high school athlete, breaking records at Minnetonka High, but never won a state title.\nThen, he went off to academically elite Pomona College in California, not exactly a sports power. Still, at that NCAA Division III level is where he began to find his elite athletic voice.\nBreakthrough race came close to home\nIronically, a breakthrough race came in Minnesota, 50 miles from his home. He won his first NCAA title, the indoor mile, in Northfield.\n\u201cI only ran the meet because it was at St. Olaf,\u201d he said, eager to have friends and family watch him. \u201cI wound up winning, which was a surprise to me.\u201d\nAnd that victory \u201ctook me on a wave\u201d that he\u2019s been riding ever since.\nAs a senior, he won the 1,500 and 5,000 at the national Division III championships. Last year, he finished 10th in the nation at the USA Track & Field nationals, with all the big boys, like U.S. mile record holder Alan Webb and Bernard Lagat.\nThis year, he\u2019s posted a time of 3:38.11, again among the top 10 in the nation. You need to finish in the top three to make the Olympic team.\nEarlier this year, he broke the four-minute-mile barrier and hasn\u2019t been slower in the distance since.\nMostly, he\u2019s been picking up on the spirit of Eugene.\n\u201cThey love their track and field here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a sort of energy here at Hayward Field that I don\u2019t think you get in other places in the country.\u201d\nHayward Field is the Fenway Park of track and field. It\u2019s where distance-running superstar Steve Prefontaine made his mark.\nThere are three rounds in the trials, beginning July 3, with the second round on July 4 and the finals slated as the last race of the trials on July 6. The 1,500 remains the iconic distance race. Leer thinks that the three-part series of races plays to his training regimen and overall strength.\nBut then he added this note: \u201cI think that there\u2019s magic to happen at Hayward Field, and I think I have just as much chance of being on the receiving end of that magic as anyone.\u201d\nHmmmm. Magic.\nLet\u2019s hold him to that.\nLots and lots of others \u2026\nPhoto by Victah Sailer Katie McGregor\nSome other key Minnesotans to watch include Katie McGregor, the 10,000-meter standout who runs with Team USA Minnesota, coached by Augsburg\u2019s head coach Dennis Barker.

{{Amnesty International has released a report which condemns the Chinese government for breaking their promise to improve human rights and for violating the core values of the Olympics.\nJust 10 days left before the Olympics, Amnesty International published a report entitled \u201cThe Olympics countdown\u2014broken promises,\u201d which compares four areas of conduct the Communist regime\u2019s to the values of the Olympics.\n\"By continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights, the Chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the Games seven years ago,\" said Roseann Rife, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific deputy director at a press conference in Hong Kong. \"The Chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the Games. They must release all imprisoned peaceful activists, allow foreign and national journalists to report freely, and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty.\"\nThe categories covered in the report include China\u2019s persecution of human rights activists, detention without trial, censorship, and the death penalty. The document points out that human rights in China have deteriorated leading up to the Olympics. It also points out that activists and journalists in particular are in danger due to China being granted the Olympic Games.\n\"It is time for President Bush to raise his voice clearly and definitively to promote human rights in China,\" said T. Kumar, Asia advocacy director at Amnesty International USA. \"Not only do Chinese human rights activists need his direct support, but a failure to speak out will send the message that the United States finds it acceptable to hold the Olympic Games in a repressive atmosphere.\"\nIn 2001, during the time when China had been granted the rights to host the 2008 Olympic Games, Wang Wei, Secretary General of the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee made a statement about the changes that China would make with the Olympics. \"We will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to China,\u201d said Wei. \u201cWe are confident that the Games coming to China not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions, including education, health and human rights.\"\nDespite these promises, the new Amnesty International report shows that China is still riddled with human rights violations. Covered are China\u2019s detention practices which include \u201cRe-education Through Labor\u201d and \u201cEnforced Drug Rehabilitation,\u201d which have been set to help ensure that activists are nowhere to be found during the Olympic Games.\nMany political prisoners and prisoners of conscience still remain detained throughout China, with some of the better known ones being heavily monitored by police or put under house arrest. Also, the Communist regime\u2019s casual use of the death penalty was also addressed. There are 68 crimes in China that can be punishable by death, including drug-related and economic offenses.\n}}

{{From grumbles about long coach journeys to snaps of the Olympic Village, athletes are having their say like never before\nAny lingering scepticism over claims that London 2012 would prove the first proper social media Olympics was swiftly, if unwittingly, dispelled by the American hurdler Kerron Clement on Monday.\nWeary and, by the sound of things, perhaps in need of a comfort break, Clement took to Twitter to bemoan the fact that the coach he was on was taking an awfully long time to find its way from the airport to the athletes' village.\n\"Um, so we've been lost on the road for 4 hrs. Not a good first impression London,\" he wrote. \"Athletes are sleepy, hungry and need to pee. Could we get to the Olympic Village please?\"\nAlthough his plaintive observations were quickly seized on by the media as further proof of Olympic teething troubles, they also revealed the unprecedented ease with which competitors can now express their anger, joy and disappointment.\nAlthough the Beijing Games hardly went unremarked upon on Facebook and Twitter, the past four years have seen an explosion in the sites' use, be it personal, professional or corporate.\nThe former Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent has used his Twitter account (20,531 followers) to provide a little historical context and to take the occasional pop at the naysayers.\n\"The cycle of any Olympics is a period of intense scrutiny in 10 days before OC. Even Sydney 'the best Games ever' (deserved title) got pasted,\" ran one tweet. Another was even more terse: \"Dear Vancouver 2010, Beijing 2008 etc \u2013 see? we told you \u2013 UK media PLC will kick the crap out of our own Olympics too.\"\nCurrent British Olympians have so far been a little less combative in their 140-character communiques. Tom Daley and Rebecca Adlington \u2013 who between them have more than 320,000 followers \u2013 have used Twitter to post pictures from inside the athletes' village. Daley's snap shows a room decorated with balloons and good luck cards (not to mention a cuddly Pride the Lion guarding his pillow); Adlington's, meanwhile, reveals a talent for patriotic paper-chain manufacturing.\nSocial media have also furnished sportspeople from all over the world with a quick and convenient way to thank the sponsors who have bankrolled them. They had until Wednesday to make their gratitude felt: from the Games period of 18 July to 15 August, competitors are banned from pushing personal brands and, like all those who attend the Games, they are not allowed to post video or audio clips that would tread on the toes of the official broadcasters.\nA brief and unscientific poll conducted in the rainy and still sparsely populated athletes' village this week showed that British and US hopefuls are not alone in embracing Facebook pages and Twitter feeds \u2013 although it did reveal a sharp linguistic divide when it comes to who favours which social media network and why.\nWhat did Ola Sesay, a long jumper from Sierra Leone who was loping across the village plaza with her colleague Ibrahim Turay, make of suggestions that London 2012 is the first true social media Games?\n\"Definitely, definitely,\" she said, nodding at the question and then at Turay.\n\"We were just in the mall trying to get a laptop or iPad so that he can use his Facebook.\"\nSesay, 33, said the network was her way of keeping in touch with those at home.\n\"I use Facebook a lot, mostly just to communicate with my family and give them updates on how I'm going and how my training's going,\" she said.\nHer view was echoed by Erislandy Sav\u00f3n, a 21-year-old super-heavyweight boxer from Cuba.\n\"The internet's really important because it's a way of staying in touch with your family and friends \u2013 and with some other competitors in other countries,\" he said. \"But I don't use Twitter; only Facebook and email. All my teammates are on Facebook, too.\"\nThe preference for Facebook over Twitter appears more pronounced in non-English speaking countries.\n\"We use Facebook much more because Twitter is a little more Anglophone,\" explained Kouassi Brou, a competitor in the men's 50m freestyle from Ivory Coast.\nLike many other Olympians, Brou uses social media to keep in touch with those at home and, like them, he admits to being slightly addicted to updating his status so they don't miss any aspect of his time in London.\n\"I had some connection problems, but I managed to get my phone hooked up yesterday and since then I swear I haven't stopped tweeting and going on Facebook and posting photos,\" he said.\nAs Kerron Clement's coach tweet \u2013 not to mention its deathless follow-up, \"In Wales. I'm so loving this city and I just arrived\" \u2013 demonstrated, American athletes have a natural affinity for social media.\nShea Buckner and Peter Varellas, a pair of attackers from the US water polo team, confirmed they were both avid and adept social networkers. \"We use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,\" said Buckner, 25.\n\"We mostly do it from our cellphones and we're following maybe a handful of other athletes.\"\nOther athletes? Were they ever tempted to harness technology to ignoble ends and indulge in a bit of pre-competition psychological warfare?\nBoth laughed and shook their heads before bowling off towards the accommodation blocks at great speed.\n}}

{{When the owner of the U.S. Gymnastics Training Center in Aliso Viejo decided to sell, Eduard Azarian saw the realization of a dream two decades old.\n\u201cThat was my dream for the last 20 years,\u201d Azarian said.\nBeing involved in the sport since he was 6 years old, Azarian is no stranger to gymnastics, or to the business of gymnastics.\nHe competed in the sport for about 15 years, becoming an 11-time national champion in the former Soviet Union and eventually an Olympic champion in 1980.\nHis father was a three-time Olympic champion, Azarian said, and his mother was a two-time national champion.\nHis father also has his own gym in Armenia, which exposed Azarian to how a gym should be run successfully.\nAzarian began looking at purchasing the gym about a year ago and the sale became final on Oct. 31, and with it, he said he is stepping into the next logical place of his gymnastics career. The gym is now called the Azarian U.S. Gymnastics Training Center.\n\u201cI felt like I can do a lot more for the community than just being a coach,\u201d Azarian said.\nAfter practicing the sport, Azarian turned to coaching in 1993, after an old teammate lured him into visiting the United States and then attaining a work visa. His friend invited him for a vacation, and instead took him to see the owner of a gym in Redlands.\n\u201cThe owner said, \u2018what can I do to make you stay and coach?'\u201d Azarian said.\nAfter some hesitation, Azarian agreed, but it took about a year and a half for him to attain his working visa.\n\u201cBy the time I came and everything was fine, the place went bankrupt,\u201d Azarian said.\nHe soon began coaching in Van Nuys, attained his green card and then his citizenship.\nAt first he was hesitant to stay in the United States and thought about returning to Armenia. With his new gym, Azarian admits his stay in the United States is a lot more permanent now.\n\u201cNothing is permanent in this world, but there are 500 kids in this gym,\u201d Azarian said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn my head on them.\u201d\nThat includes the 22-member boy\u2019s team that followed him to Aliso Viejo.\nThe programs that existed in the gym before he bought the place will remain intact, Azarian said. However, he eventually wants to expand the programs available to students, including a cheerleading program, martial arts program, and a physical education program, to assist those who are home- schooled.\nAzarian plans to make the transition from coach to gym owner, where he will oversee the programs provided.\nYet coaching is not something he isn\u2019t willing to let go of quite yet. He plans to continue coaching the boys\u2019 team, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about our kids,\u201d Azarian said.\nThe Fountain Valley resident is also looking into moving to Aliso Viejo in order to avoid the long commute, since he spends about 12 hours at the gym per day, he said.\nThe gym has about 20 coaches, and offers classes anywhere from beginners to competitive training. Tuition is paid on a monthly basis.\nFor more information, call (949) 455-1020.\nContact the writer: shernandez@ ocregister.com or (949) 454-7309A\n}}

{{BEIJING (AFP) - Chinese Internet users on Sunday mocked state media for mistakenly reporting Istanbul would host the 2020 Olympic Games, the latest in a series of gaffes by the government-backed press.\nXinhua News Agency reported that Istanbul had won, while state television ran a headline during a live broadcast saying \"Tokyo eliminated\".\nTokyo was the eventual winner. Both reports were later withdrawn, but continued to circulate in Internet postings.\n\"They made fools of themselves,\" said Yan Tao on Sina Weibo, a microblog service which is China's equivalent of Twitter.\nXinhua apparently mistook a vote by International Olympic Committee members to decide whether Istanbul or Madrid would advance in the voting after a first-round tie, which the Turkish city won.\n\"Liars must be held accountable, otherwise it's not fair,\" said another who gave the name McMonkey, referring to an on-going government crackdown on people who spread rumours on the Internet.\nIn another case, the People's Daily newspaper last year reported North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been named 2012's \"Sexiest Man Alive\", after treating a spoof award by satirical US website \"The Onion\" as genuine.\nBut some of the Internet comments in China, whose capital Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Games, had an anti-Japanese tone as the two countries are locked in a territorial dispute.\n\"It's an international joke to let this country host the Olympics,\" said one under the name Kid Green.\n\"Hope they can settle the matter of the Diaoyu Islands and 'comfort women', admit the massacre and face history.\"\nBoth Beijing and Tokyo claim islands in the East China Sea, called Diaoyus by China and the Senkakus by Japan, which administers them.\nWartime history also remains a sore point between the neighbours, including the 1937 \"Nanjing Massacre\" and the use of women from China and other countries in military brothels during World War II.\n}}

{{Bubba Watson this week unveiled a jetpack golf cart that can climb up to 3,000 feet and reach a speed of 50 mph.\nAnd who says this sport is as out-of-date as the last remaining can of Jolt Cola?\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just boring people,\u201d Watson told the Golf Channel. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun with the game. We\u2019re coming up with innovations. Hopefully, it\u2019s bringing a light to the game and a more fun atmosphere.\u201d\nAnd, in the specific case of flying golf carts, bringing the possibility of air traffic delays or something worse, California among the many states where a person can be charged with DUI while operating an old-fashioned, grounded golf cart.\nWatson admitted the jetpack version \u2013 he nicknamed it \u201cBubba Air\u201d \u2013 remains in the \u201cexperimental stage\u201d and noted that operating the contraption will require extensive instruction.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through training, just like a pilot,\u201d Watson explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a process, like flying an airplane.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t terribly reassuring, seeing how I, like most golfers I know, can\u2019t even safely land a pitching wedge from 100 yards out.\nBut, hey, I don\u2019t see anyone trying to bring jetpacks to football or baseball, golf truly on the leading edge in terms of attracting younger people, all of whom will certainly take notice if they ever stop playing Pokemon GO.\nThis sport, as a matter of fact, never has been more cool, what with young stars like Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy proving you can succeed without being as square as a golf ball is not.\nAnd now, the game is about to make its return to the Olympics, a gathering with the decidedly hip sports of beach volleyball and BMX to offset the awkward, arthritis-inducing, orthopedically-tragic endeavor that is race walking.\nBut there is, of course, a problem, Day, Spieth and McIlroy among the many athletes who famously have pulled out of the Olympics because of concerns about health, safety or just general well-being.\nI can\u2019t fault anyone for deciding not to venture to Rio de Janeiro next month given the unstable conditions there, the situation summed up by disgruntled, underpaid policemen and firefighters greeting people at the airport with messages promising calamity.\n\u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d read some of their signs, according to reports, many of which included mention of the body parts that recently washed ashore near the venue that will be used for beach volleyball.\nThese stories are, indeed, disturbing and much more significant than the incident last week when someone rushed the Olympic torch relay and tried to douse the flame with a fire extinguisher.\nWatson, however, will be in Brazil, representing the U.S. and doing so as the highest-ranked golfer in attendance. Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler and Danny Willett will be there, too, assuring that the winner will have to earn his gold medal.\nThe 2016 Games will end, at 112 years, the Olympic reign of George Lyon, the most recent golfing gold medalist.\nLyon won in St. Louis in 1904 at the age of 46, which sounds incredibly old for a golfing champion until remembering what Phil Mickelson nearly did last weekend at the same age.\nUnlike Mickelson, however, Lyon, a decorated multi-sport athlete, didn\u2019t even begin playing the game until he was 38, only then taking up golf because he was getting too old to do anything else.\nAnd, unlike whoever wins in Rio, Lyon doubled as an insurance salesman.\nYeah, the Olympics were a little different back then, the lineup of sports in St. Louis including tug of war and something called roque.\nMaking the Olympic golfing field 2016, required achieving a world ranking of notable distinction. In 1904, it required paying an entry fee of $5.\nThe United States totaled 239 medals in the St. Louis Summer Games and no other nation won more than 13, Russia clearly not yet turned on to the power of performance-enhancing drugs.\nLyon, a Canadian who later was induced into the country\u2019s sports and golf halls of fame, also was presented a silver trophy for winning. At the awards ceremony, he celebrated by walking the length of the dinning hall on his hands, something I\u2019m guessing Mickelson couldn\u2019t do.\nBut today, by comparison, we have Olympic golfers soaring through space. Times certainly have changed, especially for a sport that has been waiting more than a century to spring ahead by chasing down its five-ringed past.\n\u201cIf we stand still, we\u2019re backing up,\u201d Watson said this week. \u201cI\u2019m always going forward, always thinking forward.\u201d\nAlways jetting forward, \u201cBubba Air\u201d taxiing for takeoff, strapped in for a flight he hopes is gloriously non-stop.\n}}

{{Tehran attempts to overhaul its global image \u2013 and win new customers for its oil \u2013 by playing down nuclear ambitions\nTo watch Iranian state television, you'd think the country was hosting the Olympics. Rolling television coverage included reporters at the airport covering the landing of diplomats as if they were top athletes, and ongoing interviews with delegates being asked to comment on the hospitality of Iranians and their impressions of Tehran.\nBy devoting so much airtime to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, Iran's biggest international conference in three decades, authorities had one aim: to seize upon the rare presence of several heads of state and government to claim a diplomatic triumph in defiance of western-led efforts to isolate Tehran over its controversial nuclear dossier.\nBut there were some things Iranian media didn't show. When it came to the remarks made by the Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi, denouncing the Syrian regime, and those of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, obliquely criticising his hosts' policies, Iranian news agencies either censored their remarks or simply altered the translations.\nFor Iran's leaders, hosting the summit represented an opportunity for an image makeover. In the face of the latest embargo against the import of the Iranian oil, it was also an effort to find new customers. They were able to depict an Iran that was a key-player in international politics but the unfortunate victim of a western-led campaign against its peaceful nuclear programme.\nThis is why when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took the stage on Thursday morning for the official ceremony of the summit in north Tehran, addressing leaders of the movement's 120 nations, families of the Iranian nuclear scientists killed in a series of assassinations in recent years were seated in the front row, holding pictures of the victims. Outside the venue, the cars wrecked in the killings were displayed alongside pictures of family members.\n\"Our motto is nuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for none,\" said the Ayatollah, adamant that his country was not seeking to make nuclear bombs, which it considered a \"sin\".\n\"It is most unfortunate to see that countries possessing the largest nuclear arsenals have no serious and genuine intention of removing these deadly weapons from their military doctrines,\" he added, according to quotes carried by his official website.\nAs Khamenei was speaking, the International Atomic Energy Agency was preparing to unveil its latest report on Iran's nuclear programme, which the west suspects might have military dimensions. The report is expected to reveal that Tehran has increased its potential capacity to refine uranium by installing more than 300 centrifuges at an underground uranium enrichment facility, despite UN calls for more clarity over its activities.\nThe Ayatollah, who is known not to have left Iran for more than 20 years, was conscious of his audience. As well as Morsi, the first Egyptian president to go to Tehran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, there was Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, which does not support the western economic sanctions on Tehran. There was also Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai, Qatar's Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and top-level officials from all the Persian Gulf countries.\nIn his speech, Khamenei also attacked the UN security council as an \"unjust\" and \"defunct relic\" used by the US \"to impose its bullying manner on the world\". Criticism of the UN structure is a common themewithin the 51-year-old movement, a group of countries created during the cold war that was careful not to directly align with either power bloc.\nThe Ayatollah tried to avoid controversy by not referring directly to the conflict in Syria, although he denounced the Americans for \"military intervention\" in other countries.\nTo Iranian dismay, however, Morsi failed to follow suit. The Egyptian leader described the Syrian government as \"an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy is an ethical duty\" and voiced support for \"the struggle of those seeking freedom and justice in Syria\". His remarks prompted a walkout by the Syrian delegation.\nAnd the UN leader made things even more uncomfortable for his hosts by using his speech to criticise those who deny the Holocaust or threaten Israel \u2013 an implicit reference to the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\"I strongly reject threats by any member state to destroy another or outrageous attempts to deny historical facts such as the Holocaust,\" Ban said, albeit without mentioning Iran. \"Claiming that Israel does not have the right to exist or describing it in racist terms is not only wrong but undermines the very principle we all have pledged to uphold.\"\nBan is said to have raised concerns about the nuclear programme in his meeting with Khamenei on Wednesday. His full remarks were censored, and the image from the meeting that dominated Iranian media shows a humble secretary general sitting face-to-face with a smiling and authoritative Ayatollah unleashing a tirade of reproach.\nFor the Iranians, the image makeover was complete.\n}}

{{Bright and early tomorrow on Friday, the 2018 Winter Olympics kick off with Opening Ceremonies\u2014but not without some controversy from Team USA.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced that Erin Hamlin would lead her teammates around the track in Pyeongchang. In Sochi, Hamlin became the first American to medal in singles luge with a third-place bronze, and she plans to retire after this year. She wasn't a shoe-in for flag-bearer, however, The Washington Post reports.\nThe decision came down to a coin toss between Hamlin and speedskater Shani Davis, the first black athlete to win a gold medal in an individual Winter Olympic event. He is also a five-time Olympian with two gold medals and two silvers. When votes were cast for the U.S. flag bearer, Hamlin and Davis tied, so U.S. Olympic officials gave it all over to chance, and Hamlin won the flip.\nIn a tweet Thursday morning, Davis made it clear he was not happy with the decision to flip a coin:\nAlthough he implies he'll be back in 2022, it is likely this will be Davis' last Olympic appearance. Hamlin, for her part, said \"the nerves will be flying, for sure\" when she leads with team around the track under the American flag, but she has not commented on Davis' tweet.\nThis isn't the first controversy to affect the U.S. Team. After Mike Pence was selected by the White House to lead the U.S delegation in Pyeongchang, figure skater Adam Rippon, who is gay, criticized Pence for his anti-gay stances and refused to meet with him. (Pence did not take it well.) He and Lindsey Vonn have also stated they will not attend Trump's celebration in the White House after the Olympics.\n}}

{{Rio de Janeiro has cut budgets across the board, delaying officers\u2019 salaries, halting patrols and fueling worries about safety at the world\u2019s premier sporting event\nJust weeks ahead of the Olympic Games, police helicopters are grounded, patrol cars are parked and Rio de Janeiro\u2019s security forces are so pressed for funds that some have to beg for donations of pens, cleaning supplies and even toilet paper, fueling worries about safety at the world\u2019s premier sporting event.\nRio de Janeiro governor declares state of financial emergency ahead of Olympics Read more\nBrazil is suffering the worst recession in decades and Rio\u2019s acting governor declared a state of financial disaster this month, largely to bolster spending on security as the world\u2019s spotlight turns to the city.\n\u201cHow are people going to feel protected in a city without security,\u201d Gov Francisco Dornelles told Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper. \u201cWe can have a great Olympics, but if some steps aren\u2019t taken, it can be a big failure.\u201d\nRio state has slashed budgets across the board, including that of the police. Helicopters have been grounded and more than half of the civil police\u2019s fleet of cars has been idled in a bid to save on gas. Even officers\u2019 salaries have been delayed.\nAngry civil police officers staged a strike on Monday, with one contingent greeting visitors at Rio\u2019s international airport with a sign reading, in English: \u201cWelcome to Hell. Police and firefighters don\u2019t get paid; Whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe.\u201d\nThe cuts have led to \u201ca very big crisis in ... the self-esteem of the policemen,\u201d said Ilona Szabo, executive director of the Instituto Igarape, a Rio-based security and social issues think tank.\nEven so, she said the sheer number of officers on the streets should help avoid a major security breech at Olympic sites and in Rio\u2019s beachfront neighborhoods. Olympic officials insist Rio\u2019s fiscal problems won\u2019t affect security for the games.\nSome 85,000 police and soldiers \u2013 roughly twice the security contingent at the London Olympics \u2013 are to be deployed during the 5-21 August games, which are expected to draw an estimated 350,000 to 500,000 foreigners to a city of 12 million people where armed muggings, stray bullets and turf wars between heavily armed drug gangs are routine.\nRio\u2019s civil police, who oversee investigations while the military police handle patrols, acknowledged in a statement that \u201csome stations\u201d are receiving donated office supplies.\n\u201cIn March, the head of the police station here came to me and said she didn\u2019t even have paper to print out the incident reports,\u201d said Maria Thereza Sombra, an 81-year-old former teacher who heads the neighborhood association in Rio\u2019s tony Morro da Viuva area. \u201cThat\u2019s how far we\u2019ve fallen. I\u2019ve never seen it this bad.\u201d\nThe recession that saw Brazil\u2019s economy shrink by four percentage points last year has taken a particularly tough toll on Rio. During the boom years, the state awarded billions in tax exemptions to companies ranging from industrial giants to small-scale jewelry dealers, nightclubs, restaurants and love hotels. Tax revenues sunk further with the fall of oil prices that fund much of the state\u2019s budget.\nLocal newspapers recently reported that the balance in state coffers had dwindled at one point to around $10,000. The salaries of some state workers are being paid in installments and some retirees are now receiving their pensions months late.\nGov Dornelles last week declared a state of financial disaster that paved the way for 2.9bn Brazilian real ($860m) in emergency aid from the federal government. The funds are earmarked for Olympic security \u2013 fanning hopes that the situation of Rio\u2019s beleaguered police may improve.\nIn the meantime, donations continue to provide a lifeline for some police stations.\nSombra said her neighborhood association turned to local residents for help: \u201cNow\u2019s the time for us all to unite.\u201d\nThe association papered buildings with appeals for donations: paper towels, paper clips, pens and even toilet paper.\n\u201cSome people grumbled. They said, \u2018I already pay taxes, so why should I have to go into my pocket again for this?\u2019 And I say, \u2018If you get carjacked and you need an incident report for your insurance and the cops can\u2019t print it, are you going to be worried about your taxes then?\u2019\u201d Sombra asked.\nCivil police chief Fernando Veloso declined multiple requests for an interview. He was quoted in a recent interview in O Globo as saying: \u201cWe\u2019re at the limit of our operational capacity, and I can\u2019t discard the possibility of a collapse.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to avoid thinking about more cuts, and these cuts will impact our final product, which is serving the population,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve had to revise everything, even our operations during the Olympic Games.\u201d\nBeth Penna Pereira, a psychologist from Rio\u2019s high-end Leblon neighborhood, experienced the cuts first hand when her purse was stolen at a neighborhood bakery. When she went to the local precinct to report the incident she left empty-handed.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have paper for the incident report. None of the printers are working ... We haven\u2019t received any supplies for a while,\u2019\u201d she recalled the officer saying.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling more insecure, more unprotected, more helpless,\u201d she said.\n}}

{{Looking for some inspiration? Perhaps a little perspective? Go no further than Whitney Lackey, a 17-year-old Special Olympics athlete who was diagnosed with the rare disorder tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) at 2 months old.\nWhitney and her family live in Lebanon, Tennessee. Because of TSC, Whitney has non-cancerous tumors in her brain, kidneys and eye, and developmental delays. No matter. She represents Team Tennessee at the 2014 Special Olympics USA in the bocce event, competing June 16 through 18. Her mom, Sharon, has her own goal in mind \u2014 raise awareness about TSC and the need for more education and research.\n\u201cWhen we received the diagnosis in 1997, we were absolutely devastated,\u201d Sharon shares. \u201cWe thought we were going to live a life of pain and misery, but as it turns out we have lived a life of abundant blessings.\n\u201cI want other parents to know that despite TSC your child can live a very happy and successful life and you can never imagine how much joy they will bring you and everyone that knows them.\u201d\nPatients often first in family to get TSC\nEarly diagnosis is key, says Dr. John Bissler, director of the Tuberous Sclerosis Center of Excellence at University of Tennessee Health Science Center, UT Le Bonheur Pediatric Specialists, LCH. He specializes in pediatric nephrology and tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\u201cTuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disease that affects how cells control their growth,\u201d he explains. \u201cAlthough the disease is genetic, most patients get the disease even though their parents do not have the disease. They are the first ones in their family to get it. [TSC] can cause disease by affecting how organs develop, or even if they develop normally they can later develop tumors.\u201d\nPath of positivity\nWhitney\u2019s journey from a diagnosis at 2 months to Special Olympics athlete at 17 hasn\u2019t been easy, Sharon shares, but her daughter\u2019s outlook has never wavered.\n\u201cI am inspired by Whitney every day,\u201d her mom says. \u201cShe gets out of bed with a smile on her face and it stays there until she goes to bed at night. She is the most positive person I have ever met\u2026 and she believes she can do anything. She is a real superhero in my eyes.\u201d\nCommunity needs experts, funding and long-term care\nBecause TSC is uncommon, diagnosis can be difficult. But once diagnosis is made, coordinated and expert care is vital, Dr. Bissler says. \u201cWhat is needed most is a few very large centers [that provide] very experienced specialists in birth-to-old age care,\u201d he explains.\nDr. Bissler points to three immediate needs in the TSC community \u2014 expert care, financial help for families and expert long-term care as children become adults.\n\u201cWhile there may be insurance coverage, travel, co-payments and other costs can add unbelievable stress to the family,\u201d Dr. Bissler explains. \u201cThe needs of a child can limit a parent from working, further exacerbating the financial pressure. The stress of having a sick child and not enough money can make families draw together, but more often families can succumb to such stress, further hurting each family member.\u201d\nPromising research\nA study published in in 2008 in the New England Journal of Medicine offered hope, pointing to a specific drug that could treat the kidney and lung disease, Dr. Bissler says. \u201cObservations from this study led to additional work that demonstrated that the same class of drugs could treat the brain tumors associated with TSC,\u201d he adds.\nOlympics today, diploma and job tomorrow\nThe Lackeys stay focused on Whitney\u2019s short- and long-term goals. The Special Olympics are on the immediate horizon, and the family is chronicling Whitney\u2019s journey on Tumblr.\nBut after the Olympics? Whitney dreams of graduating from high school and getting a job, her mom says.\n\u201cShe has always loved being given a job to do,\u201d Sharon shares. \u201cShe has always been a people pleaser and it makes her happy to do something for someone else. There is no doubt in my mind that she will be able to get a job someday.\u201d\nMore about genetic conditions\nMy son lived for 10 days and changed my life\nEmbracing my son\u2019s Down syndrome\nMom faces genetic duplication in herself, kids\n}}

{{A congressional review of the U.S. Olympic system\u2019s handling of sex-abuse cases criticizes a culture that sought to protect reputation and image over athlete safety.\nA House subcommittee released the report Thursday, outlining conclusions about the handling of sex-abuse cases involving Larry Nassar and others that have led to calls for change at the U.S. Olympic Committee and the sports organizations it oversees.\nThe report acknowledges the changes that have come since Nassar\u2019s crimes were exposed. But it criticizes the lack of conformity among the organizations, noting some didn\u2019t use background checks or publish banned lists.\nThe panel\u2019s recommendations include a review of the law that governs the USOC, and the USOC using its authority to more actively protect athletes.\nUSOC CEO Sarah Hirshland pointed out the federation formed the U.S. Center for SafeSport and is reviewing how it engages with the national governing bodies and athletes. A report commissioned by former WNBA President Lisa Borders is expected next year.\n\u201cWe will continue to do the work necessary to develop a healthy culture that keeps athletes safe and allows them to be their very best,\u201d Hirshland said.\nIn one of the most striking examples of the diffuse policies that exist in the U.S. Olympic system, the report included a table detailing each NGB\u2019s policy on how it handles banned lists. Each response was different; 18 of the NGBs do not publish their lists.\nThose differences are part of what has made it difficult for the SafeSport Center to publish a comprehensive list of all banned people \u2014 among the many tasks it was given when it was established in March 2017.\nThe report said perhaps its most troubling finding was a culture that prioritized image over safety.\nIt included instructions to panels that deliver sanctions that included \u201cthe effect on the USOC\u2019s reputation\u201d as one of the factors to consider when deciding on penalties. That bullet point has since been removed.\nAlso in the report was a deposition from a USOC attorney that underscores the general state of confusion about the relationship between the USOC, the NGBs and the athletes. On a day-to-day basis, NGBs have more direct contact with athletes than the USOC. Meanwhile, the USOC provides funding to NGBs but doesn\u2019t have much say in their operation.\nIn a 2016 deposition related to sex abuse, USOC attorney Gary Johansen was asked: \u201cYou want to protect your athletes from being sexually abused. That\u2019s a top priority, right, sir?\u201d\nJohansen\u2019s response: \u201cThe USOC does not have athletes.\u201d\n}}

He added that \u201cit was immaterial to the outcome\u201d of the U.S. team\u2019s Gold win. \u201cAll of the drama was about the US performance, not what the Russians did or did not achieve, said Lazarus. \u201cIt did nothing to alter the suspense\u201d. In a conference call from London, Lazarus and NBC Research\u2019s Alan Wurtzel sought to address the criticism that the network has received for its tape delay of the XXX Summer Olympics from London, most noticeably the Opening Games on July 27. Noting time zone difference and other limitations, the NBC Sports boss said \u201cour preference is to do things live\u201d. Lazarus added that he hopes the 2016 Olympics Opening Ceremony from Rio will be live. Lazarus also said that it was a \u201cregretful\u201d moment when a promo was shown on the East Coast of Missy Franklin winning a gold medal before the race was actually broadcast in the States and the network has installed a back-up system to ensure such a mistake doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe will continue to innovate our coverage\u201d, Lazarus noted later \u201cThere is no way for us to show all live action in the US in primetime,\u201d he said. \u201cWith so many simultaneous events going on, you cannot physically show everything live\u201d, added the Group Chairman. \u201cThe ratings are strong and our business partners are pleased\u201d, said Lazarus, reiterating that NBC will break even on the Games and predicting they might even make \u201ca little bit of money.\u201d NBC are \u201cover delivering in all areas\u201d on air, online and social media, Lazarus also noted. During its first days, the London Olympics have consistently beaten the 2008 Beijing Games in the ratings. The Olympics from the UK drawing over 35.8 million viewers on the opening weekend, making it the most watched Summer Games opening weekend ever. Wurtzel predicted that the London Games could well end up being in the Top 5 most watched TV events ever.\nRelated: NBC Edited Out Women\u2019s Gymnastics Fall To Create Fake Gold Medal Suspense\nNBC \u2018Today\u2019 Promo On Missy Franklin Spoils Net\u2019s Coverage Of Swimming Win\nNo Fury Like Live Olympics Viewers Scorned\nNBC Hammered Back Home For Not Airing Live From London\n}}

{{Empty\nNEW YORK -- What's Chinese for \"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em\"? There may not be a direct translation, but that's exactly what the 11th Shanghai International Film Festival plans to do by showcasing a handful of imported sports-related films this June 14-22, just weeks before the Beijing Olympics.The largest -- or at least most expensive -- of the films that could help the SIFF share Beijing's sporting spotlight is likely to be \"Asterix at the the Olympic Games,\" the French live-action version of the 1968 comic of the same name. When introducing it at an annual French cinema event in China in April, production giant Pathe's CEO Jerome Seydoux told local media: \"We can almost say the film is specially shot for China.\" The comment wasn't a bad technique to smooth the way for a difficult-to-obtain import license, granted to only 20 films each year.But \"Asterix\" might also be running with another handicap. The Chinese were in protest against all things French in the wake of human rights protestors assaulting a wheelchair-bound Chinese female athlete bearing the Olympic torch in Paris. The protests have faded as China's attention has shifted to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan Province on May 12, but \"Asterix\" still awaits word from the censors, says Christine Pernin, the head of the French cultural promotion organization UniFrance. \"We hope we will get it a wide release before the Olympics begin,\" she adds.Another sports movie aiming to ride the wave of Chinese sports fervor is \"Heart of a Dragon.\" Inspired by a true story, it echoes the life of a wheelchair-bound athlete, Rick Hansen, who competed for Canada in the 1984 Olympic games and also won 19 wheelchair marathons, including three world championships. \"Heart\" was made with the blessing of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, a group long backed by former Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping's disabled son, Deng Pufang.Writer-director Michael French says the film has been cleared by the Film Bureau for import, and he is in discussions with the China Film Group about distribution. In a nation where it's still rare to find wheelchair accessible sidewalks, let alone buildings, and many disabled people are barred from attending normal schools, distribution of \"Heart\" could make a powerful statement. \"This film took us 10 years to make,\" says French, \"but the challenges disabled people face in China and everywhere still need to be addressed.\"\n}}

{{Although the Russian track-and-field team will not be allowed to compete in the Olympics this summer, the Russian athlete who blew the whistle on her country\u2019s widespread doping scheme has been cleared to run in Rio. But she won\u2019t be competing for Russia.\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations, the global governing body for track and field, said Friday that Yuliya Stepanova can compete as an independent neutral athlete at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in August. Stepanova, whom Russian President Vladimir Putin called \u201cJudas\u201d for outing fellow teammates in 2014 for using performance-enhancing drugs, will compete in the 800-meter race.\nWhile the International Olympic Committee has the final say on whether she can compete, it has followed IAAF recommendations in the past. The federation, in a statement, said Stepanova \u201cmade a truly exceptional contribution to the protection and promotion of clean athletes, fair play and the integrity and authenticity of the sport.\u201d The IAAF also said:\nMs. Stepanova\u2019s participation as a neutral athlete in International Competition is still subject to acceptance by the organizer of the competition in question, in accordance with the rules of that competition. The IAAF has immediately informed European Athletics of Ms. Stepanova\u2019s eligibility given that the European Athletics Championships will take place in Amsterdam in less than a week (6-10 July). Other international events organizers will receive similar notification of Ms. Stepanova's eligibility later today.\nThe IAAF has received at least 80 applications from other Russian athletes to compete as neutral competitors in the upcoming Olympics, arguing they were not involved in the doping scheme and have been tested by anti-doping authorities outside their home country for long periods of time. The IAAF will rule on those applications, which must be turned in by Monday, by July 18.\n}}

{{We are told by practically everyone that nationalism is an archaic, aggressive, and downright evil sentiment, one that causes wars, racism, bigotry, and probably the common cold as well. And we get this from both the right and the left. Nationalism of any kind, we are told, is a dangerous atavism, a throwback to primitive \u201ctribalism\u201d and an insult to sacred \u201cmodernity.\u201d While this nonsensical view is pretty widespread throughout the Western world, it is especially dominant \u2013 at least among the political class \u2013 here in the United States, where it is routinely alleged that America isn\u2019t a place, it isn\u2019t the American people: America, they solemnly intone, is an Idea. What sort of idea, or, rather, whose idea, seems to be a matter of some dispute: but, in any case, we aren\u2019t really an actual country, according to the wise and wondrous elites who let us know what to think, so much as we\u2019re an abstraction, floating in the ether, like a cloud in the sky imprinted with the image of a giant welcome mat.\nThings are quite different on the Korean peninsula.\nThey called it the Hermit Kingdom before its forcible opening by the Western powers, and for a very good reason: unlike Japan and, later, China, the Koreans stubbornly resisted trade \u2013 or, indeed, any sort of contact with the West, which was strictly forbidden. While Western writers routinely attribute this to the supposedly tyrannical rule of Yi Ha-ung, the Regent (1864-97), Koreans then and now revere him as the defender of the nation from European encroachment and domination, which was China\u2019s sad fate.\nAn American crew in service to a British company made the first serious attempt to \u201copen\u201d Korea: in 1866 the General Sherman tried to sail up the Taedong river to reach Pyongyang, but were ordered back by the Korean authorities. The Westerners ignored this edict and continued on their way, but were soon beached when the river waters ran low. They were then set upon by the Koreans, who rescued the Korean officials who had been taken hostage by the crew and killed everyone on board. An inauspicious beginning to a relationship rife with conflict: today there is a monument on the spot where the General Sherman was burned which informs visitors that the leader of the attackers was the great-grandfather of Kim Il-Sung!\nSeveral more attempts were made by the Europeans, and all were repulsed: the French sent Catholic missionaries, who were ruthlessly persecuted along with their few converts. It was the Japanese who, finally, succeeded where the Western barbarians had failed: a Japanese force invaded in 1876 and succeeded in imposing a \u201ctreaty\u201d according to which they acquired a complete trade monopoly, locking out the Chinese, their major rivals. This was endorsed by the king, who was considered a weak ruler, but opposed by Queen Min, who resisted the Japanese westernizing influence. As tensions rose, the Japanese demanded that the Koreans pay them tribute: Queen Min mocked the Japanese emissaries for wearing Western clothes and had them summarily deported. Shortly afterward a gang of Japanese thugs murdered her in her palace: she is today considered a symbol of patriotism and is honored in both the North and the South. During the subsequent Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese annexed the Korean peninsula, where they exercised dominion as part of their empire until the end of World War II.\nKorea\u2019s history is one of implacable and fairly constant conflict with the violent and aggressive West, as well as resistance to both Japanese and Chinese domination: it is, in short, the history of a fiercely nationalistic people determined to shape their own destiny in the face of avaricious imperialism.\nThe division of the Korean peninsula as the victorious Allied powers devoured the spoils of war did not erase the spirit of the courageous Queen Min, who sought an independent road for her country, or the Regent who resisted \u201cmodernization,\u201d i.e. the integration of Korea into one or another mercantilist arrangement.\nWhile the communist North and the Western-occupied South certainly developed along far different lines, beneath the thin veneer of official ideology the country retained its nationalistic character. Both fragments of the split apart nation set up ministries devoted to \u201cunification,\u201d and, despite efforts by the Bush II administration to stop it, the \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d of economic cooperation and closer ties nearly succeeded in bringing the two regimes to the point where unity was at least a possibility. However, the Bushites were determined to torpedo that effort and they finally succeeded, naming the North as part of the \u201caxis of evil,\u201d and threatening to invade by regularly conducting military \u201cexercises\u201d that limn a full-scale frontal attack. This is a yearly ritual.\nDespite all this, Queen Min is still looking out for her subjects: her unabashedly nationalist spirit pervades the new sense of optimism that is preceding the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea, with the full participation of the North. In a move that surprised \u2013 and horrified \u2013 the warmongers in the West (both inside and outside the Trump administration) North and South Korean athletes will march together under a special \u201cunification flag\u201d: the two countries will unite their hockey teams, and the North\u2019s two champion figure skaters, Ryom Tai-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik, described by their South Korean counterparts as \"friendly and kind and a little bit shy,\" will be the stars of the show. The North Korean state orchestra is scheduled to perform.\nWhat is saving the Korean peninsula from a war so horrific that it is unthinkable is nothing less than nationalism, i.e. love of country and a fierce desire to preserve it against the depredations of foreign powers. As I wrote last year:\n\u201cNo, China is not the key to ending the impending North Korean crisis: with the installation of an antimissile system in South Korea, which the Chinese think is aimed at them, they aren\u2019t likely to cooperate in any meaningful way. And, in any case, their influence is very limited, since their relations with Pyongyang have never been worse.\n\u201cThe initiative is going to have to come from Seoul, which has the most to lose if war breaks out. And when this initiative does come, Washington must welcome it, and do everything to foster it. When Trump was campaigning for President, he questioned the US presence in the South and wondered aloud why we had to risk war and bankruptcy providing for Seoul\u2019s defense. His instincts were right: now perhaps we\u2019ll get to see if his policies match his campaign rhetoric.\u201d\nThe initiative did come from Seoul. Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric since taking the White House has caused many of the more hysterical NeverTrumpers to squeal that he\u2019s about to launch a first strike at Pyongyang. Folks, it ain\u2019t happening. His rhetoric no doubt helped motivate South Korean President Moon Jae-in to take the initiative in fulfilling his campaign promise to revive the \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d and pursue better relations with the North in a serious way.\nHistory isn\u2019t all about us. Sometimes \u2013 and, in the future, I believe this will increasingly be the case in a multi-polar world \u2013 it\u2019s about people independently determining their own destiny and pursuing the path of peace.\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here.

{{The Russian team secured an overwhelming victory in the overall medals standings at the 2019 Winter Universiade, which ended on Tuesday in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.\nBut what's the secret behind Russia's sweeping success at the biennale international multi-sport event, organized for university athletes? Quite simply, Russian professional athletes were competing against amateur students from around the world.\nRussia's state-driven policy to bend internationally accepted sports rules stems from the close relationship sports and politics have in the country. As the controversial Sochi Olympics demonstrated, participation alone is never enough. Especially at competitions held at home, Russia longs for a guaranteed victory, preferably a resounding one.\nIn Krasnoyarsk, Russia won more than 110 medals, over 40 of them gold. South Korea came in a distant second place with six golds.

{{Olympic Uniforms Upset Veterans 6 Gallery: Olympic Uniforms Upset Veterans\n\u2014 Inside an American Legion post that has \"Hanoi Jane\" targets in urinals and war veterans who paid for their membership with blood, the ex-servicemen gathered around tables and looked at pictures of the new U.S. Olympic team uniforms. They looked right, left, down, up. They squinted to find a sign, any sign, of the American flag. \"There\u2019s the Ralph Lauren logo! What, are you kiddin\u2019 me?\" said Army veteran George Borgstede, 68, a member of American Legion Joyce Kilmer Post No. 25 in Milltown, Middlesex County. On the left pocket of the uniform was the unmistakable polo player and horse insignia of Lauren, designer of the $795 blazers and $55 berets to be worn by U.S. Olympians during opening ceremonies in London in two weeks. If they strained their eyes enough, the veterans gathered at Post 25 saw a minuscule American flag on the other breast pocket. \"When you say the Pledge of Allegiance, they\u2019re covering the Ralph Lauren logo,\" said Borgstede, who served in the Vietnam War. \"The flag\u2019s always supposed to go over your heart. The company logo shouldn\u2019t be larger than the American flag. It is the U.S. Olympic team, not the Ralph Lauren team,\" Inside the veterans hall adorned in red-white-and-blue and silhouettes of fallen comrades, the Olympic motto of \"faster, higher, stronger\" turned into angry, angrier, angriest. Where were the uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team made? China, of course. \"This here\u2019s a slap in the face,\" said post Commander Ron Dixon, 66, an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War. \"We have veterans coming back that are giving their all over there. They\u2019re coming back with no arms, no legs, and they can\u2019t get any kind of job whatsoever. They keep outsourcing. For the amount of money (Lauren) is charging for these, you can\u2019t find a place in the United States to put these together?\" Dixon has an Olympic connection of his own, volunteering as a police officer for the 2002 winter games in Salt Lake City, following the uncertainty in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Korea\" among the wars served by the nine veterans, someone chimed in: \"Civil.\" They made cracks about the Olympic uniforms, saying it looked like the athletes should be working for an airline. \"I think the stewardesses look good,\" Dixon said. At other times, the veterans seethed. \"It just so happens, last week I sent in a donation to the Olympic Committee,\" said Dallenbach, 72. \"I\u2019m going to check.

{{RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Olympic sailor Erik Heil floated a novel idea to protect himself from the sewage-infested waters he and other athletes will compete in during next year\u2019s games: He\u2019d wear plastic overalls and peel them off when he was safely past the contaminated waters nearest shore.\nHeil, 26, was treated at a Berlin hospital for MRSA, a flesh-eating bacteria, shortly after sailing in an Olympic test event in Rio in August. But his strategy to avoid a repeat infection won\u2019t limit his risk.\nA new round of testing by The Associated Press shows the city\u2019s Olympic waterways are as rife with pathogens far offshore as they are nearer land, where raw sewage flows into them from fetid rivers and storm drains. That means there is no dilution factor in the bay or lagoon where events will take place and no less risk to the health of athletes like sailors competing farther from the shore.\n\u201cThose virus levels are widespread. It\u2019s not just along the shoreline but it\u2019s elsewhere in the water, therefore it\u2019s going to increase the exposure of the people who come into contact with those waters,\u201d said Kristina Mena, an expert in waterborne viruses and an associate professor of public health at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an extreme environment, where the pollution is so high that exposure is imminent and the chance of infection very likely.\u201d\nIn July, the AP reported that its first round of tests showed disease-causing viruses directly linked to human sewage at levels up to 1.7 million times what would be considered highly alarming in the U.S. or Europe. Experts said athletes were competing in the viral equivalent of raw sewage and exposure to dangerous health risks almost certain.\nThe results sent shockwaves through the global athletic community, with sports officials pledging to do their own viral testing to ensure the waters were safe for competition in next year\u2019s games. Those promises took on further urgency in August, after pre-Olympic rowing and sailing events in Rio led to illnesses among athletes nearly double the acceptable limit in the U.S. for swimmers in recreational waters.\nNevertheless, Olympic and World Health Organization officials have flip-flopped on promises to carry out viral testing in the wake of the AP\u2019s July report.\nNow, the AP\u2019s most recent tests since August show not only no improvement in water quality \u2014 but that the water is even more widely contaminated than previously known. The number of viruses found over a kilometer from the shore in Guanabara Bay, where sailors compete at high speeds and get utterly drenched, are equal to those found along shorelines closer to sewage sources.\n\u201cThe levels of viruses are so high in these Brazilian waters that if we saw those levels here in the United States on beaches, officials would likely close those beaches,\u201d Mena said.\nBrazilian, Olympic and WHO officials now say Brazil needs only to carry out testing for bacterial \u201cmarkers\u201d of pollution to determine water quality. That\u2019s the standard used by nations around the globe, mostly because it\u2019s been historically easier and cheaper.\n\u201cThe health and safety of athletes is always a top priority and there is no doubt that water within the field of play meets the relevant standards,\u201d the Rio 2016 Olympic organizing committee said in an emailed statement Tuesday. \u201cRio 2016 follows the expert advice of the World Health Organization, whose guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments recommend classifying water through a regular program of microbial water quality testing.\u201d\nHowever, in recent years technological advances have made it simpler and less expensive to monitor viral levels, too.\nThat\u2019s why many in the scientific communities in the U.S. and Europe are pushing for legislation that would require viral testing of water. They argue that repeated studies dating back decades have shown little to no correlation between the levels of bacteria pathogens in water, which quickly break down in salty and sunny conditions like those in tropical Brazil, and the presence of viruses, which have been shown to last for months, and in some cases years.\nThat disparity has surfaced in AP\u2019s testing in Rio, where the water often falls within safe levels of fecal bacteria, but the same water sample shows levels of viruses akin to raw sewage. Many of the testing points show spikes in bacterial contamination, too \u2014 especially in the Olympic lagoon and in the marina where sailors launch crafts.\nRio\u2019s waterways, like those of many developing nations, are extremely contaminated because most of the city\u2019s sewage is not treated, let alone collected. Massive amounts of it flow straight into Guanabara Bay. The Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon and the famous Copacabana Beach also are heavily contaminated.\nRio won the right to host the Olympics based on a lengthy bid document that promised to clean up the city\u2019s scenic waterways by improving sewage sanitation, a pledge that was intended to be one of the event\u2019s biggest legacies.\nBrazilian officials now acknowledge that won\u2019t happen.\nThe AP\u2019s first published results were based on samples taken along the shores of the lagoon where rowing and canoeing events will be held. Other samples were drawn from the marina where sailors enter the water and in the Copacabana Beach surf, where marathon and triathlon swimming will take place. Ipanema Beach, popular with tourists and where many of the expected 350,000 foreign visitors will take a dip during the games, was also tested.\nSince then, the AP expanded its testing to include offshore sampling sites inside Olympic sailing courses in Guanabara Bay and in the middle of the lagoon where rowing and canoeing lanes were located during recent test events.\nThe tests found the lagoon and bay to be consistently virus-laden throughout, but it also captured a spike in the bacterial fecal coliforms in the lagoon \u2014 to over 16 times the amount permitted under Brazilian law.\nMena, the waterborne virus expert, said it makes sense for athletes to think that deeper into the bay and lagoon would be safer, but the testing doesn\u2019t bear that out.\n\u201cOne would expect to see more fluctuations with the levels of any pathogen in the water, but it\u2019s not there,\u201d she said.\nAs a result, none of the venues are fit for swimmers or boaters, she said. Athletes who ingest three teaspoons of water have a 99 percent chance of being infected by viruses.\nThat assessment was echoed by Brazilian virologist Fernando Spilki, coordinator of the environmental quality program at Feevale University in southern Brazil, who is conducting monthly tests for the AP.\n\u201cSamples from the sailing courses and inside the lagoon prove that the viruses are present even away from the shore, away from the sources of pollution, and that they maintain extremely high viral loads,\u201d he said.\nAthletes in Rio test events have tried many tricks and treatments to avoid falling ill, including bleaching rowing oars, hosing off their bodies the second they finish competing, and preemptively taking antibiotics \u2014 which have no effect on viruses.\nDespite those efforts, athletes at a competition in August still fell ill. The World Rowing Federation reported that 6.7 percent of 567 rowers got sick at a junior championships event in Rio.\nThe International Sailing Federation said just over 7 percent of sailors competing at a mid-August Olympic warm-up event in Guanabara Bay fell ill \u2014 but the federation has not conducted a full count of how many athletes got sick in the two weeks following the competition, the rough incubation period for many of the pathogens in the water.\nMena and other experts say it\u2019s difficult to put those figures into international context as each geographic location has unique threats. But in the U.S., for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s maximum illness rate for swimming is 3.6 percent \u2014 and many experts say that is too high.\nThe German sailor, Heil, was one of those who got sick at the Rio test event.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had infections on my legs. Never!\u201d he wrote on the German sailing team\u2019s blog in late August as he underwent painful treatment to scrape the infections off his hips and legs. \u201cThe origin must be the Marina da Gloria. In the future, we will try to travel to Rio right before the start of any event, so that any diseases that show up only occur when we are already back home.\u201d\nIn the year preceding the Olympics, AP is examining monthly water samples for three types of human adenovirus as well as enterovirus, rotavirus and bacterial fecal coliforms. The viruses are found in human intestinal and respiratory tracts. They cause digestive illnesses including vomiting, explosive diarrhea and respiratory problems \u2014 all of which would knock athletes out of competition. Serious heart and brain disease are also possible, though rare. One type of analysis tests for adenovirus types 2 and 5, markers for the sewage contamination.\nWater quality experts say a virus count hitting 1,000 per liter in the U.S. or Europe would cause extreme alarm, leading in many cases to beach closures.\nViral levels were all 30,000 times higher than what is highly alarming in the U.S. or Europe at each of the AP\u2019s new offshore sampling sites: at a point 600 meters (yards) offshore and within the Sugarloaf sailing race course; at 1,300 meters (yards) offshore within the Naval School sailing circuit; and at a spot inside the Olympic lagoon where rowing lanes are located, about 200 meters (yards) from shore.\nIn September tests at the Naval School race course and offshore lagoon points, the water was positive for enterovirus, a major cause of respiratory illness, gastrointestinal ailments and, less often, serious heart and brain inflammation.\nSubsequent cell culture testing showed the viruses in the lagoon water to be \u201cactive and infectious,\u201d but the samples taken from the sailing courses in the bay were not. Mena, the risk assessment expert, said several factors inhibit viruses from growing in a laboratory, but the sheer number of pathogens in Rio\u2019s waters means the risk to human health is unacceptable.\nRio de Janeiro state authorities promised to complete sewerage infrastructure near the Marina da Gloria by the end of this year and are making progress. Authorities say Olympic venues will then be safe.\nBut the high levels of sewage-linked pathogens found in the offshore sailing courses \u201cshow that these viruses don\u2019t just come from the marina \u2014 there are many, many points where sewage enters the bay,\u201d Spilki, the Brazilian expert, said. \u201cThese pathogens we\u2019re looking for, especially the viruses, are able to migrate in the currents in a big way.\u201d\nThose pollution points are mostly the dozens of rivers that crisscross metropolitan Rio and dump hundreds of millions of liters of raw sewage into the bay each day. By the government\u2019s own estimate, just half of the city\u2019s wastewater flowing into the bay is treated.\nSince the AP report in July exposed the serious risk to athletes, Olympic and World Health Organization officials have flip-flopped over whether they would carry out their own viral testing.\nThe WHO, which acts in an advisory role to the IOC, took four different positions on whether or not viral testing should be carried out between July and mid-October. In an Oct. 24 email, the WHO told the AP that it didn\u2019t feel Olympic officials needed to conduct \u201croutine\u201d viral testing, but added that it was not \u201cunconcerned with viral pathogens in water\u201d and that water quality and monitoring would be discussed in Brazil once again in late November.\nMel Stewart, an American who won two swimming gold medals and a bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said if his daughter were a contender in an open-water swimming competition in Rio, he would tell her not to compete.\n\u201cA gold medal is not worth jeopardizing your health,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cRight now there are too many questions. I don\u2019t see safety. It doesn\u2019t appear at this point that the athletes are being thought of first.\u201d\nTimeline of Rio Olympic water testing broken promises\nConfusion, mixed signals from authorities since The Associated Press first reported on contamination of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Olympic waterways:\nJuly 30\nThe Associated Press publishes its first story based on data from five months of viral and bacterial testing of Rio\u2019s venues for Olympic water sports. The levels of disease-causing viruses were similar to those found in raw sewage. The medical director of the International Olympic Committee says in response that there are no plans to change venues and that the World Health Organization, which acts in an advisory role for the IOC, has reassured Olympic officials there is \u201cno significant risk of athlete health.\u201d\nJuly 31\nThe Rio de Janeiro state government and the state environmental agency blast the AP report as alarmist and say it is unfair to judge Rio\u2019s waters based on viral counts, limits of which are not designated in Brazilian legislation \u2014 or most nations. They also question the qualifications of the laboratory where the AP samples were analyzed. David Zee, an oceanography professor at Rio\u2019s state university who has studied pollution in Guanabara Bay for decades and had no part in the AP study, says: \u201cIt\u2019s natural that the authorities react saying that \u2018everything is fine,\u2019 but everything is not fine.\u201d He says the AP testing \u201cwas done in a trustworthy lab.\u201d\nAug. 1\nWHO tells the AP in an emailed statement that it has now \u201cadvised the IOC to widen the scientific base of indicators to include viruses. The risk assessment should be revised accordingly, pending the results of further analysis.\u201d The International Sailing Federation becomes the first to break with the IOC, saying it will carry out its own viral testing of Rio\u2019s waters.\nAug. 2\nIOC reverses course. \u201cThe WHO is saying they are recommending viral testing,\u201d IOC\u2019s medical director, Dr. Richard Budgett, tells the AP. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we will follow the expert advice, so we will now be asking the appropriate authorities in Rio to follow the expert advice, which is for viral testing.\u201d\nAug. 4\nMatt Smith, head of World Rowing, says that \u201ctogether with the WHO and the IOC, we\u2019re going to follow what they say. We will ask that viral testing is done. If there is a problem, we will react. It\u2019s our moral duty.\u201d\nAug. 10\nWHO changes direction, telling the AP in an email that it \u201cwill not issue an \u2018official recommendation\u2019 on viral testing.\u201d It says that \u201cviral testing would not help significantly in the measurement and assessment of water quality.\u201d This statement contradicts WHO\u2019s own published studies showing little to no correlation between the levels of bacterial and viral markers in water \u2014 meaning that just testing for bacteria alone tells experts little about the amount of disease-causing viruses in recreational waters. Also on this day, the AP learns 13 American rowers became sick with stomach illness at the World Junior Rowing Championship held the previous four days.\nAug. 12\nIOC rules out viral testing of Rio\u2019s waters. Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi says IOC will be sticking to WHO guidelines recommending only bacterial testing. \u201cWHO is very clear that bacterial testing is what should be followed,\u201d Dubi says at a news conference in Rio.\nAug. 14\nWHO again reverses course. In a telephone interview with the AP, Bruce Gordon, WHO\u2019s top water safety expert, says that while bacterial testing is the global standard, \u201cWHO would support additional viral testing to further inform the risk assessment by authorities and to verify and address concerns raised by independent testing. In this case, measuring coliphages and enteric viruses would be advisable.\u201d\nAug. 15\nInternational Sailing Federation changes its stance. Dr. Nebojsa Nikolic, the federation\u2019s top medical official, tells the AP that \u201cwe will certainly not\u201d do viral testing.\nSept. 1\nCarlos Nuzman, head of Rio\u2019s local Olympic organizing committee, tells the AP in an interview that \u201cwe will do\u201d viral tests and says work is already underway to understand how best to carry out the viral analysis.\nSept. 16\nThe international swimming federation calls for Olympic officials to carry out viral testing in Rio, according to an internal document obtained by the AP. The federation \u201cand its Sports Medicine Committee strongly recommend that viral tests should also be performed,\u201d it says in a letter to Olympic organizers.\nOct. 16\nWHO again changes course, issuing a statement saying it recommends only bacterial testing for Rio\u2019s Olympics. It says there is \u201ca lack of standardized methods and difficulty interpreting results\u201d for routine testing of viruses. Mario Andrada, spokesman for Rio\u2019s Olympic organizing committee, says they consider that to be \u201cthe final instructions for Rio 2016\u201d and that viral testing will not be done.\nOct. 24\nWHO, in an emailed statement, says its comment \u201cnot recommending \u2018routine\u2019 viral testing is not analogous to WHO recommending that Brazil do nothing and that WHO is unconcerned with viral pathogens in water. \u2026 In fact, we have experts engaged on examining the best monitoring protocols and we will be discussing virus testing at an upcoming meeting in Brazil.\u201d\n}}

{{With just a handful of days left until the Olympic torch moves on from Rio and the games finish for another four years, the medal table has shaken out largely as expected.\nAs of Wednesday morning, Team USA was on top with 28 gold, 30 silver and 28 bronze, pulling in 86 medals in total.\nGreat Britain, the host country in 2012, was second with 19 gold medals and 50 medals total. China was third with 17 gold medals \u2014 even though it scored more overall medals than Great Britain, with 51.\nIn 16th place, the host nation Brazil, with three gold medals and 11 medals in total.\nImage: Google\nIf you break down the medal count by athletes, however, and take a look at where those athletes went to college, one institution is surprisingly high up on the list. Just below Brazil with ten medals, in fact.\nThe University of Georgia has produced an astonishing 48 athletes at the Games this year, according to reports. Its ten medals would put them 14th in the ranking if alumni of the university were considered their own nation.\nAmong the winning ex-students, Shaunae Miller from the Bahamas, who literally dived over the finish line to bag gold in the women's 400-meter final on the track. And Allison Schmitt, who took home gold for the U.S. in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay and silver in the women's 4x100-meter relay in the pool.\nAllison Schmitt celebrates with Madeline \"Maya\" Dirado, Katie Ledecky and Leah Smith after they won the Women's 4 x 200-meter Freestyle Relay Final Image: GABRIEL BOUYS\/AFP\/Getty Images\nIn fact, the school's other victories were all in the pool. Melanie Margalis took gold in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay while Brittany MacLean bagged bronze for Canada in the same race.\nCanadian Chantal Van Landeghem also took bronze, in the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay.\nThe rest were American triumphs: Gunnar Bentz winning gold in the men's 4x200-meter freestyle relay; Chase Kalisz getting silver in the men's 400-meter individual medley; Amanda Weir gaining silver in the women's 4x100 freestyle relay; and Olivia Smoglia earning gold in the women's 4x100 medley relay.\nSo, if you're dreaming of Olympic success in Tokyo or beyond, there's one admissions office you might want to direct enquiries to.\n}}

{{Olympic athletes may benefit from today's sports drinks and high-tech training, but their gymnastics or wrestling performance probably pales in comparison to what early human ancestors could have pulled off.\nThat's because we Homo sapiens have followed an evolutionary track away from sheer body strength and toward the lean, mean endurance qualities of a long-distance runner.\n\"The chimp-like ancestor was like a power athlete,\" said Dan Lieberman, a biological anthropologist at Harvard University. \"Much stronger and faster than humans, but they had no endurance.\"\nNeanderthals, who co-existed with Homo sapiens until roughly 20,000 years ago, may have also posed a challenge to modern humans in terms of power. However, many experts agree that early Homo sapiens were not much different from the burly Neanderthals \u2014 the biggest evolutionary change had already taken place roughly 2 million years ago when human ancestors became serious runners.\nSo in a hypothetical competition, if you wanted to bet on modern Olympic athletes besting earlier humans, choose the endurance events such as the triathalon or soccer. Otherwise the power sports would belong to human ancestors, and for good reason.\nThe power athletes\nFor instance, before 2 million years ago, the earliest human ancestors such as Australopithecus afarensis (represented in part by the famed \"Lucy\" fossil) had just come down from the trees in an evolutionary sense. Their bodies still reflected chimp features such as longer arms and a stronger upper body built for fighting and swinging through the trees.\n\"A big male chimp weighs about 50 kilos [110 pounds], yet could easily rip the arm off someone,\" Lieberman noted. \"You would never want to arm wrestle a chimpanzee.\"\nThe build of Australopithecus unsurprisingly continued the ape trend toward male-male physical competition, said David Carrier, a biologist at the University of Utah. The smaller human ancestor would have had an advantage in fighting sports such as wrestling, especially if the size advantage of modern humans was removed.\nThe same physical advantages would have extended to other Olympic sports as well.\n\"The Australopiths would really excel at gymnastics and diving because of the greater upper body strength, longer arms,\" Carrier told LiveScience. \"Their short stature and low body mass would also have greatly increased their ability to do flips and spins because of the low rotational inertia of their body.\"\nYet when it came to running, Australopithecus found itself in an awkward position of having just learned to walk comfortably on two legs.\n\"Australopithecus represented a biped on the ground with much more climbing ability and without striding locomotion,\" said Ian Tattersall, anthropologist and curator for the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. \"Running would have been possible, but probably not as efficient.\"\nA Neanderthal reconstruction, left, next to a human skeleton. The most dangerous game\nThe ability to run for long distances changed human athleticism \u2014 as well as history \u2014 and came around the 2-million year mark, allowing human ancestors such as Homo erectus to hunt seriously for the first time.\nEarly hunters only had sharpened wooden sticks and clubs, which meant that success in catching and killing prey relied on the difference between human marathon running and animal sprinting.\n\"Most human sports that we value the most (with exception of power sports) involve this incredible ability to run or do aerobic capacity,\" Lieberman said. \"That's really rare. Very few animals adapted for endurance.\"\nLions can run about twice as fast as the fastest Olympic sprinters over short distances to catch their prey. Early humans relied instead upon tiring their prey by running them down to exhaustion, combining a springy step with sweat glands all over the body that prevented overheating.\nModern Olympic marathoners could take full advantage of their running to beat early human ancestors such as Australopithecus in a long-distance race. Even contemporary people who still rely on persistence hunting without long-range weapons can run with equal ease, such as the Tarahumara of northern Mexico.\n\"Kids on lunch break will go run ten miles,\" Lieberman noted. \"The Tarahumara used to run deer down to exhaustion.\"\nA caveman can do it\nThe long-running Homo sapiens may seem very different from its relative the Neanderthal, which overlapped with prehistoric humans on Earth until it vanished about 20,000 years ago. But experts say that the similarity is greater than previously thought, and that our modern perceptions have become skewed by modern living.\n\"If you compare [Neanderthals]to yourself or most people probably living in mechanized urban areas, the Neanderthals would appear very strong,\" said Erik Trinkaus, a physical anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis. \"However, if you compared them to early modern humans, the Neanderthals and early humans would not appear very different.\"\nTrinkaus said that prehistoric humans would have developed similar or greater strength due to their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, a view that he has gradually come to embrace during his professional career.\n\"Going to the gym, going on a bike ride, even most Olympic training doesn't do the same thing as having the same serious level of lifting, walking that people have done in the past,\" Trinkaus explained.\nSome debate still exists as to whether the main physiological differences made a difference, such as wider-spaced hips making Neanderthals less efficient at long-distance running. But for the most part, other experts agree that even some humans today likely resemble Neanderthals in physical terms.\n\"Neanderthals were somewhat shorter and stockier than the average sapiens, but there are modern humans with the same proportions,\" Carrier said. Lieberman described Neanderthals as \"basically like robust early humans.\"\nBoth Homo sapiens and Neanderthals certainly shared a definitive advantage over the earlier Australopithecus \u2014 males and females became much more equal in body strength and size. Modern Olympic athletes have increasingly embraced that trend.\n}}

Security will be 24-7.\"\nA handpicked team of 28 officers, working in a minimum group of two, will protect the torch and its 8,000 torchbearers during the 2012 torch relay.\nThey will run, cycle or walk alongside the Olympic flame as the torchbearers complete their 300m slot on the 8,000-mile relay.\nDesigns for the uniform they will wear are still on the drawing board but it will be athletic gear including a unique security team number and identify them as Metropolitan Police.\nThe unarmed security team, of 28 runners and another eight reserves, were whittled down from 664 applications.

{{PARIS (Reuters) - The president of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, is under formal investigation in France for suspected corruption related to Japan\u2019s successful bid for the 2020 Olympic Games, a French judicial source said on Friday.\nFrench financial prosecutors investigating a multi-million dollar payment made by Japan\u2019s bidding committee to a Singaporean consultancy questioned Takeda in Paris and he was placed under formal investigation on Dec. 10, the source told Reuters.\nIn Tokyo, Takeda said no improper actions such as bribery had taken place in connection with Tokyo\u2019s bid, and that he had not been charged by French authorities.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) said its ethics committee has opened a file on the case and would meet on Friday, adding that Takeda \u201ccontinues to enjoy the full presumption of innocence.\u201d\nUnder French law, a formal investigation means there is \u201cserious or consistent evidence\u201d implicating a suspect in a crime. It is one step closer to a trial, but such investigations can be dropped without going to court.\nFrench investigators have led a years-long probe into corruption in athletics and in early 2016 extended their inquiry into the bidding and voting processes for the hosting of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.\nProsecuting judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke now suspects Takeda - a former Olympic showjumper, longstanding Olympics official and second cousin of Emperor Akihito - of paying bribes to secure his nation\u2019s winning bid, the judicial source said.\nTakeda, who also heads the IOC\u2019s marketing commission, apologised for \u201cthe huge worries that have been brought to the people of Japan, who have given so much support to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics...\u201d\n\u201cIn order to put every doubt to rest I intend to continue cooperating with investigations,\u201d he said.\nFILE PHOTO: Tsunekazu Takeda, President of the Japanese Olympic committee, attends a news conference during the 127th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Monaco, December 8, 2014.

Takeda and the others had denied any wrongdoing, Kyodo said.\nJapanese officials said at the time the two payments were legitimate consultancy fees.

{{Canadian Olympian Tessa Virtue opens up about guilty pleasures and returning to the rink\nIf there's one word Tessa Virtue is familiar with, it's dedication, and she likes it served on ice. The Canadian Olympian has many awards to her name \u2013 she's a two-time Olympic medallist and three-time world champion \u2013 and after a two-year hiatus from the rink with her ice dance partner Scott Moir, she's back for the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics. And back with a vengeance!\nWith her family on the sidelines in South Korea and Scott by her side during the opening ceremony, the 28-year-old star opens up to Hello! about her day-to-day training, her strong ice-dancing partnership (the longest in Canadian history!) \u2013 and her off-rink guilty pleasures.\nBallet was your first passion as a child. What made you trade ballet shoes for ice skates?\nWhile ballet still remains close to my heart, ice dancing has the added benefit of appealing to the fierce competitor in me. It was obvious when I was quite young that combining my passion for movement and physical expression with a measurable, tangible goal (climbing world rankings, aiming for a podium, etc.) was the best of both worlds. The main reason for choosing skating over ballet at age nine, though? I was already committed to a partner!\nWhat\u2019s a typical training day like for you?\nFour hours of ice time, up to two hours in the gym, one hour of treatment - osteopathy, physiotherapy, massage, fascial stretch therapy - and up to one hour of mental prep work. It\u2019s quite a full, regimented schedule!\nDo you have any pre-skate rituals?\nSince returning to competition, I tried my best to lose all of my pre-skate superstitions \u2013 and, let me tell you, there were lots of them! Athletes are creatures of habit, and in stressful situations it\u2019s nice to feel you\u2019re in control of something. Now, Scott and I talk through our program bit by bit, sharing verbal cues and focuses, and we hug! The hug allows us to synchronize our breathing, and ensures connectivity and unison.\nTell us what a skater\u2019s diet consists of. No drinking we assume?!\nHopefully there will be some celebratory beverages consumed post-Games [smiles]. I work with a nutritionist and a naturopath, but mostly my focus is on protein, lots of vegetables, and proper nutrients at key times. I try not to deprive myself too much \u2013 it\u2019s all about moderation! If I had one tip to give, it would be to start your day with hot water and lemon (coffee afterwards is a lovely reward).\nWhat do you love to do and indulge in when you\u2019re not training?\nI have a major sweet tooth, and love pastries, pies, chocolate and candy, so indulging when I\u2019m not training is usually dessert-related. Otherwise, recently I\u2019ve been delving in to the design world, with collaborations with companies like Hillberg and Berk for jewelry, and BonLook for eyewear. It\u2019s been so fun to challenge myself in new ways, and express my vision and aesthetic in the accessory world.\nWhat\u2019s your guilty pleasure?\nLemon meringue pie.\nWho\u2019s your celebrity crush?\nDavid Beckham.\nDescribe your style, and whose personal style you most admire.\nI\u2019d describe my personal style as classic and refined, with a bit of an edge. My love of fashion was instilled at a young age, thanks to my incredibly chic mom, Kate! Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly continue to be my style icons for their effortless poise and elegance.\nHow it that you and Scott have such great chemistry on the ice?\nThe chemistry and connection Scott and I share on the ice stems from a shared love of movement, musicality and storytelling. Off the ice, we are so incredibly different! That said, we have immense respect for one another, and always end up in laughing fits.\nWill your family all be coming out to support you in South Korea?\nWhile they were undoubtedly shocked by the news [of our comeback], my family has been nothing but supportive. My mom, Kate, and sister, Jordan, will be in South Korea to cheer us on live!\nDo you have a favourite memory from the last two Olympics? You\u2019re a veteran now!\nThe best part of experiencing the Olympics is always the friendships made. Team Canada has such an incredible group of fearless, courageous, fun, inspiring athletes \u2013 and we\u2019ll be forever bonded thanks to the unique experiences we have the chance to share together.\nWhat\u2019s it like being out there on the ice during competition?\nThere\u2019s a certain vulnerability to being centre ice, pouring your heart out for others to judge and criticize. But, sometimes, it feels like you\u2019re floating \u2013 time stands still, your blades glide effortlessly, and you get lost in a moment. I suppose the latter is what we\u2019re constantly chasing.\nRumour has it that you and Scott talk during performances ...\nI\u2019m so thankful I have Scott on the ice with me at all times! We do indeed talk throughout our performances, mostly to ensure we both stay present and in tune with one another. We share reminders and cues like \u201cbreathe,\u201d \u201cknees,\u201d \u201ctogether,\u201d and a few words that wouldn\u2019t make any sense to anyone else but help us refocus mid-skate.\nWhat\u2019s next when you finally hang up your skates?\nI\u2019m a few half-credits shy of my psychology degree, so that\u2019s definitely on the docket. Especially as I\u2019d really like to do an MBA! Beyond that, Scott and I will spend a little time touring and performing in various shows around the world \u2013 fun when the focus is entertaining fans instead of winning over judges. [Smiles]\nWhat advice do you have for today\u2019s little seven-year-old figure skaters or other kids looking to follow their dreams?\nThere are no shortcuts or secret recipes to success. It stems from passion and a whole lot of work! But, for kids in particular, it\u2019s important to emphasize balance \u2013 and be exposed to a variety of sports and activities. Mostly, I want everyone to feel limitless.\nFinally, how does it feel to be leading Team Canada into competition this time around?\nCarrying the flag into the opening ceremony at the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang is the highest honour of our career. To march with the Canadian team and represent a nation whose values stand for unity, fairness, equality, and diversity is to feel a sense of pride I simply cannot express in words. The team is ready, and we can\u2019t wait to wear the maple leaf on our backs and in our hearts!\n}}

{{By the time 2024 rolls around, we may be seeing brand new sports at the Summer Olympic Games.\nSome of the new sports include surfing, karate, skateboarding and breakdancing.\nA school in Washington, D.C. called The Lab is already training dancers in breakdancing to prepare them for Team USA.\nCompetitive break dancer Evan Sletten has been a taking classes at The Lab for six years.\n\u201cA lot of upper body strength goes into it,\u201d Sletten describes of the sport.\nSletten says he would describe it as an athletic dance.\n\u201cCompetitive breaking is very different in the sense that there\u2019s rules,\u201d explains The Lab owner Antonio Castillo. \u201cThere\u2019s a point system. You have a referee. You have different criteria in place to make sure it\u2019s a fair sport.\u201d\nCastillo has considered breakdancing a sport for a long time, and he already uses an Olympic scoring model for his students.\n\u201cWe use a 10-point system and all of criteria is the definition of what the dance is, so you can\u2019t argue against it because those are the elements that make up the dance,\u201d Castillo says.\nSletten says the point system helps with improvement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great because if you need to improve, you\u2019re not just seeing win or lose,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing each category, every little thing that you did right that you did wrong.\u201d\nIn a way, this group of competitive break dancers has been gearing up for the gold for years already. So, if the sport gets to take the Olympic stage in 2024, they\u2019ll be ready.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have the first time in history that you\u2019ll have a b-boy or b-girl be the Michael Phelps of breaking, and to me that\u2019s the greatest thing ever!\u201d says Castillo.\n}}

{{Centuries before the Islamic Republic or even Islam, Persian athletes fused spirituality and strength training in a practice called Varzesh-e-Bastani, the legacy of which may still persist.\nFreestyle wrestling is often described as the \"first sport\" of the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to U.S.-based Iranian historian Houchang Chehabi. Iran excels at international wrestling competitions, winning three gold medals at this year's Olympics alone, and an astounding 35 medals since 1948. But the story of how Iran came to so dominate wrestling is older than the Islamic Republic, possibly older than even Islam itself, and may have to do with an Iranian understanding of the sport far different than the West's.\nThough Western cultures typically treat wrestling as an aggressive, individualistic, and deeply competitive sport, traditional Persian Varzesh-e-Bastani emphasizes it as a means of promoting inner strength through outer strength in a process meant to cultivate what we might call chivalry. The ideal practitioner is meant to embody such moral traits as kindness and humility and to defend the community against sinfulness and external threats. The connection of weightlifting with character development might sound odd, but it's perhaps not so different from, for example, the yogic practice of Shavanasa , a meditative pose meant to bolster the spiritual and mental role of yoga's stretches and poses.\nVarzesh-e-Bastani is traditionally practiced in a building called a Zoorkhaneh , which means \"home of strength\" and is often built and decorated in an ancient style that's led archaeologists to trace them to the Mithraic era of the first through fourth centuries, AD. The Mithraic religion, named for the Persian god Mithra, spread through much of the Roman Empire before being displaced by Christianity -- and, much later, displaced by Islam in Persia itself. But some Mithraic ideas and practices persisted in the Zoorkhaneh, and can maybe still be heard in the pre-exercise chanting or seen in the ritual movements.\nHistory is political in Iran, and has been for centuries. Its leaders have alternatively embraced or downplayed the country's ancient, pre-Islamic roots. After the Arab Muslim invasion, Persian elites resisted the new religion for centuries, seeing it as the Arabs' religion. In the 1500s, though followers of Islam's two major schools of Shi'ism and Sunnism had long been dispersed across the Middle East, Persia's imperial Safavid rulers played up Iran's Shi'a heritage as a way to unifying Arab Shi'a against the increasingly Sunni Ottoman Empire. The following migrations of Shi'a to Iran and present-day Iraq helped create a geographic division that largely holds to this day. The shahs of the Pahlavi dynasty, which took over in 1925, tried to bring Iran into the developed world in part by emphasizing its ancient Persian roots as an alternative to the Islamic identity that, as he saw it, tied it to the less developed nations of the Middle East and Central Asia. The Islamist revolutionaries of 1979 veered back in the other direction. In 2009, moderate presidential candidate (and, shortly after that, informal \"green movement\" leader) Mir Hossein Mousavi peppered his campaign posters with images of pre-Islamic cultural sites, a subtle nod to the days before the Islamic Republic.\nThrough these turbulent back-and-forths, leaders and popular movements alike have pushed away one aspect of Persian cultural heritage in order to lift up another, re-re-inventing their society so many times over that few institutions have survived intact. Even the Supreme Leader's Islam does not always look so much like the Shi'ism of earlier generations.\nYet, somehow, the Varzesh-e-Bastani traditions and the Zoorkhaneh have survived, embraced during both the shah's secular Westernizing era and under the Islamic Republic as a symbol of Persian national pride and of cultural roots. Both regimes, though they couldn't be more different, promoted the Zoorkhaneh and entrenched its practices into national physical education, even reminding Iranians that the sport's champions had once defended their communities against the Mongol invaders of a thousand years earlier. The Islamic Republic lionized the Varzesh-e-Bastani wrestler Gholamreza Takhti, elevating him to what one historian calls \"the greatest Iranian sports legend of the twentieth century,\" perhaps in part because he could appeal to both Islamists and more secular skeptics, a unifying figure in a country that badly needed one.\nIranian nationalism and national pride -- of a kind that seems possibly even broader than that of the supreme leader's Islamist nationalism -- has become tightly wound with international wrestling and weightlifting competitions, the two sports most closely associated with Varzesh-e-Bastani. In 1989, just after the end of the devastating eight-year war against Iraq, Iranian heavyweight wrestler Ali-Reza Soleimani defeated an American wrestler for the world wrestling championship that year, exciting Iranians who badly needed something to feel good about, and striking a symbolic (for them) blow against the U.S., which had aided the Iraqis in the war. State funding for wrestling immediately increased , and the Islamic Republic played up its ancient Persian roots to try and cash in on the popularity.\nIn the late 1990s, reformists who followed new President Mohammad Khatami into power hinted that wrestling could be a path to detente with the U.S., a sort of Persian take on China's Nixon-era ping pong diplomacy. It never happened, but wrestling and weightlifting have remained so popular in Iran, and so closely linked to national pride, that Iranian research universities still produce studies on, for example, the effects of Ramadan fasting on weightlifting performance or the personality traits of weightlifters and martial artists versus players of team sports. Though the nation's Greco-Roman wrestling team performed the best of any country in this year's Olympics, Iranian social media users are apparently fuming over one wrestler's loss to a French opponent, insisting that Olympic referees had conspired against him (no, there's no evidence).\nIt's difficult, and maybe ultimately impossible, to say for sure why one country might do particularly well (or particularly poorly) in one athletic competition or another. And it's especially difficult to test the theory that Iranians are so good as weightlifting and wrestling (and, to a lesser extent, tae kwon do) because of those sports' roots in the pre-Islamic Varzesh-e-Bastani tradition, one of the few ancient cultural legacies that has been allowed to persist through the past century of near-endless political turmoil. After all, gold medals in these events are won by a tiny handful of individuals. Still, if even just these dozen or so Iranian athletes believed that their amazing skill was rooted in this particularly Persian heritage, then wouldn't that in itself make it at least somewhat true?\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{{As a pro-Olympic lobby group gathers steam in Calgary, a campaign is underway to find out what Calgarians would rather see the estimated $4.6-billion Olympic price tag spent on.\nThe group No Calgary Olympics got its start about a year ago. Since then, the self-described grassroots movement has been quietly campaigning against the city\u2019s potential bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nOn Thursday, a pro-Olympics movement dubbed Yes Calgary 2026, whose organizers include several former campaigners for Mayor Naheed Nenshi, made themselves known, sporting a logo in Olympic colours resembling a check mark.\nDaniel Gauld, founder of the No Calgary Olympics lobby group, said they aren\u2019t against Calgary ever hosting the Games in the future, \u201cWe\u2019re no Calgary Olympics right now.\u201d\n\u201cGiven where the province is at this time, we just don\u2019t feel that spending this money on what is essentially a two-week party is a really great idea,\u201d Gauld said. \u201cThe economics of it \u2014 that\u2019s our main thing.\u201d\nThey are also wary of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s track record when it comes to doping and gender inequality in sport, as well as the city\u2019s bid process the group calls \u201cinappropriate \u2026 with no public consultation.\u201d\nThe city had estimated the cost of hosting the 2026 Olympics to be around $4.6-billion. But back in March Kyle Ripley, team lead on the city\u2019s Olympic file, said he was anticipating that number to be higher.\nThe anti-Games group is starting a campaign called What Else YYC, to ask Calgarians what they would like to see potential Olympic funds to be spent on.\nGauld said the campaign will collect alternative Olympic ideas and explore those suggestions with a team of experts to see where that $4.6 billion (or more) could be better spent.\n\u201cWhat else would you like to see, project wise, infrastructure wise, that may not see any collateral dollars funding it?\u201d Gauld said, adding the money could be spent on projects with \u201clong-lasting effects,\u201d like public housing, education, and economic diversity.\nYes Calgary 2026, meanwhile, is a pro-Olympics lobby group largely made up of former campaign staffers for Mayor Naheed Nenshi, while Gauld says his group has \u201cno budget and \u201cno political insiders.\u201d\nRelated\nNenshi has said he hasn\u2019t picked a side on the Olympic file, but among the group\u2019s members are; Stephen Carter, an outspoken political campaigner who helped Nenshi with his 2010 mayoral run; the mayor\u2019s former campaign communications director Richard Einarson; his campaign manager Zain Velji; Jason Ribeiro, the mayor\u2019s policy adviser in his 2017 campaign for re-election; and Nenshi\u2019s former chief of staff Chima Nkemdirim.\nNkemdirim said he\u2019s only been affiliated with the group as a volunteer since Wednesday and wasn\u2019t involved in the group\u2019s founding.\nGauld didn\u2019t suggest any underhanded affiliations with Yes Calgary 2026 and city hall, but said he is \u201ccurious\u201d about the group\u2019s connections to the mayor.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some political insiders in this group I feel who are very media savvy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the context of (Yes Calgary 2026), I can\u2019t speak to their genesis or how they formed, but I think it\u2019s very interesting that some of them have some affiliation with our mayor.\u201d\nThe city is expected to begin public consultations on the Olympics ahead of a plebiscite which could be held in November.\nThe plebiscite was a condition of the provincial government\u2019s support for the creation of an Olympic bid corporation in April and could cost an estimated $1.96 million.\nThe exact timing of the plebiscite will also depend on how quickly the city can work out a proposed deal to fund the Games.\nAs both groups work to have their voices heard ahead of the plebiscite, Moshe Lander, an expert in the economics of professional sports, is critical of the public vote.\nHe said the plebiscite acts as a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d for council if the Olympics do come to Calgary and turn out to be an economic bust, by \u201chanding the voter the responsibility of making the decision.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what the issues is \u2014 the fact is that the plebiscite itself is a problem and it\u2019s going to make a bad situation worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole reason that we have elected officials is to make tough decisions and represent us. But in the case of the Calgary Olympics \u2026 it\u2019s bad economics.\u201d\nThe campaign is still in the planning stages, but Gauld says Calgarians can get involved by sending their ideas to nocalgaryolympics@gmail.com, or share ideas on the group\u2019s Facebook and Twitter pages using the handle @noyycolympics.\nRRumbolt@postmedia.com\nOn Twitter: @RCRumbolt\n}}

{{FBI agents badly botched their interview of suspect Richard Jewell in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing case, committing a \"major error in judgment\" that could have jeopardized the case, the Justice Department said in a report Monday.\nThe report, which formalizes and expands on what officials have said privately for some time, paints the FBI as having bungled the Jewell interview in an almost Keystone Kops manner.\nSenior FBI officials hope the report will help close the book on the embarrassing episode, but they may have to wait because Jewell himself is to testify Wednesday before a House committee. Furthermore, with the investigation into the bombing still open, the FBI's conduct in the case is certain to face more scrutiny.\nThe report details how agents in Atlanta devised a last-minute, seat-of-the-pants ruse to persuade Jewell that he was being interviewed for a training videotape. Then, when FBI Director Louis Freeh, who the report said was not informed of the ruse, insisted that Jewell be read his Miranda rights, the ploy fell apart.\nAgent Don Johnson, who felt \"blindsided\" by Freeh's edict as he was interviewing Jewell, tried to persuade Jewell that the Miranda warning was merely part of the training tape, the report says.\nJewell immediately became suspicious and phoned his lawyer, who advised him to stop answering questions.\nIf Jewell had proceeded with the interview and supplied self-incriminating information, it would likely have been useless in court.\nBecause the Miranda warning that he had the right to remain silent was given under false pretenses, Jewell's constitutional rights could have been violated, according to the report.\n\"Presenting the Miranda rights in the manner in which they were presented could clearly indicate to any reasonable person that the Miranda rights were being given as part of this video ploy,\" Freeh told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Monday.\nAs it happened, Jewell apparently had no self-incriminating information to give and was later exonerated.\nSo the FBI agents technically did not violate his rights, Freeh said, not because they handled the situation correctly, but only because Jewell did not incriminate himself.\nThe report did conclude that the video ruse itself was perfectly appropriate. Police often use \"strategic deception\"--for example, falsely telling a suspect that his accomplice has confessed--and the courts have upheld this as a legitimate tactic.\nBut the report blames the agents on the scene for not informing their superiors about the ploy.\nAgent Johnson and a supervisor have been suspended for their roles in the Jewell case and two higher-ups have received letters of reprimand.\nThe case, meanwhile, has taken a dramatically different turn. The FBI now believes the Olympic bombing is linked to two other recent bombings in Atlanta committed by a right-wing extremist group.\nThe report, supplemented by Freeh's testimony, provides a new and complete account of the bungled interview.\nWhen Jewell came to the FBI's attention as a potential suspect in the July 1996 bombing, agents decided to interview him on videotape.\nThe cameraman, from the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., happened to mention that he might use parts of the interview for a training video he was making.\nThat planted an idea in the agents' heads. When Jewell seemed alarmed at having the interview taped, the agents placated him by saying it was for a training video.\nIt apparently did not occur to them to read Jewell his rights; ordinarily that is done only when someone is arrested. But when Freeh heard that Jewell was being interviewed, he ordered that he be read his Miranda warning \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nThis was a surprise to Johnson, the agent conducting the interview. Struggling to incorporate the warning into his video ploy, Johnson told Jewell that to make their session seem like a \"real, official\" interview, \"I'm even going to go as far as to advise you of your rights.\"\nJewell phoned his lawyer and ended the session.\nThe episode turned into a disaster for the FBI.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Jewell was a suspect, and the bureau was widely suspected of leaking the information and then of tarring an innocent man.\nMany FBI agents are angry at the disciplinary action taken against Johnson, complaining that Freeh is at least partly to blame for the mess and that the line agent was a scapegoat.\nWhen Johnson returned his office after his suspension, more than 100 agents lined the sidewalk to greet him.\nJohn Sennett, president of the FBI Agents Association, said the report prepared by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates misconduct within the department, confirms the notion that Johnson was unfairly targeted.\n\"The report seems to say that the agents are guilty of no misconduct and no violation of anyone's constitutional rights,\" Sennett said. \"That leads us to ask the question, why was anyone punished?\"\nFreeh has sent a memo to all FBI agents stressing that ruses may be fine, but they can never be the context for giving someone his constitutional rights.\nFreeh also spoke up on behalf of his troops.\n\"The pressures are intense on those agents in those situations, where everybody in the FBI, including the director, is looking over their shoulder,\" Freeh said.\n\"I think it is a very major error, but a very unique one for the FBI.\"\n}}

{{Simone Biles put the finishing touches on one of the greatest Olympics by a gymnast, capturing her fourth gold of the games with an electric performance in the floor exercise on Tuesday.\nThe 19-year-old American completed an extraordinary stretch that included a team gold for the \u201cFinal Five\u201d as well as individual golds in the all-around and vault and bronze on balance beam. Her five medals tie the most for an American female gymnast in a single Olympics and her four golds tie an Olympic record shared by four others.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every single moment of it. I know our team has. It\u2019s been very long in competing so many times. It got tiring. But we just wanted to end on a good note.\u201d\nTeammate Aly Raisman followed with a 15.500 to give her a third medal during Rio and six overall in her Olympic career. The 22-year-old team captain \u2014 who was second in the all-around to Biles last week \u2014 waved to the stands as she walked off the floor, likely for the final time as a competitor.\nThe medals gave the American women nine during the meet, the most ever by the United States at an Olympics.\nIpsen, 23, had six solid dives in the final to score 475.80 points. But the total was way behind Cao Yuan, who gave China its fifth diving gold medal in Rio. Cao led the 12 finalists from the first dive for a score of 547.60 points. Great Britain\u2019s Jack Laugher won the silver with Patrick Hausding of Germany taking third.\nIpsen struggled in the semifinals Tuesday morning when missing one of his six dives to place seventh. He upgraded his final dive of the competition by adding a twist to get his best score of the finals.\n\u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t hit that dive all week,\u201d Ipsen said. \u201cSo I think that was my face of shock\u201d after his clean entry in the water.\nTeammate Michael Hixon finished 10th to give the Americans two in the top 10 for springboard for the first time since 2000.\nThe unbeaten United States won 25-16, 25-23, 25-22 and has dropped only five sets all tournament. The Americans will face Serbia, a straight-set winner over Russia, in Thursday\u2019s semifinals.\nThe United States will play France in the semifinals Thursday.\nSerbia shocked Australia by eliminating the three-time silver medalists 73-71. Ana Dabovic hit a free throw with 10.2 seconds left to give Serbia a two-point lead, but Australia guard Leilani Mitchell\u2019s heave from near the 3-point arc was short and Marianna Tolo\u2019s desperation put-back didn\u2019t hit the rim.\nIn another close game, Spain advanced to the semifinals by eliminating Turkey 64-62.\nThey have dominated in this regatta, too. They finished third, fifth and fourth in Tuesday\u2019s races to take an unassailable 34-point lead over Germany\u2019s Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel. Defending gold medalists Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen of Australia are in third place going into Thursday\u2019s medal race.\nn After 10,000 meters, the men\u2019s open water swimming race came down to a photo finish.\nFerry Weertman of the Netherlands edged Greece\u2019s Spiros Gianniotis to give the Dutch a sweep of the distance races at Copacabana. Sharon van Rouwendaal dominated the women\u2019s race the previous day.\nThe medals were in doubt until the very end \u2014 and even for a bit longer after that. Gianniotis appeared to go under the finish line first, but he had to reach back to grab the timing pad. Weertman got his hand on the pad a split-second ahead of the Greek swimmer \u2014 a finish so close they were both credited with the same time, 1 hour, 52 minutes, 59.8 seconds.\nThe bronze went to France\u2019s Marc-Antoine Olivier, who out-touched China\u2019s Zu Lijun in another result that required a photo to sort out. Britain\u2019s Jack Burnell was right in the mix, as well, but he wound up being disqualified for a tussle with defending Olympic champion Ous Mellouli just a few meters from the line.\nRussia has not been beaten in an Olympic synchronized swimming event for 20 years, a streak almost certain to be extended when Ishchenko and Romashina go for another gold Friday in the team event.\n}}

{{An Olympic medal-winning boxer was among those injured by gunfire on Monday when government forces re-entered the city of Hama, which had slipped from the authorities' control for almost a month, according to activists.\nThe move could signal an escalating crackdown and draw increased international condemnation against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The regime is simultaneously crushing protests while seeking to hold a \"national dialogue\" on Sunday to find a way out of the crisis.\nBoxer Nasser al-Shami, 29, was among 40 people injured after security forces fired in the city, including a 13-year-old Omar Khalaf, according to activists in the local coordinating committees. One man was reported to be have been left disabled after being shot in the neck. At least 20 people including three women activists were detained.\n\"I want to leave because the situation is very bad,\" said a resident via Skype. Another man said he had evacuated his family from the city.\nHama, a Sunni city north of Damascus, with a population of 800,000 , had been celebrating its \"liberation\". The celebrations were due to the withdrawal of security forces and even traffic police, in the aftermath of huge funerals on 4 June, a day after security forces shot dead more than 70 protesters.\nSince then thousands have taken nightly to the central Assi square calling for the fall of the regime and tearing down posters of the president.\nBut in a sign of a crackdown to come as protests continue, the regime apparently decided it could no longer tolerate the open dissent. Gunfire was reported in city suburbs on Sunday and in the early hours of Monday the army and security set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, activists said. Security forces entered, despite residents' efforts to keep them out with burning tires.\nResidents also tried to protect the Hourani hospital, where the wounded were taken after forces raided neighbourhoods, according to activists. Damascus has been condemned by human rights groups for blocking access to medical treatment and arresting people in hospitals.\nAl-Shami is in a stable condition, Rami Abdel-Rahman of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told the Guardian. The boxer is one of the thousands injured since the uprising began in mid-March, in addition to more than 1,400 people who have been killed. One of a handful of high-profile Syrian sports personalities, Al-Shami won a bronze medal in the 2004 Olympic games in Athens in the heavyweight boxing category. Meanwhile, the army continued to assault villages including Haas and Kafer Nabul in the north-western province of Idleb on Monday, with reports of arrests, gunfire and snipers positioned on rooftops. It was unclear if anyone had been killed in the area as funerals for another two people shot dead in the Hajar al-Aswad neighbourhood of Damascus took place.\nDespite government attempts to woo protesters with promises of reforms, Syrians have been braced for the regime to reassert control over Hama. Activists claimed that half a million took to the city's streets for the biggest protests yet last Friday. In an ominous sign, president Bashar al-Assad sacked governor Ahmad Khaled Abdel Aziz on Saturday, apparently for refusing to clamp down on protesters, activists said.\nHama is a sensitive city for Syrians and the regime after an assault on the city in 1982 killed at least 20,000 people. The assault was ordered by Bashar's father, Hafez al-Assad, to quash an armed Islamist uprising. The city was shelled from outside and some are believed to have starved to death during the siege, which went on for weeks without outside knowledge.\nNidaa Hassan is the pseudonym of a journalist in Damascus\n}}

{{In a span of two years, Kali Flanagan went from BC to Florida to South Korea and back. Now, with a gold medal around her neck, she's ready to lead the Eagles to a long-sought title.\nAround the World and Back In a span of two years, Kali Flanagan went from BC to Florida to South Korea and back. Now, with a gold medal around her neck, she's ready to lead the Eagles to a long-sought title.\nW\nhen the sport of ice hockey is brought up in conversation, perhaps the last place anyone thinks of is Florida. Known for its palm trees and warm winters, the Sunshine State should be the place any great athlete goes at the end of their career, not at the start of it. For Boston College women\u2019s hockey defenseman Kali Flanagan, however, it was the most important step in her journey to becoming a gold medal Olympian.\nGrowing up in Burlington, Mass., Flanagan was essentially raised in the hub of hockey culture. The town was the homeland of Olympians even before she was born, when Mark and Scott Fusco competed for the U.S. Olympic Men\u2019s Ice Hockey Team in 1984, and Peter and Kat Carruthers took home the silver medal in figure skating the same year.\nBurlington\u2019s location was perfect, too. Fifteen miles from downtown Boston, and a 10-minute drive to Ristuccia Arena\u2014the Boston Bruins\u2019 practice facility until 2016\u2014it was impossible for Flanagan to avoid hockey at just about any turn.\nBut maybe Flanagan\u2019s biggest influence was her father, Bill, who played hockey himself for four years at Rensselaer Polytechnic. Even now as a former junior hockey coach and cofounder of the Flanagan Hockey School, his daughter may be his most successful student of the game.\n\u201cI guess I just wanted to be like my dad when I was little,\u201d Kali said.\nThe young Burlington athlete began as a figure skater, but soon pivoted to hockey, a move she would never regret. Flanagan became a fantastic skater, and shined in her high school years at the National Sports Academy in Lake Placid, N.Y. Her prowess on the ice was so noticeable that as a junior in high school, she received an invitation to tryout for the U.S. Under-18 Women\u2019s National Team.\nFlanagan was one of many young skaters brought in to compete for a spot on the nation\u2019s most promising young roster. What began as a giant camp quickly narrowed. She made the first cut\u2014an achievement in itself\u2014but, as the roster bubble shrunk further, in this case from a group of 28 to 23, Flanagan found herself as one of the five on the outside.\n\u201cAt the time, it felt like it was a super big deal, and I was really upset,\u201d Flanagan said, \u201cbut I think it only helped me because it just put a chip on my shoulder, and I just had to work and fight that much harder.\u201d\nWhile most kids her age that summer spent their time worrying about upcoming SATs, Flanagan learned something important about herself: In order to be an Olympian, she would have to step it up a notch.\nAfter spending three years at a prep school in upstate New York, Flanagan\u2019s decision to come to BC brought her much closer to home, but it wasn\u2019t long before she was back on the road again.\nFlanagan remained active on the national stage even throughout her time at BC, traveling to various locations across the country to attend clinics and tryouts. As early as her freshman year she went to senior camps, even making the U.S. Under-22 Women\u2019s National Team that summer, a team full of players from the U-18 team Flanagan had been cut from two years earlier.\nAlong the way, Flanagan was naturally supported by longtime friends and family, but an unlikely source of comfort came from the connections she made throughout her journey.\n\u201cBefore I even made the national team there were always BC\u2014either alums or people who are also here\u2014at [Olympic training camps],\u201d Flanagan said, \u201cso you\u2019d always see a familiar face and have automatic friends, which makes you feel so much more comfortable.\u201d\nAt the start of her junior year, Flanagan headed south for national team tryouts.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know anyone and she took me under her wing and was just a great role model for me during that whole process. She\u2019s a great presence in the locker room and on the ice. She kept things real fun and loose.\u201d \u2014 Cayla Barnes '22\nH\nere, at the Florida Hospital Center Ice in Tampa Bay, she and 41 other American hockey phenoms duked it out over the course of four months to secure one of 23 spots on the Olympic roster. Again, though, Flanagan\u2019s experience in traveling proved to be a huge advantage.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s totally different from playing close to home where your family gets to see you all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a new family, your team, when you\u2019re down there, and you get really close with them.\u201d\nWith such a commitment at hand, Flanagan decided to redshirt her junior year at BC. She wasn\u2019t the only Eagle to press the pause button on her college career. In fact, both Megan Keller and Cayla Barnes also took the year off. Barnes\u2014an incoming freshman at BC\u2014actually made the same move as Flanagan. The two ended up as roommates in Florida.\nBarnes immediately recognized Flanagan\u2019s abilities as a leader. It certainly wasn\u2019t Flanagan\u2019s first time put into the whirlwind of competitive tryouts, and she did her part to pass her wisdom down the ladder.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know anyone and she took me under her wing and was just a great role model for me during that whole process,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great presence in the locker room and on the ice. She kept things real fun and loose.\u201d\nYet, in a flashback to her U-18 tryout, Flanagan saw a massive list of the nation\u2019s best skaters get shorter and shorter. This time, though, hers remained on the sheet throughout the month of December.\nFor whatever twisted reason, the final cuts were to be made and announced on Christmas Day. For many of the athletes, their grueling four-month battle would end on what otherwise should have been the happiest day of the year. Fortunately for both Flanagan and Barnes, the two BC skaters would earn the best Christmas present they could have asked for: a spot on the 2018 Winter Olympic team.\n\u201cWhen we both found out when we were in that room it was just a really special moment to be able to share,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cNot only being first-time Olympians but the veterans too, they\u2019re just so happy for you.\u201d\nF\nor Flanagan, such an incredible moment didn\u2019t feel official until well after the team touched down in Seoul, South Korea.\n\u201cThe older girls told us that you\u2019re not a real Olympian until you take your first step on the ice,\u201d she said. \u201cYour first shift in the Olympics is only something you ever dream about as a little girl so to actually set foot on an Olympic ice sheet and to have the Team U.S.A. sweater on is just surreal, and priceless, and honestly just so hard to put into words.\u201d\nEven better were the results that Flanagan and Co. were getting on the ice, notably a 3-1 win over Finland and a 5-0 demolition of the Olympic athletes from Russia. The only blemish in the preliminary rounds for Team U.S.A. came in a 2-1 loss to Canada, but the two squads would inevitably meet again.\nAfter relocating its mojo in a 5-0 win over Finland in the semifinal game, Team U.S.A. faced Canada in a much anticipated rematch. Down one goal at the end of the second period, Flanagan remembers adrenaline bouncing off the walls of the locker room, but that the team managed to remain light and energetic, even cracking jokes throughout the intense intermission.\nMonique Lamoureux would end up extending the game with a goal in the waning minutes for Team U.S.A., and the two North American countries best known as bitter hockey rivals soon found themselves in an overtime shootout.\n\u201cIn the shootout we were sitting there arm\u2019s length just shaking,\u201d Flanagan said, \u201cand then when we won it was just absolutely insane. It was the coolest thing ever.\u201d\nThe gold medals received after the game would be the first for any American women\u2019s hockey player in 20 years. For the team to win the Games\u2019 most critical match against the nation that had beat them four years prior made the victory even sweeter.\n\u201cIn the shootout we were sitting there arm's length just shaking and then when we won, it was just absolutely insane. It was the coolest thing ever.\u201d \u2014 Kali Flanagan\nB\neyond the excitement from the win, Flanagan\u2019s stock as a celebrity rose, too. She remembers being in the airport, swarmed by fans who were amazed to catch a glimpse of some of Team U.S.A.\u2019s latest champions.\nIn fact, one of the team\u2019s biggest fans was BC women\u2019s hockey coach Katie Crowley, who was in contact with five of her former and current players throughout their time in Florida and South Korea.\nA gold medal winner herself, Crowley\u2019s pride in her players came from knowing just how amazing the moment was. Having missed out on their contributions that season on the ice at Kelley Rink, though, she was just as happy to have them back in Chestnut Hill.\n\u201cI thought they did such a good job of representing BC in their journey, and we couldn\u2019t wait to see them when they came back and give them all big hugs,\u201d Crowley said with a laugh. \u201cAfter that it was like \u2018Alright, so when do you guys come back to our team?\u2019\u201d\nFlanagan, too, knows that the taste of victory on the world stage isn\u2019t the end of the line for her. The end goal of winning it all is the same, but this time the hope is that the banner will be raised within the confines of Conte Forum. After all, at least for Kali Flanagan, there\u2019s no place like home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to be back at Boston College,\u201d Flanagan said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s, like, the best place on earth.\u201d\nFeatured Image by Lizzy Barrett \/ Heights Senior Staff\nImages by Bradley Smart \/ Heights Editor\nprint\n}}

{{BEIJING -- During the Summer Olympics, which begin here today, IT departments at some U.S. companies could face network-straining levels of traffic as employees tune into video feeds from NBC.\nIt's never been easy for fans of sports such as archery and field hockey during the Olympics--the TV networks just didn't give such niche sports the prime-time love showered on swimming, gymnastics and other popular events. But this time around, NBC has been making much of its plan to stream more than 2200 hours of live events via its Web site, and provide 3000 additional hours of on-demand video during the Beijing Games beginning on Friday, Aug. 8.\nThis is great news for anyone who wants to start the workday by grabbing a coffee and catching up on team handball from the comfort of his or her cubicle. It's not so great for IT departments that are anticipating the spike in traffic over corporate networks, says Steve Schick, a spokesman for Blue Coat Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., which sells secure Web gateway systems that manage what employees can see, filter malware and control bandwidth demand.\nBefore this year's Games, one of the largest sports-related resource hogs has been CBSSports.com's March Madness on Demand broadband package for the already high-tech NCAA basketball tournament. The programming attracted more than 4.76 million unique viewers in 2008, up 164 percent from a more limited schedule of games a year ago.\nWhile some companies may simply block the video feeds, others according to Schick will cache content to reduce strain on the network--the company would actually store video requested by an employee on local servers, for viewing by other employees.\nUSA's Marvell Wynne (right) runs against Cameroon's Alain Olle Olle during a warm up tournament ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games in Hong Kong.

{{sport, local-sport, NPL, Rockdale City Suns, Sutherland Sharks, 1-0, Sydney Olympic\nA physical approach has helped Sutherland produce a stunning upset to start the NPL 1 season, downing defending champions Sydney Olympic 1-0 on Sunday. The Sharks, who finished 10th out of 12 teams last season, faced arguably the most daunting fixture of the opening round with a trip to Belmore Sports Ground to tackle Olympic. Boosted by new signings Mateo Poljak, Marc Warren, Tarik Erkan, Raul Romero and Juan Carlos Romero as well as Anthony Bouzanis in goal, the new-look Sharks were noticeably physical and aggressive with and without the ball. The tactic seemed to unsettle the hosts as Sutherland defended strongly throughout the first half. Jeremy Cox, who returned to the club from Sydney FC, came off the bench in the second half for Sutherland and provided their winner in the 70th minute. Juan Carlos Romero slid the ball through for Cox who finished passed Olympic goalkeeper Paul Henderson. The Sharks held on for the final 20 minutes, allowing new coach Terry Palapanis the chance to celebrate the perfect start to the season. \u201cIt was tough, exactly how we expected,\u201d Palapanis said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very good side Olympic, they\u2019re the reigning champions. \u201cWe had to make it physical otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be leaving with three points.\u201d At Edensor Park, Rockdale City overcame the loss of Sasa Macura when he was sent off after half an hour to earn a 0-0 draw against bitter rivals Sydney United 58. Midfielder Macura, who joined Rockdale from Manly in the summer, was shown a red card for two bookable offences. Both sides created chances in a match that could have gone either way. Suns coach Paul Reid said he was proud of his side as they held on for an hour with 10 men. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy playing with 10 men, especially away from home. It was very hot out there and for the effort that the boys put in I am very proud of them,\" Reid said. \u201cI said to them at half-time that if we defended like we did we will create a couple of chances. If it was 11 vs 11 we would have gone on and won the game, I know that. \u201cAll in all, we were unlucky not to nick one at the end. We\u2019ll take the point and look forward to next week against Marconi.\u201d Sutherland host Hakoah Sydney City East in their first home game of the season at Seymour Shaw Park on Saturday night.

Golf is part of the games this year for the first time in more than a century, but many of the big names from both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s pro tours are choosing not to travel to Brazil because of the Zika virus.\nAs always, there are serious questions about how ready the Olympic facilities will be, and there are very serious concerns about water quality, both at the aquatic venues and coming out of the taps at the athletes\u2019 village.\nRio is a fabulous place to party on the beach, but there\u2019s a lot of crime, and competitors say they probably won\u2019t be doing much sightseeing.\nThen there are the Russians. Many of their top competitors have been disqualified for doping violations, putting athletes from many countries under a dark cloud of suspicion.\nA decade ago, a news organization like the dear old CBC would be having a veritable feast reporting on all these sordid stories and more. But today, in the vanishing world of real journalism, even the Corporation is very limited in what they can say. Our public broadcaster paid millions to bring the events in Rio to Canadian living rooms and smart devices, and they dare not offend the Olympic brass, or the corporate sponsors who are paying the bills.\nAs I always say, other than that, Rio should be just one laugh after another.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nRoger Currie is a writer, storyteller, voice for hire, observer of life on the Canadian prairies, and can be heard on CJNU 93.7FM in Winnipeg.\nAdvertisements\n0 Shares\nTrending Videos\nRelated\nComments\ncomments\n}}

{{The buzz around Canadian figure skating at the Olympics in South Korea is building for 12-year-old Jake Ellis of Essex who hopes one day to compete in the Winter Games.\n\u201cIt definitely has grown as a sport,\u201d Ellis said Wednesday of the skating events that look more promising for Canada at the Games that start Feb. 9.\n\u201cThis year I feel like there\u2019s going to be a lot more people wanting to watch the skating because they see the figure skaters holding the flag and everything.\u201d\nCanada is sending 17 skaters, the largest figure skating contingent from any country, has a couple medal hopes, and gold medal ice dance skaters Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue will carry the Canadian flag into the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Stadium. The pair is from Ilderton near London, Ont., and Virtue is a former University of Windsor student.\nEllis and fellow members of the South Windsor Skating Club met a couple of the figure skaters \u2014 including Patrick Chan \u2014 who will compete in the Games, which has added to the growing excitement.\nMarlena Kovacevich-Connor, South Windsor Skating Club\u2019s technical coordinator, said this year\u2019s Winter Games in South Korea are one of the most anticipated in the skating community.\nThe club recently made a video to enter a Skate Ontario contest and boost spirits for the Olympics.\n\u201cWe always tend to see a surge in Olympic years,\u201d she said.\nThe club has about 547 skaters, including many in its learn-to-skate programs, and by the end of the year could reach about 700 members even if it wasn\u2019t an Olympic year, she said.\nThe prize for the best video based on the number of Facebook shares and likes is $250 at the Skate Ontario online store but the video, which was shot with a drone with skaters in their Olympic-related gear, was more about cheering on Canada.\nEllis won a bronze medal in December at the Skate Canada Challenge in Montreal, putting him among the top skaters in the country for boys 10 to 16 years old. He\u2019ll compete at the Ontario Winter Games in March.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping for Patrick Chan, I\u2019m hoping he does pretty well,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favourites.\u201d\nKovacevich-Connor said many of the boys want to be Patrick Chan and the girls want to be Virtue, Kaetlyn Osmond or Gabby Daleman.\nKovacevich-Connor organized the video entry with Lori Lafferty-Vilneff and Aphelion Media volunteered to do the video for the club. So far the video on Skate Ontario\u2019s Facebook page has the most likes and shares but club members want people to keep sharing the video this week and next week to win.\nshill@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/winstarhill\n}}

{{The ultimate dream for long-track speed skater Cedrick Brunet is to compete at the Winter Olympic Games.\nHe was a Winter Olympics spectator at the 2010 Vancouver Games, where as a nine-year-old he was exposed to and embraced speed skating.\nHe\u2019s quite familiar with family members \u2014 father, mother, aunt and uncle \u2014 representing Canada at the Olympics, their inspiring stories and their varying degrees of success and achievements.\nBut now he wants his turn to build on that family tradition. Brunet, 18, is heading in that direction, after winning two silvers and one bronze medal in his six races during the opening week of the Canada Winter Games in Red Deer, Alta.\nBrunet was one of three triple medal winners from the National Capital Region squad, while representing Quebec during the opening week of the Games. There was no competition Saturday as the first week\u2019s athletes headed home to make room for the competitors of the second week. Competition is scheduled to resume Sunday.\nGatineau artistic swimmer Mikaelle Gauthier and Ottawa table tennis player Ann Shiao also earned three trips to the podium to highlight the region\u2019s first-week showing of one gold, 10 silver and four bronze medals.\nQuebec has a commanding lead in the medal table after the first week with 31 gold, 27 silver and 27 bronze for 85 total. Alberta is second (16-17-11-44) and Ontario is third (8-20-14-42).\nThe Games are the breeding ground for the future wave of Canada\u2019s high-performance athletes, who will represent Canada at multi-sport Games, such as the Olympics.\n\u201cI want to go to the Olympics because it\u2019s a family thing,\u201d said Brunet, who won his silver medals on the second day of speed skating in the 500 metres (a two-race combined time of 1:15.27, winning the first race in 37.46 seconds) and 3,200-metre team pursuit (4:16.28). He earned bronze on the final day in a re-run of the 4,000-metre mass start (5:46.565).\n\u201cThis experience prepares you to be a top athlete. I\u2019ve got my father telling me what to do and my aunt and uncle are helping me to get setup to be a high-performance athlete.\u201d\nSix-time Canadian silver medallist Michel Brunet, who is Cedrick\u2019s father, competed at the 1998 Olympics in figure skating\u2019s ice dance with Chantal Lefebvre. His mother Brigitte Gauthier has attended five Winter Games as a physiotherapist for the freestyle skiing team.\nCedrick\u2019s aunt is Jennifer Heil, who won gold and silver medals, respectively, at the 2006 and 2010 Games in women\u2019s freestyle skiing moguls. His uncle and Heil\u2019s husband is Dominick Gauthier, who was a freestyle skiing coach at the 1998 Olympics.\nCedrick Brunet\u2019s on-ice performance was remarkable. Skating on an outdoor oval was a relatively new experience for him as he is more accustomed to training short-track speed skating in an arena. But he managed to handle the cold and wind, wearing a neck warmer for extra protection.\n\u201cIt was completely different. But I focused on myself \u2026 and didn\u2019t think about the cold and wind,\u201d said Brunet, who had to contend with a temperature of minus-29C one day.\nUnlike Brunet, Gauthier and Shiao crafted their success in the warmth of a pool and gym, respectively.\nGauthier, who moved to Dollard Synchro in Montreal three years ago because of its national program and strong coaching, was a model of consistency. She was the silver medallist in solo (157.5852 points), duet with Audrey Veilleux of Saint-Jerome (155.8312), and in team.\n\u201cI swam very well and I\u2019m happy with the results,\u201d said Gauthier, who was seeded fourth in singles. \u201cWe worked on all of our routines since June and all the work paid off.\n\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed I didn\u2019t win gold. I swam my best performances.\u201d\nShiao battled her way to the medal podium for three silvers in her three competitions. Ontario opened the team event losing to Quebec and British Columbia before defeating Saskatchewan and Quebec to reach the gold-medal match. B.C. defeated Ontario 3-1 in the final.\nIn singles, Shiao, who is coached by former Olympian Lijuan Geng and her husband, former international player Horatio Pintea, at the Geng Table Tennis Academy, turned back two-thirds of the strong B.C. team, but lost to Benita Zhou in the final, 11-3, 11-9, 13-15, 11-4.\nShiao, a member of the national table tennis shadow squad and junior 18 team, and Jin Wu, who played in the 2015 Canada Winter Games for Saskatchewan, were silver medallists in women\u2019s doubles, falling to British Columbia\u2019s Jiayi Nie and Zhou 11-9, 11-5, 11-3.\n\u201cI did a lot of mental preparation before the Games,\u201d Shiao said. \u201cI tried to take the pressure off myself and focus on doing my best.\u201d\nQuebec won its first ringette gold medal at the Games and Gatineau Fusion players Sara Plouffe (captain, opening ceremony flagbearer), Julie Vandal and Melissa Demers shared in the celebration, after edging undefeated Ontario 4-3 in overtime.\nVandal, who was the Games\u2019 top point scorer with 11 goals and 13 assists, scored the game-winning goal in overtime on a powerplay. Plouffe ranked third on the scoring list with 10 goals and 11 assists.\n\u201cWe worked so hard all week for this medal,\u201d Plouffe told Sportcom. \u201cThis moment is indescribable.\u201d\nOntario\u2019s silver-medal-winning roster included Ottawa\u2019s Emma Kelly, who scored eight goals and added four assists in seven preliminary and playoff games, Ottawa\u2019s Liza Roik (3-5-8), Kanata\u2019s Marta Matuszewski (1-2-3), Arnprior\u2019s Paige Miller (6-6-12) and Ottawa\u2019s Rachael Pelisek (played in three games as a goalkeeper, 2-0).\nOliver Holder picked up the National Capital Region\u2019s other gold medal, when he helped Quebec to a first-place finish in the men\u2019s 3\u00d77.5-kilometre biathlon relay.\nQuebec won its first men\u2019s hockey gold medal at the Games since 1987, shading Ontario 4-3 in overtime.\nAccepting silver medals were Ontario associate captains Brandt Clarke of Ottawa (two goals, seven assists for nine points in six games) and Connor Lockhart of Kanata (4-3-7), Mason McTavish of Pembroke (2-2-4), Isaac Enright of Cobden (0-2-2) and Patrick Leaver of Perth (played one game as a goalkeeper, 1-0).\n\u201cUnfortunate outcome finishing second, but still an amazing experience from top to bottom,\u201d Clarke posted on Twitter. \u201cI just want to thank everyone who helped put it together as these memories we\u2019ve made will truly stick with me for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe National Capital region\u2019s other silver medallists were Piaper Veinotte, Chelsea, Team Quebec, women\u2019s 3\u00d76-kilometre biathlon relay; and Sabrina Chen, Ottawa, Team Ontario, table tennis mixed doubles.\nComing home with bronze medals were Lucas Craston of Ottawa in boxing men\u2019s 60 kilograms; Noah Bouma of Ottawa in long-track speed skating men\u2019s team pursuit; and Jade Warren and Emma Fox, Ottawa, on the artistic swimming team.\nALSO IN THE NEWS:\nRyan Dzingel sent packing as the changes continue\nA big night for the Tkachuk family as Brady and Matt face off in Ottawa\nGAME DAY: Calgary Flames at Ottawa Senators\n}}

{{by Tom Utescher\nPreseason training trips don\u2019t get better than this. Before assembling for their first official practice last Thursday, 18 members of the men\u2019s soccer team at Chestnut Hill College went on an eight-day jaunt to England, taking in two semi-final contests at the Olympic Games and playing several \u201cfriendly\u201d matches against British club teams.\nThe Griffins were in the stands for the France vs. Japan women\u2019s semifinal in London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, and for the men\u2019s semifinal bout between Brazil and South Korea.\nThe men\u2019s match took place at Old Trafford, home pitch of the storied Manchester United franchise, and the CHC players also visited Arsenal Football Club\u2019s Emirates Stadium. Of course, sightseeing and shopping in London were also on the itinerary.\n\u201cFirst off, it was a great team-building trip,\u201d said Keith Cappo, the Penn Charter graduate who is entering his third season as Chestnut Hill\u2019s head coach. \u201cFor that whole week we were doing everything together. Another important aspect was for our guys to experience the soccer culture over there; their mentality and approach to the game, how hard they work, how physical the game is.\n\u201cA lot of our players have been fans of these English teams for years, and now they got to see where they play and practice first-hand,\u201d the coach continued. \u201cI think we progressively improved as we played our matches, and the guys gained a new appreciation for being able to be a part of this sport. They also enjoyed the social aspect after the matches, talking with their players.\u201d\nCappo brought along 16 field players and two goalies, and the team squared off against Ashton Athletic Football Club in Liverpool, Harborough Town Football Club, and Lutterworth Athletic Football Club. At several of the clubs, coaches explained how they train their young players step-by-step, starting at the age of five.\nSenior Mike Goldstein, a starter in goal since his freshman year, related that when the Griffins actually took the field, \u201cThe one thing we noticed right away was how physical they play over there. It took us off-guard and the first five minutes we really got knocked around, but then our guys showed their character, and matched what they were doing.\u201d\nThe CHC keeper said, \u201cThere was a very professional atmosphere around those clubs, and even some of their younger guys are getting paid to play. It was fun to talk with them after the games and compare the way the game is played in England and back home.\u201d\nCappo didn\u2019t mind his players having to endure a few bumps and bruises.\n\u201cThat physical aspect is something we\u2019ve struggled with even in our games here,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis really forced our guys to step up and improve in that part of the game, and I\u2019m hoping some of that will carry over to our season. The other part of it is that their officials let you play more, let the games flow. The refs we had were all superb; they view their job as facilitating the game, not interfering with it.\u201d\nGoldstein said, \u201cI think it really all hit me when I got back, that I\u2019d gotten to see all of these amazing places I\u2019d heard about. I remember when we were at Arsenal\u2019s stadium and watching Bobby Stocklin [a CHC junior forward], who is a huge Arsenal fan. His face just lit up \u2013 he was so happy to be there.\u201d\nTurning to the college season ahead, Cappo is looking for goal productions from forwards like Stocklin to compensate for the graduation loss of Scottish native Gavin Reid, an all-conference player who finished with 27 points in 2011. Returning attackers include seniors Darryl Richardson (three goals\/three assists) and Mark Pugliese (two goals, three assists), and junior Mushe Wamulume (three goals, two assists).\nThe offense will also get a boost from the return of senior Anthony O\u2019Connor, who red-shirted last fall after getting hurt very early in the season. The Griffins will also see junior Ross Garabedian back in action; he too, sat out the 2011 campaign for medical reasons. He\u2019ll be part of a defensive unit incorporating juniors Brooks Mirabella and Darius Gbunblee and sophomore Dave Schlentz. Senior Mark Pugliese and junior Chris Wilson will bring a lot of experience and skill to the CHC midfield.\nOut of the seven new players on the Chestnut Hill roster this season, five are junior college transfer students who should be ready to contribute immediately.\nOutside of formidable opponents in Chestnut Hill\u2019s own Central Atlantic College Conference (where defending champ Nyack College in suburban New York has most of its top talent returning), Cappo has scheduled some Division II competition from the Pa. State Athletic Conference, such as Shippensburg, Lock Haven, and California of Pa. West Virginia\u2019s Shepherd University is also a new addition to the agenda.\nA few more wins this fall could push CHC into winning territory in the CACC, where the team went 4-7 last season, and also in terms of its overall record, which was 7-10-1 in 2011. Following a tournament at Shippensburg, the Griffins will open up at home against New York\u2019s Mercy College at 4:00 PM on September 4, at Victory Field in Lafayette Hill.\n}}

{{By Dominic Patten\nAMC\nThere were a number of goodbyes uttered Sunday night as the XXIII Winter Games came to an end, as did the life of Carl Grimes on The Walking Dead. However, unlike the near lows of NBC\u2019s Closing Ceremony in PyeongChang, the AMC zombie apocalypse series based on Robert Kirkman\u2019s comics has some celebrating to do.\nWith a 3.6 rating among adults 18-49, the often-heartbreaking winter return episode of TWD\u2019s eighth season topped the fireworks and K-Pop extravaganza of the Olympics closer by 20% in the key demo. That is a 20% victory overall against the Closing Ceremony, which aired tape-delayed from 8-10:31 PM ET, and it\u2019s a 20% victory over the Olympics in the 9-10:30 PM ET slot where the TWD winter return went head-to-head with the NBC broadcast.\nAdding to the victory is the fact that this is the second time in a row that TWD has taken the gold over the Closing Ceremony of a Winter Olympics. In late February 2014, the Season 4 winter return of Dead also buried the Closing Ceremony of the Sochi Games.\nIn a season that not only has seen the loss of the Chandler Riggs-portrayed core character but ratings as well, the still-blockbuster TWD also snagged an uptick of 8% in 18-49s over its \u201cHow It\u2019s Gotta Be\u201d winter finale of December 10.\nOverall, the February 25 \u201cHonor\u201d episode of TWD delivered 8.3 million viewers, with 4.7 million in the 18-49 demo and 5.2 million in the 25-54 demo. For comparison, the XXIII Winter Games Closing Ceremony pulled in 14.8 million viewers on NBC overall.\nHaving said that, the ninth episode of Dead\u2019s eighth season was down 37% from the Season 7 winter return on February 12, 2017, which was up against the Grammys. That\u2019s a hard drop in a Season 8 of several ratings hits and lows from once-record-breaking heights for TWD.\nIn fact, this year\u2019s winter return looks to be a low of its own for the series; this past Sunday dipped just below the Season 2 winter return results of February 12, 2012, which had 8.1 million total viewers with 5.4 million in the 18-49 demo.\nStill, with TWD already renewed for a ninth season, and perhaps with a few more pickups for AMC\u2019s biggest show, we could see this battle again in 2022 when the Winter Olympics take place in Beijing \u2013 who will be taking a bite out of whom then?\n}}

{{The head of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee has been charged in Paris for \u201cactive corruption\u201d in connection with the awarding of the 2020 Olympics to Tokyo, a judicial official told AFP. Tsunekazu Takeda was indicted on December 10 by investigating magistrates looking into a suspect payment of 2.8 million Singapore dollars ($2.3 million) made before the Japanese capital was chosen to host the Olympics, the source said Friday.\nTokyo beat Madrid and Istanbul in the 2013 vote.\nTakeda, a former Olympic showjumper who led the country\u2019s campaign for the Games, said he had cooperated with a French judge looking into the matter, adding: \u201cI was not involved in any wrongdoing such as bribery.\u201d\nThe 71-year-old, who is a member of the International Olympics Committee (IOC), added that \u201cwrong information that I was indicted has been shared,\u201d and pledged he would \u201ccooperate with investigations to clear up any doubts.\u201d\nTakeda was \u201cmis en examen\u201d by the French magistrates, a legal step that has no direct equivalent in the American or British legal systems, but roughly translates as being charged.\nIt does not automatically trigger a trial, but it means that prosecutors believe there is strong or corroborated evidence of wrongdoing.\nThe French investigation, launched in 2016, relates to two payments made to Singapore-based Black Tidings, a firm linked to Papa Massata Diack, son of the Senegalese former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), Lamine Diack.\nThe younger Diack, formerly a marketing advisor to the IAAF, has been accused of accepting bribes.\nThe funds, labelled \u201cTokyo 2020 Olympic Game Bid\u201d, were paid from a Japanese bank account.\nThe payments were made in two stages, before and after the IOC vote that decided the host city.\nFrance is investigating the case because funds involved might have been laundered in France.\nShortly after accusations first surfaced, the Japanese Olympic committee appointed a three-man judicial panel to look into the matter. The panel reportedly cleared the campaign committee of any wrongdoing in September 2016.\nAt the time, Japanese Olympic officials said the suspect funds were owed for \u201cthe legitimate payment of a consultant\u201d, adding that no one was aware of a link between Black Tidings and Papa Massata Diack.\nPapa Massata Diack, known as PMD, is suspected of having received several million euros in bribes, either for sponsorship contracts or to favour the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.\nMassata Diack has been on Interpol\u2019s most-wanted list since December 2015 but the Senegalese government refuses to extradite him to France.\nLast month, IOC President Thomas Bach formally requested that Senegal cooperate with French authorities investigating the corruption claims.\n\u2013 Senegal connection \u2013\nThe French investigation comes at a tricky time in Franco-Japanese relations which have been strained by the shock arrest of car industry boss Carlos Ghosn in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges.\nGhosn\u2019s arrest has exposed rifts in the alliance he forged and led between Japanese vehicle makers Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, and France\u2019s Renault, which is partly owned by the French state.\nA spokesman for the Japanese embassy in Paris, Yoshihiro Higuchi, said the Japanese government was unaware that Takeda was being investigated.\nNews of the indictment as Japanese Olympics Minister Yoshitaka Sakurada visited Paris to hold talks with representatives of the 2024 Paris Olympics organising committee.\nThe French probe was launched in the wake of allegations of wide-scale corruption involving the IAAF, which was initially accused of helping Russian athletes evade sanctions imposed for failing doping tests.\nA spokesperson for the International Olympics Committee (IOC) said Friday it was monitoring the situation.\n\u201cMr Takeda continues to enjoy the full presumption of innocence,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nAllegations under investigation \u201crefer to events before the IOC introduced far-reaching reforms,\u201d the spokesperson also said, adding that Olympic consultants were now fully vetted.\n}}

{{Mumbai: Google Inc. certainly has a sweet tooth when it comes to naming its operating system (OS) versions. After KitKat, we now have its latest Android L or 5.0, officially called Lollipop\u2014an update that will offer Google\u2019s new material design features, improved battery life, enhanced security features and smarter notifications.\nAnd Google is no baby to part with, or have competitors snatch, this candy. Having captured nearly 80% of the global smartphone and tablet OS market, Lollipop will only help it strengthen its presence in the global devices market, extending Google\u2019s reach to the living room in a post-PC (personal computer) era by powering watches and eventually televisions and cars too\u2014an area which Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. too have been eyeing for the last few years.\nTo begin with, Android Lollipop will debut on the Nexus 6 smartphone, Nexus 9 tablet, and the Nexus Player streaming media device. By the end of the year, Google hopes to have Lollipop on the Nexus 4, 5, 7, 10, and Google Play edition devices too.\nThis latest version of Android brings Google\u2019s material design features that introduce a colourful and responsive user interface design for a consistent, intuitive experience across all your devices.\nNot all these features are new. They have been implemented by many Android device makers over the last one year. What Google is doing is to ensure that the seamless syncing experience, which Apple devices are known for, become part of the core Android experience too.\nWith Lollipop, for instance, users will be able to view and respond to messages directly from the lock screen. The OS includes the ability to hide sensitive content for these notifications. And for fewer disruptions, one can turn on the \u201cpriority\" mode via the device\u2019s volume button. Also, there\u2019s a more intelligent ranking of notifications based on who they\u2019re from and the type of communication. Users can also see all notifications in one place by tapping the top of the screen.\nSome material design features can be seen in the recent updates that Google has released for its own Android apps such as Google+. More importantly, Lollipop includes a battery saver feature which extends device use by up to 90 minutes. And all new devices will come with encryption automatically turned on to help protect data on lost or stolen devices.\nLollipop also provides for power-efficient scanning for nearby Bluetooth low energy devices like wearables or beacons. It also brings over 5,000 new application programming interfaces for developers to use.\nAndroid continues to dominate the global smartphone market with over 255 million units shipped and nearly 85% of the market share in the June quarter of 2014, according to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC). Most of Android\u2019s strength in that quarter was fuelled by gains in the low ($100\u2014less than $200) and ultra low-end (less than $100) of the market, seeing those categories grow 16.5% sequentially since the March quarter.\nApple\u2019s iOS experienced a slight drop in market share, down to just 11.7% in the June quarter of 2014 from 13% in the same quarter last year, representing the growing shift of demand towards low-cost smartphones, said IDC. The Windows Phone had a mere 2.5% market share in the same period.\nAndroid is also a leader in worldwide device shipments by OS in mature markets with a 46.6% share in 2014, according to research firm Gartner Inc. It\u2019s also number one in worldwide device shipments by OS in emerging markets with a 53.39% share in 2014. Mature markets include the US, Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Emerging markets include Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan), Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\nWorldwide combined shipments of devices\u2014PCs, tablets, ultra-mobiles and mobile phones\u2014for 2014 are estimated to reach 2.4 billion units, a 3.2% increase from 2013.\nThe mobile phone segment, said Gartner, will continue to grow in 2014 due to strong sales of cheap smartphones. As smartphones cost less, Gartner expects nine out of 10 phones to be smartphones by 2018.\nIt\u2019s here that Google will score more points with Android L\u2019s experience, since Apple is not present in the rapidly growing low-cost phone segment.\nIn 2015, Gartner estimates that shipments of Android devices will reach over one billion in emerging markets, driven by sales of lower-cost products. Even the Android One phones (launched on 15 September), running the latest version of Android (4.4 KitKat), will be some of the first phones to get the new Android Lollipop release.\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s new devices, which target the premium market, will continue to help drive iOS volumes.\nAccording to a 13 October note by Forrester Research, more dramatic improvements such as a larger screen or a more dramatic redesign \u201cwill have to wait until next year, but expect Apple to emphasize the Handoff feature of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite that makes it possible to start something on the iPad, switch to the Mac, and have it jump right into the right app and activity that you were doing on the iPad\".\n}}

{{Google is adding its Assistant to its Android Messages app\nAndroid is Google's operating system that is incredibly popular. In fact, the mobile software far surpasses iOS in terms of users across the globe. Android is regularly updated by Google, meaning fresh functionality and improvements are consistently introduced. A new upgrade for the operating system has been discussed by the firm that will bring the Google Assistant to the firm's Messages app.\nThe introduction of the virtual helper will allow it to display contextual information within a text messaging thread. Essentially, if an Android fan is messaging another user to ask if they would like to see a film, the Google Assistant will understand the movie being discussed and will offer a \"suggestion chip\" that will present additional information. If the user presses the suggestion chip, they will be taken to an overlay page that discusses the film in question and gives access to its trailer, release date and more. Of course, this is just one example in which the Assistant could be helpful. Once the user has seen the information, they are able to send it to the person they are texting if they want them to also see the additional text. Discussing the integration of the Google Assistant into its Messages application, Google said: \"Conversations are another place where the Google Assistant can lend a helping hand.\n\"Over the coming months for English users around the globe, Messages will start showing suggestions so you can get more information from the Google Assistant about movies, restaurants and weather.\" The Mountain View firm has insisted the new technology will be harnessed on devices locally, meaning user text messages will not be sent to it. Moreover, The Verge has also stated Google's servers will only receive the information from the suggestion chip chosen. Google went on: \"The Messages app uses on-device AI to offer suggestion chips relevant to your conversation, helping you easily find and share information as you chat one-on-one with your best friend, or in a group chat with your entire family.\nThe Google Assistant will display contextual information for users\nGoogle has insisted the new technology will be harnessed on devices locally\n}}

{{Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nAfter a five-year hiatus, Alien: Covenant is primed to continue Ridley Scott's Alien prequel series that started with Prometheus. These films will fill in the gaps about who made the Xenomorph and why, striving to have a stronger connection to Scott's seminal 1979 horror classic than Prometheus did. Scott is already teasing a Covenant sequel that should begin filming at some point next year, so he obviously has high hopes for his latest work.\nMost of the crew of the Prometheus were killed off but Michael Fassbender returns. Not only is the Oscar-nominee playing android David from Prometheus, he is handling dual roles as a new robot model, Walter. Whereas David traveled aboard the Prometheus, Walter arrives at a world that looks like paradise aboard the Covenant along with the rest of the colonization crew.\nWith both models of android running around, 20th Century Fox has unveiled a new promotional clip and website showcasing Walter, which was teased previously. The clip is similar to the video that introduced the David 8 model during the Prometheus viral campaign. The promo was directed by Luke Scott based on an idea by his father Ridley Scott and 3AM. Much of the video features the creation of the new android which is billed as, \"the world\u2019s most advanced synthetic companion, designed to help you achieve a better human experience.\" It then invites you to visit the fictional site MeetWalter.com which details Walter's features - such as cognitive processing and emotional intelligence.\nNear the end of the promo, there are some small disclaimer texts which say that a matchmaking interview and DNA screening is required and that Walter \"imprints\" on whoever he serves. The warning about genetic abnormalities is also pretty intriguing and seems to indicate there's some sort of medical requirement in order to purchase one. It also leaves us with the lingering question of just who on the crew of the Covenant Walter has imprinted on. The viral website also features a link which allows you to \"reserve your Walter today\" and syncs with your Facebook account, presumably to keep fans in the loop via additional viral material.\nThe video has a bit of a Westworld vibe to, it featuring a lot of white plastic looking material. It isn't the first time we've seen inside the androids, as the Alien franchise has given us a peek inside before, but it tends to be after they've been decapitated or torn apart by a Xenomorph. Fassbender himself was one of the shining pieces of the uneven Prometheus and looks like he'll be in fine form with Alien: Covenant.\nPrometheus was visually stunning, but its story left quite a bit to be desired for some moviegoers. It seems that Ridley Scott and the rest of the creative team are working hard to correct the issues of that first film with Alien: Covenant, and hopefully they succeed and deliver another thrilling and horrifying installment in this long-running franchise. Scott intends to keep it going as long as possible, so ideally Covenant will be a massive hit.\nAlien: Covenant will arrive in theaters on May 19, 2017.\nSource: YouTube\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Honest Trailer - Light on Beasts\n}}

{{The conventional wisdom for app makers has been that you start on iOS (s aapl) to make money and then move over to Android (s goog). But New York City-based fitness app maker Noom, one of Kleiner Perkins\u2019 iFund companies, has stuck to Android and the results have paid off with Noom earning the top grossing spot for health apps with its Noom Weight Loss Coach.\nThe plan was to push out an iOS app by the holidays, but Noom backed off when it wasn\u2019t able to hit the quality level it was looking for. Instead, the company is announcing Tuesday it has raised $2.6 million in additional seed funding as it looks to build out its team and nail its iOS strategy.\n\u201cBecause we respect iOS, we know how rich it is, so when we go there, we want to provide a good impression,\u201d said Noom\u2019s CEO Saeju Jeong. \u201cWe believe the best strategy for marketing is having a quality product, but right now, it\u2019s hard to match what we\u2019re providing on the Android platform.\u201d\nThe new pre-Series A funding comes from mobile-focused UK venture firm m8 Capital and Sangbeom Kim, co-founder of Korean game maker Nexon, and includes follow-on investments from Qualcomm Ventures (s qcom) and Harbor Pacific Capital. Jeong told he was looking to raise just enough money to get to a proper Series A while the company pushes out its first iOS apps in the first quarter of 2013. Noom previously raised $2 million from Kleiner and other investors.\nJeong said the company, previously named WorkSmart Labs, is already making good money with its $9.99 premium version of the app, which provides extra coaching and guidance for users. As I wrote about earlier, Noom\u2019s secret has been to build an app for casual users that de-emphasizes data input and instead provides a lot of analytics and coaching lessons and tips. The company now has 15 million downloads of its apps, split mostly between Noom Weight Loss Coach and Cardio Trainer. It says it has helped its users collectively lose 19 million pounds since launching.\nJeong started the company with ex-Googler Artem Petakov, who founded the user-created maps project for Google Maps. The company is now up to 14 people, including four former Google workers, and just opened up an office in South Korea, where it also released a localized version of Noom Weight Loss Coach.\nJeong said his vision is to not just limit Noom to the app market, but ultimately break into other channels to potentially sell tangible goods or establish cross promotion deals.\n}}

{{The Google Nexus 7 has become one of the most popular seven inch tablets since it was first released, and last week to coincide with all the new Nexus hardware becoming available Google starting rolling out the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean update to the older Nexus devices. Trouble is there have been numerous problems discussed by owners of the Nexus 7 since updating the firmware.\nIt seems that a growing number of Nexus 7 owners are experiencing a variety of issues after updating their device to the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean firmware, with the main issue being a flaky Bluetooth connection. That not to say there aren\u2019t other problems with the new software, as we have been told by some of our readers that they have experienced the device suddenly rebooting itself unexpectedly.\nThere have also been complaints of faster battery drain in some cases along with a sudden lag with the Nexus 7 that wasn\u2019t present before the update. This is slightly similar to what was experienced by owners of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus previously when their handset kept rebooting itself without warning, and many will remember the volume bug that caused the device to suddenly go silent during a call.\nIt\u2019s a shame that the tablet PC is currently experiencing these issues as hardware wise it\u2019s a great device, and some owners have seen the problems with updating to Android 4.2 but are holding off for now. The only trouble is that they have to put up with constant prompts about updating to the new firmware, but that\u2019s better than having a device riddled with bugs.\nSome users though are saying they are having no issues with their device at all after updating, so the problems may be related to certain apps installed on the tablet conflicting with the operating system. Hopefully Google will quickly address the issue and release a patch for the device and clear all the bugs.\nHave you held off updating to Android 4.2 until Google irons out all the problems?\n}}

{{After Siri\u2019s release alongside the iPhone 4S last month, blogs scrambled to suggest Siri alternatives that can function on Android. It\u2019s a noble enough goal, but the fact is that Siri is the most advanced technology of its kind, offering an unprecedented blend of quality voice recognition and AI. However, Android fans may still be able to get in on some Siri action, as some ambitious developers have cracked Siri\u2019s security protocol, opening the door to potential Android (and other OS) ports.\nThe developers cracked Siri by setting up a fake HTTPS server, a fake DNS server, and some equally bogus SSL certification. They deciphered the VoIP codec that Siri uses to transfer voice data, the extensive chatter that takes place between Apple\u2019s server and the client, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the signature identifier.\nThat signature is the most critical element in any Siri ports. As with the jailbreak ports of Siri to other iOS devices, there is a live identifier token that must be lifted from an iPhone 4S. Without this token, Apple\u2019s servers will reject the request. But once this token is obtained, Siri can potentially run on pretty much anything.\nThe live token, however, also presents some big obstacles. For starters, it makes an iPhone 4S necessary for the port. If you already have a 4S, there is far less motivation to port Siri to something else. What\u2019s more, distributing the token would be a) considered piracy, and b) asking for trouble from Apple. If tons of IP addresses are seen using the same token simultaneously, Apple could throw down the ban hammer.\nOf course, this won\u2019t likely stop the development community from going to town. The Siri crackers are planning on posting tools to help other devs do their own Siri port work. If you\u2019re up for risking Apple\u2019s wrath, you can check them out after they\u2019re posted at the (first) source link below.\nMore at Applidium, via The Next Web\n}}

{{The Large Hadron Collider scares me.

LHSee (heh) for Android shows you what's happening inside the LHC.\nWhat's it do?\nIf you ever wanted to learn more about what the Large Hadron Collider at CERN actually does, LHSee fills you in. It shows live data inside the particle accelerator in a 3D view, you can even see protons collide with one another. The 3D View, of course, isn't some live video look in of the LHC, you're looking at 3D models here, but you can rotate it around, zoom in and zoom out to get a better look or different angle at what's going on. It can get pretty wicked. LHSee also has tutorial videos, a Hunt the Higgs Boson game, explainers and more.\nWhy do we like it?\nThe LHC is a great scientific achievement\/experiment. That machine is going to find the Higgs Boson or prove that it doesn't exist, discover the origin of mass, the structure of space, time, etc, it's a very important part of human history and... I know so very little about it. This app presents the LHC's mission and various experiments in a much more digestible package. One where it's not intimidatingly boring.

{{Recently, Microsoft has been raising eyebrows by delivering mobile apps for iOS devices. There\u2019s that dead-sexy Bing app for the iPad, the slick Live Messenger app, and even OneNote for iOS. Android users haven\u2019t received the same kind of attention yet, however, but at least one Microsoft technology is headed to Google\u2019s mobile OS: Silverlight.\nThe same group who put together Moonlight \u2014 which brought Silverlight to Linux desktops \u2014 has been working feverishly to produce an Android version. Amazingly, in less than a week the Moonlight team was able to build a working version and demonstrate it at MIX11 in Las Vegas. Developer Jeffrey Stedfast says that there\u2019s plenty of work left to be done, but is clearly excited by the team\u2019s progress so far. While the demo video after the break isn\u2019t going to blow your mind, it\u2019s still very cool to see Silverlight content being played back on an Android device.\nIn addition to the initial demonstration video, Stedfast has now shared a second which shows Moonlight for Android rendering 3D transforms (it\u2019s after the break as well). It\u2019s an impressive display, especially considering the incredibly short amount of time the team has been at work on the Android port. And the way Microsoft is pushing Silverlight for Windows Phone 7, this might just become incredibly handy towards the end of the year when Mango arrives and WP7 developers can go hog wild \u2014 since you may just have a way to play with some of their creations on Android.\nFor now, you\u2019ll have to make do with watching Stedfast\u2019s demo videos, which look very smooth running on the Motorola Xoom.

Lenovo\u2019s director of new technology, Howard Locker, was quoted as saying:\n\u201cThe challenge with Windows 7 is that it\u2019s based on the same paradigm as 1985\u2014it\u2019s really an interface that\u2019s optimized for a mouse and keyboard. It has to be optimized for touch. How do you do that?\u201d\n1985 \u2013 ouch. That said, Lenovo has integrated touch into some of its PCs running Windows 7, but battery life is especially an issue with tablets, Locker also said.\nAnother interesting piece of news from a PC Magazine article on the briefing, was that the U1 Hybrid laptop, which was demoed to much buzz at CES 2010 (i.e. before the iPad came out), never got past the prototype phase.

{{SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Android smartphone operating system is a very important asset for Google Inc, but it is not critical, the company\u2019s chief executive officer said in courtroom testimony.\nThe company logo is shown at the headquarters of Oracle Corporation in Redwood City, California February 2, 2010. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\nGoogle CEO Larry Page took the stand for a second day on Wednesday in a high-stakes legal dispute with Oracle Corp over smartphone technology.\nOracle sued Google in August 2010, saying Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system infringes on its intellectual property rights to the Java programming language. Google says it does not violate Oracle\u2019s patents and that Oracle cannot copyright certain parts of Java, an \u201copen-source,\u201d or publicly available, software language.\nUnder questioning from Oracle\u2019s lawyer, Page said Android was very important, but disputed the notion that it was critical. He then said that he would not be surprised if Google\u2019s board was told that Android is critical to the company.\nThe Google co-founder, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a tie, said that the Internet search giant moved to create its own smartphone software seven years ago because the technology at the time made it difficult for consumers to use its online services on mobile phones.\n\u201cWe\u2019d been really frustrated in getting our technology out to people,\u201d Page said.\nHe said that Google would have preferred to have entered into a business partnership with Sun Microsystems, which developed Java and which Oracle acquired in 2010.\nSuch a partnership would have saved Google time in its efforts to bring its software to market, Page said, but the companies could not come to terms on an agreement. Instead, Google opted to use what he referred to as the \u201cfree part\u201d of Java.\nAsked if he could cite an example of a company besides Google that uses Java\u2019s application programming interface technologies but had not taken a license from Sun or Oracle, Page said he \u201cwas not an expert\u201d on the matter.\nThe trial before U.S. District Judge William Alsup is expected to last at least eight weeks, and will include appearances by high-profile tech executives. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison took the witness stand on Tuesday.\nEllison, 67, is a Silicon Valley veteran, while Page, 39, cuts a younger and more unpolished figure.\nEarly in the case, estimates of potential damages against Google ran as high as $6.1 billion. But the company has narrowed Oracle\u2019s claims to only two patents from seven originally, reducing the possible award. Oracle is seeking roughly $1 billion in copyright damages.\nGoogle\u2019s Android software, which the company lets handset makers use for free, has become the world\u2019s No. 1 smartphone operating system, ahead of the iOS software used on Apple Inc\u2019s popular iPhone. Google makes money when consumers access its ad-supported online services, such as Web search and email, on Android phones.\nPage also said he was not aware of Google\u2019s policies on the copying of the intellectual property of other companies. However, he said Google did nothing wrong.\n\u201cWe were very careful about what information we used and what we did not use,\u201d Page said.\nIn his testimony on Tuesday, Oracle CEO Ellison said his company had explored building its own smartphone before deciding against the idea.\nShares of Google were down 0.3 percent at $607.87 in afternoon trading, while Oracle fell 0.4 percent to $29.16.\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Oracle America, Inc v.

{{In an age where almost every mobile communication is intercepted, being privacy focused is the key to keeping some of the more private parts out of the government databank.\nA new report from Lookout claims Windows Phone owners in the UK are much more privacy focused than counterparts using Android and iOS. 41 per cent of Windows Phone users \u201calways consider their mobile privacy when using their handsets\u201d, compared to 26 per cent of both Android and iOS.\nThis is a rather large deficit on the Android and iOS side, but may be more to do with scale than anything. Age seems to be a big factor in privacy, with 18 to 24 year olds the most privacy conscious out of all age groups polled.\nOnly 4 per cent of people polled believe the UK government should be in control of mobile data privacy, compared to 9 per cent for phone networks, and 14 per cent for companies. A landslide 67 per cent of Brits think they should be in control of their data.\nIn terms of why people started defending their privacy rights, 35 per cent claimed it was due to high profile company breaches, 30 per cent said it was due to a mobile app breach, an additional 30 per cent claimed Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks kickstarted their interest in mobile privacy, and 18 per cent claim it was due to the iCloud celebrity photo leaks.\nIt is clear that most Brits are focused on privacy, but the age difference shows that young people seem to have the understanding of these GCHQ surveillance networks, while the older generation lack the understanding or interest to defend their privacy.\nConsidering the lack of demonstration against the GCHQ\u2019s mass surveillance, there is something to be said about the British public\u2019s apathy towards the huge databank of information GCHQ and the NSA are collecting on random people in the UK.\nThere have been several high profile cases to determine if the GCHQ surveillance is illegal. Some say yes, some say no, but no party running in the next General Election shows signs of stopping the surveillance network.\n}}

{{Google Gboard \u2013 one of the best keyboard apps around \u2013 is about to get a lot better on Android. The company is today adding several features that should make for a more fun and useful typing experience.\nFirst off, Gboard will now automatically suggest emoji and GIF searches in the suggestion strip as you type, which should help you get your ideas across in a more visual way. It doesn\u2019t work with every app, but it so far includes several popular ones like Facebookk Messenger, Snapchat, Hangouts, and Allo.\nWhile you could previously share GIFs, the feature was hidden under the emoji menu, which frankly made me forget it was even there \u2013 the new implementation might make me actually use it more often instead of the native GIF finder within whatever chat app I\u2019m using. For the record, the app already did so on iOS.\nThe update also adds Google Translate support, making it easier for you to communicate with your friends from other countries, as well as some UI tweaks to make voice input and searching easier. You can download the latest version of the app from the Google Play Store.\nRead next: Get a 128GB Microsoft Surface Book for free\n}}

{{Illustration: Matt Golding Credit: Murphy says he realised he had to change his habits when his five-year-old kid asked him why he was constantly looking at his phone, and last year he led the design of Android's Digital Wellbeing tools, which let users analyse their usage and set limits. Google\u2019s research shows that people aren\u2019t getting the same sense of satisfaction from their phones as they used to. They have more utility than ever before, so people want to have their phones on them at all time, but that has undesirable side effects. \"People have this super deep need to connect to each other, and I think that leads to this feeling of obligation,\" Murphy says. \"If you send your spouse or partner a message, and they take two hours to respond, you feel anxious. That kind of anxiety permeates a lot of interactions we have.\" On the other side of things people also feel the need to respond immediately, so their partner or friends don\u2019t think they\u2019re being snubbed.\nLoading \"It creates this interesting cycle of use,\" Murphy says. \"Your phone is super useful, it\u2019s a big part of your life. You always have it with you and if someone sends you a message you respond right away, and then you have your phone in your hand and what do you do next? You probably send some messages to other people. And so it perpetuates.\" The cycle\u2019s so pervasive that when people are forced to be without their phone it can make them very stressed or worried that their connection to friends or loved ones has been severed, but Murphy says becoming re-accustomed to life without constant ambient notifications is an important part of digital wellness. He recalls a Google study involving a rural community in Japan that only had basic non-smart mobile phones. \"They were some of the happiest user study participants we\u2019ve ever seen,\" he says. \"They were living a life that would be hard to live for most of us. They were more disconnected, but they really enjoyed that disconnection. We\u2019ve been thinking hard about how we can bring that to people. Creating a space for people to be OK taking longer to respond is one of the most impactful things we can do.\" Glen Murphy gives a talk on Digital Wellness at a Google event in Sydney on Tuesday morning.\nCreating a space for people to be OK taking longer to respond is one of the most impactful things we can do. Glen Murphy, global design director, Android Besides the problem with messaging, one of main issues the Digital Wellness software sought to address was compulsive consumption via smartphones. Google developed three principles help people \"feel like they are in control, rather than just dealing with stuff coming in all the time\", Murphy says. The first is provide awareness. \"What we found was that people didn\u2019t know how they were using their phone,\" Murphy says. \"Everyone is surprised at the number of unlocks they have every day.\" Even the internal Android team, when testing the feature, initially assumed it was broken and filed bug reports that the unlock number was somehow too high. This informed the second principle, which is to give people control. The dashboard lets you set daily timers for specific apps, while the ability to manage notifications in Android is now a lot more granular. The third principle is to design responsibly. Murphy says many products measure time of use as a key metric, so are judged as successful if they can get users to stare at it for as long as possible, but this no longer makes sense. He believes user satisfaction is a better metric.\n\"Time of use made sense when we were all fighting for user attention. People had limited batteries and we were fighting for the difference between five minutes and 10 minutes of use per day,\" he says. But now that people are using their phones for many hours every day, the old thinking doesn\u2019t apply. \"We see that reflected in stats, where the longer someone spends using any single thing, the less happy they are with it. The industry as a whole has to recognise that. Loading \"It\u2019s about being happy with what you did in retrospect. If you spent all weekend scrolling through different social media feeds, and then on Monday you\u2019re like \u2018that was a good use of my time, I learnt a lot\u2019, then it\u2019s great. But if you sort of sat back and had that \u2018too much chocolate cake\u2019 style moment, like \u2018argh, I shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2019; it\u2019s about giving you that awareness.\" Asked about specific changes that could be coming with the next version of Android to further address all this, Murphy said that generally he\u2019d hope to see \u201cmore seamlessness and less interuptiveness\u201d.\n}}

Blings\u2122 are the world\u2019s first illuminated shoes that will interact with an iPhone or Android device. The idea was to bring together the elements of style, functionality and technology into a coherent product that can be worn anywhere, which will stand out in a crowd.\nTo communicate with the Blings, simply pair them with an iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth, then download and install the free App and they\u2019re ready to go.\nOnce the App has been launched, it will give you several options on how to control the Blings. Press the \u201cON\u201d button to turn all the lights on. Press the \u201cPreset\u201d button to cycle through the programmed sequences. Press the \u201cMusic\u201d button and the Blings will react to audio or your step.\nHowever, one of the coolest features is when you receive a call, the blue lights will flash continuously until you pick up or the phone stops ringing; and when you get a text message, the blue light will flash the word \u201cTEXT\u201d in Morse code three times.\nBlings are equipped with blue LEDs in the heel and orange EL (Electroluminescent) lighting along the sides.\n\u201cEver since I first saw \u2018TRON\u2019 as a child, I\u2019ve been fascinated by the computers, technology and fashion in that movie,\u201d said Victor Wong, CEO, Blings. \u201cI am glad to have the opportunity to merge high-tech and fashion into something new and cool.\u201d\nBlings are made from the highest quality materials including an all leather upper section. The EL lighting is extremely flexible and waterproof. The LED lights are embedded into the sole of the shoe, making Blings very durable and capable of being worn daily.\nA push button switch on the brain in the tongue of the shoe allows the user to select various functions and presets for the Blings so they can be used without a smart phone.\nBlings will be offered in all standard sizes for both men and women as well as in white and black colors.\n[ Stale\/invalid URL removed ]\nNews issued by: Blings, Inc.\n# # #\nOriginal Story ID: 2012-10-1015-002 (8251) :: Blings-Indiegogo-Crowd-Funding-Project-Lights-Up-iPhone-and-Android-Interactive-Sneakers_2012-10-1015-002\nOriginal Keywords: Blings, Inc.

{{Twitter has just posted an update to its blog detailing new security updates rolling out via iOS and Android mobile app updates today, which include the ability to use login verification and approve login requests direct from your mobile device. Twitter announced SMS-based login verification (a form of two-factor authentication) in May, but now you don\u2019t need to supply a phone number as push notifications and app alerts can do everything you need.\nThis means that countries that were previously left out of the SMS verification program due to geographic limits can now step up to two-factor, which means everyone with an active connection and access to the official Twitter app on Android or iOS can participate. When a login is attempted and the option is enabled by a user, they\u2019ll get a push notification alerting them to the login attempt and asking them to approve it. To prevent being locked out, you also get a backup code in the application for you to record elsewhere in case your phone is permanently offline.\nThe app also provides more context around the request, giving you the type of browser it was made from and a general location request, so it\u2019s easier to know what\u2019s legit and what isn\u2019t. Chances are you won\u2019t be asked to grant legitimate access from Nairobi if you\u2019re in the U.S., for example, or vice versa. Twitter faced a number of high-profile phishing attacks earlier this year, including one of the official Associated Press account that had considerable financial impact.\nAnyone who wants to enable the verification can go to the \u201cMe\u201d tab, access Settings and then Security, then turn on the Login verification option.\nOther new features include improved search via social context indicators that provide more info on people who come up in your search suggestions, as well as a photo gallery in search which displays returned results in a mosaic layout giving you more access to more images at once.\nThe updates in general resonate with Twitter\u2019s progress of bringing more desktop features to its mobile platforms, and should go a long way to helping its users secure themselves against phishing and other types of malicious attacks.\n}}

{{There is a continuing battle in the smartphone market for who gets the top place and none more so than in the United States, and a recent survey appears to show that only two platforms are increasing in US market share and those to are of course Apple\u2019s iPhone and Android smartphones. BlackBerry, which used to be one of the major contenders, seems to be faltering somewhat though.\nSmartphones continue to grow in popularity in the US and according to a May survey by Neilson of mobile consumers in the United States, 38% of those surveyed now own a smartphone while 55% brought a smartphone in the last three months rather than a feature phone.\nCurrently leading the market share war in the US is the Android platform with 38% of smartphone users owning some kind of Android handset. However according to the report in the past several months Apple\u2019s iPhone has shown the most growth and hit 27% while Research In Motion\u2019s BlackBerry smartphones saw a drop to 21%.\nAs for the other smartphone platforms, Microsoft\u2019s\u2019 Windows Phone garnered 9% market share, Symbian and webOS have 2% each, while Palm, Windows Phone 7 and other platforms only command 1% of the US market.\nHowever in the US, feature phones still command a huge portion of the mobile market with 62% while smartphones have 38%, so the feature phone still outweighs the smartphone for now.\nObviously Android holds on to the lead in market share in the US through the vast array of differing smartphone the Android platform uses, while it has to be said that Apple does have just one smartphone to their credit albeit still having the earlier iOS handsets.\nThe market share battle between the iPhone and Android will always be there, BlackBerry used to be a contender as many people loved BlackBerry but in recent months BlackBerry seems to have lost its appeal with the masses as Android grabs most of the attention.\nHowever no doubt as Apple is expected to release the iPhone 5 at some point in the not too distant future, the word doing the rounds is September, although unconfirmed, Apple\u2019s market share should see quite a boost as the vast base of iOS faithful rush to grab the latest iOS smartphone to hit the streets.\nMarket share probably doesn\u2019t mean a great deal to the everyday smartphone user, as it doesn\u2019t affect them in any way, but big companies such as Apple, Google, and BlackBerry and others all want to be at the top of that market share pile.\n}}

{{BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has finally given into consumer clamoring for a version of its signature phone with a physical keyboard running Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google brand's Android operating system, but it may have made a mistake that dooms the product even before its November 6 launch.\nThe company, which has seen its market share drop to 0.3% globally as of the second quarter of 2015, according to IDC, has started taking pre-orders for the PRIV, its first phone running Android rather than its own proprietary operating system. That move should, in theory, make it attractive to former customers of the company because it would give them access to the Google Play app store.\nA major reason people have left BlackBerry is the fact that its declining market share made it make little sense for developers to create apps for the company's OS. By running Android, but also offering a keyboard and the security features that previously made the company popular with enterprise users, Blackberry might win back some market share.\nIt's anything but a sure thing, but the struggling brand did have nearly 5% of the market as recently as the second quarter of 2012, according to IDC.\nAn Android phone is a good idea, and I'm part of the BlackBerry diaspora willing to at least consider coming back as I've missed having a phone with a well-designed physical keyboard. The only problem is that the PRIV will cost $699.\nWhat is the PRIV?\nAs you can see in the image above, the PRIV offers a new take on the classic BlackBerry design. It has a familiar-looking keyboard, but it slides out rather than always being exposed, like many of the brand's original models.\nIt has a 5.4-inch dual-curved screen, a 3410 mAh battery with battery life of up to 22.5 hours, according to the company, 32GB of flash memory, a hot-swappable MicroSD slot (up to 2TB), and an 18 MP dual-flash Schneider-Kreuznach certified camera.\nHaving only seen pictures and not having held one, it appears to be a pretty snazzy phone that, at the right price, might win an audience.\nIs $699 too much?\nAt launch, PRIV will only be sold directly by BlackBerry. It had been reported that AT&T (NYSE:T) would be carrying the phone, but as of October 28, it was not taking pre-orders for it, and a search for the phone on the AT&T website returned no relevant results. The new handset will work on the AT&T and the T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) networks, but neither company -- at least for now -- appears to be selling it.\nThat's important because it means users won't be able to easily finance the $699 cost of the phone. On a two-year finance deal, the cost of PRIV would not seem that different from that of iPhone ($29.12 a month for the BlackBerry versus $27.04 for an iPhone), but having to shell out the full price upfront is likely a deal-breaker for many.\nIn addition, if BlackBerry had made a deal with T-Mobile, a person on that company's Jump! On Demand program could order the phone, pay for it in installments, and trade it in with no penalty if he or she did not like it. By launching with no partners and pricing its phone at the the top of the market, Blackberry has turned mission improbable into mission impossible (and that only works if you're Tom Cruise).\nReally, it's just too much money\nHad BlackBerry priced the phone a lot lower, I may have taken a chance on it, but I will most certainly not at $699. The Verge's Vlad Savov agreed with me in his piece \"BlackBerry's $699 Android gambit is too much too late,\" saying that even though the price is not crazy in a broad sense, it makes no sense for the company at this time:\nThe average selling price of a BlackBerry smartphone today is $240, so whatever handset business it still has is most definitely not in the premium segment. Perhaps half a decade ago, when everyone had to have two devices -- a BlackBerry for work and an iPhone for leisure -- this might have been an appealing proposition where the two converge into one. But that opportunity has already been captured by Apple, whose average selling price for the iPhone is well in excess of $600.\nLike most of the company's handset moves over the last five years, PRIV is an idea that might have worked, but it's not one that will work now. Sadly, when PRIV fails and the price falls, as it has on so many other unsuccessful phones, it may find an audience.\nIt's too bad for fans of BlackBerry's keyboard phones that the company did not recognize where its price point should be sooner.\n}}

{{Finally. The day has arrived: Google have unleashed Android 4.3 to the world, keeping the \"Jelly Bean\" codename intact. What exactly does Android 4.3 bring to the tablet versus Android 4.2?\nWell, we have a bunch of multi-user settings, which includes the ability to restrict profiles for younger people. This is a great feature to keep your content, or the ability to access adult content, from children. You can restrict app content at the user level, with a user enjoying the ability of restricting a number of puzzles within a game to a specific profile.\nOn top of this, you can prevent kids from going crazy and racking up huge bills with the in-app purchases. This is a must-have for all parents, in my opinion. Apple, where are you?\nWe also have Bluetooth Smart, otherwise known as Bluetooth Low Energy, included in Android 4.3. OpenGL ES 3.0 support is now here, with Hugo Barra saying that it's \"a big deal for game developers.\" What will OpenGL ES 3.0 provide us? Lens flares, reflections, and much higher quality shadows than we've ever seen before on Android.\nWhen can you get your grubby hands on Google's latest iteration of their awesome mobile OS? Well, right now it is rolling out to Nexus 4, Nexus 10, Galaxy Nexus and the first-gen Nexus 7 (now that there's a refreshed version out). The HTC One and Galaxy S4 Google Editions can expect it \"very soon.\"\n}}

{{Today, Microsoft announced that it\u2019s bundling together all of its game development platforms into one initiative called Game Stack. The idea behind Microsoft Game Stack is to give developers the tools they need to make their games all in one place, whether it\u2019s Azure for cloud services, PlayFab for matchmaking and parties, or Xbox Live for community and identity. Game Stack is a significant move in itself, and it has big implications for Xbox Live in particular, which is heading to iOS and Android as part of this initiative.\nWhile Xbox Live\u2019s arrival on iOS and Android is a big deal, this isn\u2019t a very surprising announcement. Slowly but surely, Xbox Live has started making its way to other platforms, most notably Windows PCs. There are already a handful games that feature Xbox Live achievements as well, so this is a move that Microsoft has at least been considering for some time.\nNow, with the launch of Microsoft Game Stack, developers will be able to implement things like Xbox Live logins and social services in their mobile games. It sounds like developers will even be able to implement achievements and gamerscore as well, so if you\u2019re obsessed with hunting down achievements, this could be good news indeed.\nJust last month, it was reported that Xbox Live could be heading to Nintendo Switch, but speaking to The Verge today, Microsoft cloud gaming lead Kareem Choudhry couldn\u2019t confirm that was the case. Choudhry, who also penned a breakdown of Game Stack and all that\u2019s included, did say that Microsoft\u2019s eventual goal is to unite the world\u2019s 2 billion gamers, and suggested that the company would bring Xbox Live to platforms like the Switch and PlayStation 4 if Nintendo and Sony allow it.\nIf there\u2019s an overarching theme to Microsoft\u2019s gaming ambitions, it\u2019s definitely been uniting gamers regardless of platform. Microsoft has been chipping away at platform-agnostic game streaming through Project xCloud, which was demoed a couple of days ago. Microsoft Game Stack certainly seems like it\u2019s a precursor to widespread game streaming, as it seems to feature all the tools developers need to create cloud-ready games.\nBeyond Xbox Live, Azure, and PlayFab (which is now part of Azure), other platforms included in Microsoft Game Stack include DirectX, Visual Studio, the Havok engine, and Mixer. We\u2019ll see what happens from here, but now that Game Stack is out in the open, it won\u2019t be long before we begin seeing Xbox Live in more places than just Xbox One and Windows 10.\n}}

{{Google is on the verge of revealing an Android based mobile payments service.\nPeople familiar with the matter have told The Wall Street Journal that the company is planning to unveil a near-field communications based mobile payments system at an event in New York on Thursday.\nNFC enabled smartphones and services allow users to make small payments from their phones by swiping the device in front of it.

This means more Android users can get accustomed to the same keyboard; it really should have been on the Play store from the very start.\nAt the same time, by offering its app to even more users, Google will be able to learn more about how users actually use its keyboard. This could potentially lead to faster improvements and more features for Android users everywhere, if they want it. Again, this is an optional app, and can be replaced with any other Android keyboard app.\nWe\u2019ll be watching closely to see if the app gains some new features. If it does, Android users, not just Nexus users, will have reason to celebrate.\nTop Image Credit: Jakub Krechowicz\nRead next: MLG and Twitch move away from partner CBSi, taking ad sales back in-house to capitalize on quick growth\n}}

{{Samsung Galaxy S II owners on O2 UK can get a taste of delicious Ice Cream Sandwich today, with the carrier confirming that Android 4.0 for the smartphone has been released. The much-anticipated update follows Samsung\u2019s release of the generic ICS ROM earlier this month; at the time, the Korean company warned that carrier versions might take longer to arrive.\nAlthough Ice Cream Sandwich is much changed under the hood in comparison to Android 2.3 Gingerbread as the Galaxy S II launched with, Samsung\u2019s unstoppable need to fiddle and tinker means the outward differences are less obvious. TouchWiz makes an appearance again, covering up the slick native Android 4.0 UI that we so liked on the Galaxy Nexus.\nOf course, those who particularly want unskinned Ice Cream Sandwich have probably already been using it thanks to various third-party ROMs for the smartphone. The handset gained favor for its powerful dual-core Exynos processor as well as its sizable Super AMOLED Plus display and suitability for overclocking, and went on to set sales records for Samsung.\nYou\u2019ll need Samsung\u2019s KIES app in order to install the update, which is being delivered as a PC-based download rather than OTA. Let us know how you get on with the new OS version in the comments!\n}}

{{Many of us in the west have never seen the Android-based MIUI mobile device interface that Xiaomi began developing back in 2010. Xiaomi devices have been kept out of the U.S. market by the tight control that carriers like AT&T and Verizon exert.\nBut that might not be the case forever.\nThe company gave a feature update on the MIUI interface today at a press event in San Francisco.\nXiaomi global VP of operations Hugo Barra (ex-Googler) described a number of small and large innovations in both the features and functionality of the firmware, and in the aesthetics of the interface.\nIn the photographs app, for example, MIUI makes sure all the people in a shot are looking at the camera before the shutter clicks. Then it applies a \u201cface beautification\u201d process to the image to make the people in the photo look better (this feature is turned on by default \u2014 Xiaomi wants you to be beautiful).\nMIUI now features a new guest mode, a browser \u201cnight mode\u201d that\u2019s easier on the eyes in the dark, an app-blocking mode for when guests are using the device, a home screen with an easy way to put a single icon on multiple screens, and various new 3D animations.\nThe firmware offers a cool IVR feature that shows you a full menu of products when you call a retailer. For example, Barra showed a screen populated with McDonald\u2019s menu items when the McDonald\u2019s phone number was called.\nThere\u2019s a feature called Cleaner that knows what every file on your phone is for, and can delete the ones that aren\u2019t needed to free up memory.\nXiaomi operates a MIUI app store in China, which offers things like games and animated home screen images.\nMany of the upgrades Barra discussed were about design. For instance, in the weather app the animation shows rain falling straight down in the background. When the phone is turned to the side, the image shifts so that the rain continues to fall straight down toward the earth in real life.\nBarra was once the head of the Android platform at Google, but left to join Xiaomi in 2013.\n}}

{{Tablet PCs appear to be quite a popular subject on the Internet at the moment, what with all the news coming in about the Apple iPad 2, the Motorola Xoom and the LG Slate. Another tablet PC that has recently been mentioned online is the eLocity A10.\nAccording to a recent article by Edwin Kee over on the ubergizmo.com website, the eLocity A10 \u2014 which will come with Android 2.2 Froyo installed \u2014 will be available to pre-order as from February 15th, from online retailers such as Amazon, TigerDirect, JR.com and BHPhoto.\nThe A10 comes with a starting price of $399, which according to Shane McGlaun from slashgear.com is for the 4GB unit.

{{Pinterest is ramping up its business development with new ad units, and also with some key partnerships with third parties. Today the company is announcing a deal with Telefonica, the mobile carrier giant with some 316 million customers, to preload a widget on new handsets that it sells in Latin America and Europe, starting first with its O2 UK subsidiary.\nFor now, the widget is exclusive to Telefonica. Commercial terms have not been disclosed.\nThe company says that part of the reason for pursuing a deal with Telefonica is because it\u2019s already scoring very well with its customer base. Since January, monthly active users in areas where Telefonica is active have gone up by over 130%, the company says.\n\u201cInterests are global, which is why we want Pinterest to be available wherever people want to find ideas for the everyday projects in their lives and get inspired for the future,\u201d said Don Faul, Head of Operations, Pinterest, in a statement. \u201cTelef\u00f3nica is one of the world\u2019s most advanced communications companies, and together we can provide a one-of-a-kind mobile experience to new and existing pinners around the globe.\u201d\nFor Pinterest, it\u2019s not a move to a \u201cPinterest Phone\u201d but when you consider how large the widget is when it is active (see picture above), it is evidence of how Pinterest is looking for a way to rise above the throng of apps that consumers install on their devices and then rarely use regularly, and making more of an effort to beef up its presence on the screen that is most present in people\u2019s lives.\nFor Telefonica, it gives the carrier one more way to help differentiate itself from other carriers \u2014 the widget deal is exclusive to it for a period of time \u2014 and to potentially net in a couple of key demographics where Pinterest is strong: females both younger and older.\nWith companies like Apple, Google and others creating integrated experiences based around smartphone platforms that offer their own app storefronts and billing, carriers like Telefonica have been relegated to secondary players when it comes to mobile services beyond basic voice and data.\nMany of carriers\u2019 efforts to turn that around have not fared well. For example, witness Telefonica recently axing its Tu Me app, meant to compete against the likes of WhatsApp. It will be interesting to see whether the Telefonica deal with Pinterest picks up traction, and whether the the carrier uses that to build out more by adding marketing, billing and other mobile services over time.\nIndeed, you might even read that kind of implication into Telefonica\u2019s statement on the deal (bolding mine):\n\u201cTo be the first partner for Pinterest is a huge opportunity and a great testament to Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s reach, as well as Pinterest\u2019s global ambitions,\u201d Wayne Thorsen, VP of Global Partnerships, Telef\u00f3nica Digital. \u201cOur agreement is the foundation of a deeper relationship. As the Pinterest service explodes in popularity, we are now in a position to bring the best possible mobile Pinterest experience to our Android customers around the world.\u201d\nBuilt by Pinterest, the widget will provide access to the image-based social network directly from the home screen, giving users one-tap access to popular pins, as well as a personalised feed when logged in \u2014 personal both for a user\u2019s account, and for the location she\/he is in at that moment. The widget will come preinstalled as well as part of a new version of the app in Google Play.\nWith its social graph and content largely built around images instead of words, Pinterest has an opportunity to pick up international users quickly without some of the same barriers for interaction across the wider network than you may get in other one-to-many social networks like Twitter. The latter has been working on an instant translation service powered by Bing to try to bridge that gap.\nThis is one of several moves that Pinterest has made in the last year to ramp up its presence outside of the U.S. after opening dedicated sites in countries like the UK and France.\nLink to Pinterest\u2019s blog post here.\n}}

{{This guide will explain how to easily install Android 7.0 Nougat right now for those still waiting on an update. After the beta kicked off in March and five updates were released, Google officially released Android N for Nexus devices in late August. Here\u2019s how to install it yourself, and all the most up-to-date download files.\nAs of right now most users should have already received the over the air update to Android 7.0 Nougat, but if not we can still install it. One quick way is to sign up for the beta program which is auto-updating to the official release. We got it on the Pixel C and Nexus 6P that way, and manually updated the Nexus 9. However, Google also released the factory images which we\u2019ll be using below.\nRead: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop: What\u2019s New\nThe best method is to download the Android 7.0 Nougat System Factory Image which contains all the files needed to install a stock version of Android N on the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel C, Nexus Player, and select Android One devices. Sadly the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 are no longer supported. Read on for the quick instructions.\nThose who\u2019ve already signed up for the beta can expect an over the air update notification to arrive any moment now, which is the easiest way. The first devices to see Android 7.0 were in the beta program, most notably the Nexus 6P. That said, the factory images allow for anyone and everyone with a compatible Nexus to install it right now.\nA factory image is essentially everything that you would download as an OTA update for regular Android updates, and is the complete update.\nWhat\u2019s New\nIn Android 7.0 Nougat Google has made a lot of changes on the surface, and behind the scenes. Meaning owners will notice lots of improvements, but many won\u2019t be visual. Some noteworthy new features are native multi-window support for tablets and smartphones for improved multi-tasking, recent app switching, direct reply to notifications right from the pulldown bar, bundled notifications for a cleaner look, seamless updates, Android instant apps and significant improvements to Android Doze, which saves battery life. Doze puts Android into a deep-sleep low-power mode to save battery, and with Android N this will happen whenever the screen is turned off, not just when untouched for extended periods.\nThis guide will show you how to install the just released Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat update right now, instead of waiting. This is something you can do from Windows, Mac, Linux or ChromeOS. There are multiple ways this can be done, and lots of things that can go wrong, but below are the easiest steps without spending hours setting up all of Google\u2019s developer software. Lets get started. First you\u2019ll need ADB, some files, factory images and then you\u2019ll be running Nougat in a matter of minute.\nHow to Install ADB on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu & ChromeOS\nBefore you can install the Android 7.0 to the Nexus 5x, Nexus 6p, or others you will need to install ADB and Fastboot to your computer. This is a program that runs on your PC\/Mac to connect to your Android device through a USB cable and flash Android software to a device.\nInstalling ADB and Fastboot is one of the most annoying parts of installing Android factory images, but several tools make it incredibly easy.\nHow to Install ADB on Windows\nIf you are using a Windows machine you can use the 15 second adb installer to streamline the process and get up and running in a few minutes.\nDownload the ADB installer for Windows. Find the file, right-click on it and choose Run as Administrator. When prompted you need to give the app access to run as an administrator. After the app launches type a Y and enter to select yes to Install ADB & Fastboot, to intsll ADB\/Fastboot systemwide and to install Drivers. When a new window pops up follow the steps to install the drivers.\nAfter this is installed you should be ready to install the Android 7.0 Nougat release to a Nexus smartphone, tablet or player.\nHow to Install ADB on Mac, Linux & ChromeOS\nNexus Tools makes it easy to install ADB on a Mac, Linux or even ChromeOS. Simply open Terminal on the computer and past in the code from xda. Open terminal by going to search, and just typing Terminal to open it. Then copy\/paste and we\u2019re nearly there.\nThis will install ADB and Fastboot on Mac, Linux and Chrome OS without the need to do anything else. It\u2019s extremely easy, and avoids all the ADB package mess that typically takes much longer to complete.\nAfter the script finishes type ADB or Fastboot to start running either process. This is where you\u2019ll need to be to flash the new official Android 7.0 system images provided by Google onto your device. Remember to head into settings > developer options and enable USB Debugging first.\nHow to Install Android 7.0 Nougat Right Now\nThe first thing you need to do is download the just released Android 7.0 Nougat System Image for your device, which have been pasted in the links below for your convenience. You\u2019ll have to agree to the terms to proceed. Now that we\u2019re no longer on the beta these are the actual factory images from a new page, rather than the developer preview site. Click the links below to download the Android 7.0 image.\nSo far Google has released the image for almost all supported devices, but for whatever reason the original Nexus 6 is still missing. All the links below are the latest releases, except for the Motorola Nexus 6. Check back later for an updated download link.\nNext you will need to unzip these files to a folder you can access, we just unzipped it to our Mac desktop. After you have the Android 7.0 Nougat system image unzipped you will need to find this folder and type cmd into the address bar on Windows, or open terminal and direct the folder to this new folder on Mac, Linux or Chrome OS. Reminder, if you\u2019re on a MAC you need to make sure terminal is running inside the folder you just unzipped.\nIf your Nexus is not bootloader unlocked you should do that first. We could not install the Android 7.0 N System image and update with the device locked. This will wipe your device and erase all user data, settings, pictures, etc. Repeat, this will erase everything!\nOpen a Terminal in the adb folder and type the command below then hit enter.\nadb reboot bootloader\nIn Fastboot type:\nfastboot oem unlock\nThen hit enter. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose to erase the device. Wait a minute or so for it to unlock. This removes everything on your device.\nNexus 6P users will need to use \u201cfastboot devices\u201d and then \u201cfastboot flashing unlock\u201d to unlock the bootloader. Then proceed.\nFlash the Image\nNow open the folder containing the unzipped Android 7.0 System Image file you just downloaded. Type cmd in the address bar. Type the multiple commands posted below and hit enter, or copy\/paste to avoid mistakes. On a Mac you can open Terminal in the folder by enabling terminal shortcuts in settings. This is key for Mac users. Head to System Preferences and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find \u201cNew Terminal at Folder\u201d in the settings and click the box. Now when you\u2019re in Finder, just right-click a folder and you\u2019re shown the open to open Terminal. Or just do it from the desktop where you unzipped the Factory image as shown below.\nOnce in terminal simply copy and paste the commands below to install Android N to your Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, or even the Nexus Player.\nThis will flash all of the needed files. If you are on a Mac or other computer you will need to type;\nsudo .\/\nThis will push all of the files and update your device to the latest official release of Android 7.0 Nougat right from Google. The same one that is coming as an over-the-air update. The files will start pushing and installing and your Nexus device may reboot. Take a look at the new updating animation, and wait for the process to complete. The logo screen may stay for a long time. Don\u2019t unplug the device. This may last 10 minutes or longer. When Android prompts you to complete setup you can unplug the Nexus. It took less than two minutes for us.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some users may experience a \u201cmissing system.img\u201d error and the installation will be aborted. This is because the way you\u2019re trying to flash the update. Instructions on how to get around this can be found right here. Essentially users will need to unzip the update.zip folder and move all the images to the original folder we mentioned above, then manually flash them one by one, vs the flash-all command we\u2019re using here. Only do this if you run into issues with missing images. It takes a few more steps, but works all the same.\nWhen the process finishes you can enter your information or Gmail account and start using Android 7.0 right now on your Nexus devices. As soon as the rest of the factory images are posted we will add the download links.\nAndroid 7.0 Nougat Over-the-Air Update\nFor those who\u2019d rather not toy around with all this stuff, we have good news. For one, Android 7.0 Nougat was released on August 22nd, and at this point most or all devices should have received the update. That means no messing with the scary stuff above, and accepting an over the air update like any other previous update. Google will even be using the beta program to push maintenance releases (MR1, MR2, etc) this fall.\nAs of right now we\u2019ve received the over the air update for our Nexus 6P and Pixel C tablet, but I had to manually flash Android 7.0 on the Nexus 9 using the steps above.

{{It\u2019s been just eight weeks since Zimride\u2019s ride-sharing service, Lyft, was launched in beta, providing San Francisco users a low-cost alternative to cabs and Ubers. Since then, the service has grown a tremendous amount: It\u2019s got more than 100 drivers operating in the area, who together are taking hundreds of riders a day.\nLyft works like other car transportation apps: You open it up and the app searches for available cars nearby. Difference is, those cars are driven by regular folks, not your usual surly taxi driver or buttoned up Uber driver. Users can rate their drivers, and at the end of the ride, there\u2019s a suggested donation, which is typically about 80 percent of your average taxi fare. Drivers also rate their passengers \u2014 more on that later.\nZimride founder John Zimmer said at an event for press on Thursday that Lyft was launched to make local transportation \u201cmore affordable, more social, and more efficient,\u201d by connecting regular drivers with riders through mobile apps. The company thinks of the service as \u201cyour friend with a car on demand,\u201d and tries to differentiate itself with a culture of friendliness. Riders are encouraged to sit up front with the driver, there\u2019s an obligatory fist bump when you first hop in, and riders can usually charge up their iPhones or pick the music in the car. You know, kind of like riding with an actual friend.\nTo date, the service has operated in more of a friends-and-family mode in San Francisco, with an iPhone app in beta. It\u2019s seen a very positive response from its initial group of users: About 80 percent of riders who have gotten a ride use the app again. And 55 percent of users request a ride weekly.\nCount me among them: I don\u2019t have a car and usually bike around town, but for times when I need to go to a part of town that isn\u2019t easy to get to \u2014 damn you hills between me and the Marina \u2014 or when riding with a group of friends who also don\u2019t have cars, Lyft has become sort-of a go-to way to get around. I\u2019m also not the only fan of the service at TechCrunch \u2014 Josh, Alexia, and Kim are also regular users among others.\nFrankly, I\u2019ve never had a bad experience with a Lyft, but because the drivers aren\u2019t licensed, the service operates in a bit of a legal gray area \u2014 and some would argue that the service isn\u2019t legal at all. It circumvents that with the \u201cdonation\u201d bit, but there\u2019s kind of an understanding that if you don\u2019t give a donation you\u2019ll be rated poorly and maybe you\u2019ll have a hard time getting rides in the future.\nLyft also has an intensive process for evaluating drivers, which includes DMV and criminal background checks, followed by in-person interviews and vehicle inspections. Finally, there\u2019s a two-hour training session for drivers that make it through all that, to help get them familiar with the service and the culture. About 5 percent of all applicants end up getting chosen.\nGetting drivers trained and on-boarded will become increasingly important as Lyft opens up its business to the general public to all of San Francisco. On Tuesday, it\u2019s publicly launching and also introducing an Android app to complement its existing iPhone app. That will open the service up to a whole group of new users that otherwise weren\u2019t able to try it out.\nFrom a fleet perspective, that will mean nearly doubling its number of drivers in a pretty short period of time. Lyft has a little more than 100 drivers today, with another 40 on deck, just waiting to go through driver training. But it plans to expand to about 200 to handle San Francisco alone.\nWhile Lyft is being operated as a separate service, it\u2019s still under the umbrella of Zimride, a service that launched mostly for longer shared rides. Zimride has raised more than $7 million, from investors such as Mayfield Fund, Floodgate, Keith Rabois, K9 Ventures, and fbFund.\n}}

{{Supercell, the highly-regarded Finnish mobile games startup, revealed last month that it is weighing up the prospect of developing Android apps for the first time as it seeks to find success in Asia.\nIlkka Paananen, CEO of the \u2018Clash of Clans\u2019 developer, told the FT that the company is \u201cvery actively thinking\u201d about the Google platform:\nYou can\u2019t be global without being in Asia, and you can\u2019t be big in Asia without being on Android. I guess that\u2019s a long way of saying that we are very actively thinking about it.\nPaananen\u2019s disclosure that being on Android is a must is interesting since it comes at a time of great debate between the merits of iOS and Android for developers and users.\nSupercell is one company that you might think could remain iOS-only, since it is already practically printing money from the Apple platform alone. Indeed, it was bringing in $2.4 million a day from its apps back in April, when it was valued at $770 million.\nMarket share across Asia\nIn the US, it\u2019s largely accepted that iOS is still the primary platform, as TechCrunch notes. Market share between the two is fairly even in the US and, as reports from the like of Opera show, iOS is the better \u2018quality\u2019 user base \u2014 which, in developer terms, means higher average spend per user.\nThat concept is different in Asia, where the number of Android devices far outweigh iOS numbers in many countries.\nOver 90 percent of smartphones sold in China are Android-based, while some form of the Google operating system is said to be installed on over half of the smartphones that exist in the country \u2014 though many of those Android installations are \u2018forked\u2019 local variants.\nAndroid also dominates mobile Web usage in Korea \u2014 Samsung\u2019s homeland \u2014 while Android devices make up 70 percent of shipments in Southeast Asia, according to reports.\nJapan is perhaps a notable exception \u2014 since the iPhone is the top seller \u2014 although the country\u2019s biggest operator Docomo is still to offer the device, despite recent speculation indicating an Apple partnership is on the cards.\nIn general, as Paananen says, Android is key to finding scale in Asia.\nAndroid tipping the scales\nCountless reports \u2014 including data from Opera \u2014 suggest that iOS remains the higher yielding platform, per user, but the sheer gap in user numbers between the two platforms is tipping the scale in favor of Android in many markets across Asia.\nAll of this underpins Paananen\u2019s comments, but, actually, it goes further than that: many Asia-based startups are prioritizing Android over iOS.\nWhile few have gone so far as to develop Android-only apps \u2014 in the same way that many developers go iOS-only \u2014 it is notable that they are pushing important updates to Android first, and generally putting the Google platform first.\nThat\u2019s quite something when you consider that, in the US, some companies ignore Android altogether. For example, Nike has no plans to make an Android app for its popular Fuelband product, alienating tens of millions of potential and actual customers.\nThe Asian messaging apps that go Android first\nMessaging apps are leading the way, and that\u2019s significant because they are developing into mobile content platforms that are rivaling the likes of Facebook across the region.\nLine, the Japanese\/Korean messaging service with over 230 million registered users, is one such example of the different attitude to Android in Asia.\nLine, which offers over 50 apps, consistently delivers new features and tweaks to the Android version of its flagship messaging app, ahead of its iOS counterpart. The Line app has under 50 million users in Japan, so that focus on Android helps it reach and spark interest from its growing overseas user base.\nNaturally, there are other factors at play too.\nA Line spokesperson tells TNW that app store approvals, which tend to be quicker are non-existent for Google Play, allow it to iterate quicker for Android, while monetization features like gifting and free coins are only available for Android. That\u2019s because Apple revoked the gifting feature on Line\u2019s iOS app in May due to a breach of its App Store terms and conditions.\nWeChat, the messaging service developed by billion dollar Chinese internet firm Tencent, is a similar story.\nThe service has racked up more than 400 million registered users (of whom an impressive 235 million use the app per month), and it recently made its first move towards monetization when it rolled out a gaming platform and stickers. Yet, said games were piloted and first launched on Android, before making their way to the iOS version later.\nIt isn\u2019t just the big guns, smaller startups do similar.\nCubie, a Taiwan-headquartered messaging app with over 8 million registered users, regularly pushes its updates to Android long before they find their way to iOS users.\nJames Hill, Cubie\u2019s International Messenger, tells TNW that Android not only accounts for the majority of its users, but provides greater scope for testing \u2014 that includes piloting new features with small numbers of users:\nFor product development and A\/B testing, Android allows us to experiment with features and design changes much more easily than any other platform. In terms of numbers Android is of course the larger platform, especially in rapidly growing markets in Asia, where most of our users reside. While personally I prefer iPhone, from a company perspective Android allows for much more experimentation and space to try new things. If they work out we add them to our iOS app, if not, then no harm done\niOS remains first pick for some\u2026for now\nThere are exceptions, but they tend to be services that are not focused on Asian consumers. (Though Asia\u2019s messaging apps are now starting to go global, they initially targeted and grew among Asia-based users.)\nSingapore based Burpple, a photo app for food lovers, initially launched on iOS in March 2012. It didn\u2019t release an Android version (initially in beta) until February 2013 because Singapore is an iOS hotspot \u2014 it was found to have the most Apple devices per population anywhere in the world.\nHowever, in order to grow its footprint in Southeast Asia, Android was essential, not to mention that the Google platform is fast-growing in Singapore too.\nBillPin, another Singapore-based startup, began life as an iOS-only app.\n\u201cWhen we started a year ago, our target audience was mainly in the US, so our focus was iOS. We went iOS first, Web second and Android only came six months later,\u201d co-founder Darius Cheung says, explaining that iOS accounts for 70 percent of its undisclosed users base.\n\u201cHowever, that said, when we ask our users, we get a sense that many of them are looking to switch to Android devices the next time they buy one,\u201d he adds, highlighting a change that Reuters picked up on earlier this year.\nMichael Smith, Chief Product Office at Indian video content startup Spuul and formerly with Yahoo Asia, recently penned an excellent blog post weighing up the growing reach of Android and the much publicized difficulties of catering to the operating system and the fragmentation of different versions.\nSmith notes that Android users typically \u201cpay less [and] complain more,\u201d but he admits Android has grown to a point where it can\u2019t be ignored \u2014 although Apple\u2019s much-rumored iPhone 5C could disrupt that:\nFor Spuul we have no choice but to support both iOS and Android. We also see that Android is growing like mad and in some emerging markets is bigger than iOS and continues to grow faster than iOS. I don\u2019t see this changing unless Apple comes out with a cheaper phone and I really hope they do since users with an option to purchase something from Apple probably will if the price makes it more affordable. Either way we will keep working on both and we know that with Android it will take more time, more money and more bodies to equal what we do with iOS. It is just that simple.\nBudget iPhone aside, Apple is also said to be close to finally agreeing a deal with Japan\u2019s leading operator Docomo, which counts nearly half of the country\u2019s phone-owning public as customers.\nWhile Japanese developers are generally not focused solely on Android, that Docomo partnership could have significant ramifications for Android\u2019s position in Japan, as Tokyo-based tech consult Serkan Toto tells TNW:\nYou still see a lot of games and high-quality apps coming out first and\/or exclusively for iOS, [but] Android has one big advantage: it\u2019s being pushed by all three big carriers in Japan, most importantly by Docomo \u2014 because Docomo doesn\u2019t carry the iPhone. So it is the key driver for Android\u2019s penetration and branding in Japan, and it has over 50 million subscribers, a big plus for the platform in this country.\nThe winds of change blow strongest in Asia?\nSpeaking in December 2011, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt boldly claimed Android would become the preference of developers by the summer 2012. While that didn\u2019t come true \u2014 and is still yet to \u2014 the balance of play is already shifting to Android in Asia.\nIt remains to be seen whether user numbers can tip the scale in the US and Europe in the same way they have done in Asia, while it is also unclear if significant numbers of developers in Asia will jettison iOS altogether in favor of a sole focus on Android.\nThat latter development hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it is entirely feasible that small teams on limited resources could pool their efforts towards the larger market of Android, ahead of iOS. However, for larger developers, as mentioned throughout, iOS remains the optimum platform for generating revenue while Android has the potential to yield faster growth in downloads.\nYet, despite all of this, Apple could turn the market on its head with a cheaper iPhone. That device appears to have been confirmed by China Telecom, after the operator published a now-deleted Sina Weibo message urging customers to pre-reserve the \u2018iPhone 5C\u2019, having been speculated for years.\nThe device is tipped to be unveiled next week at a September 10 event \u2014 time will tell if and how it affects Android\u2019s rise in Asia.\nImages via Thinkstock, Supercell, Line, WeChat, Thinkstock, Toshifumi Kitamura\/Getty Images and Apple\nRead next: Design that sticks: Meet the designers behind the mobile messaging sticker craze\n}}

{{Twitter\nTweeters who use the Android app should notice a few changes the next time they tap into it.\nUpdated Tuesday, the latest version of Twitter for Android offers a look similar to other Android apps that use Google's Material Design aesthetic, with larger icons and more white space.\nTwitter has been struggling to attract more tweeters at the same time its revenue and stock price have tumbled. With more people using mobile apps, simplifying its Android software is one small step Twitter can take to make the service more user-friendly.\nThe new Twitter app sports a tab bar at the top of the screen where you can swipe to bounce between your Timeline, Notifications, Direct Messages and Moments. You can swipe from the left to display a navigation menu that provides quick access to your profile, Highlights, lists, the Connect tab and settings. And you'll find a new floating button that lets you fire off a tweet from anywhere within the app.\nThe new look and layout started rolling out Tuesday, so some Twitter users may not see it just yet.\n}}

{{BlackBerry has not made any attempt to hide the fact that its mobile messaging service, BlackBerry Messenger, will be coming to Android and iOS this summer. The company has, however, been quite tight lipped on when exactly BBM will launch on both platforms. In a recent interview, India's managing director for BlackBerry accidentally let a hint slip that September could be the official launch month for BBM on Android.\n\"The service is coming to Android this summer. But summer as per North America, where it remains till September,\" said Sunil Lalvani. He did not elaborate whether or not his claim actually meant it would arrive at the end of September nor did he make any mention of a release date for iOS.\nPreviously we were led to believe that BBM would make its Android and iOS debut sometime on or around June 27 but that date has obviously come and gone. BBM on iOS and Android could play a major role in companies who have multiple smartphones all running different operating systems but need a central form of mobile messaging. Some analysts say that it could once again become the de facto messaging service for professionals on the go.\n}}

{{Toshiba has launched a new range of Excite Android tablets, spanning 7.7-inches to 13-inches and each running NVIDIA\u2019s quadcore Tegra 3 processor. The new Excite 10, Excite 13 and Excite 7.7 slates run Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and have a 5-megapixel main camera along with 2-megapixel front cameras; they also offer, in the form of the Excite 13, one of the biggest screen resolutions we\u2019ve seen so far on an Android tablet, running at 1600 x 900.\nThe Excite 10 is the mainstream model, with a 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 10-point multitouch display in a 0.35-inch thick chassis that weighs 1.32 pounds. Runtimes of up to 10hrs and standby of a full week is promised, along with 1GB of RAM; connectivity includes WiFi and Bluetooth, plus micro HDMI, a microUSB port and a full-sized SD card reader.\nIf that\u2019s not big enough for you, the Toshiba Excite 13 fits a 13.3-inch LED-backlit 16:9 display into a 0.4-inch thick, 2.2 pound casing. It has quad speakers with SRS Labs audio, an included tablet stand for when it gets too heavy for you, and the same 1GB of RAM and Tegra 3 as its smaller brethren.\nHowever, Toshiba has also been able to use the space to fit in more batteries, so you get up to 13 hours of runtime or up to seven days of standby. Ports are the same as on the Excite 10.\nFinally, the Toshiba Excite 7.7 follows in Samsung\u2019s footsteps with the Galaxy Tab 7.7, packing an AMOLED display into a compact 0.3-inch thick, 13.4 ounce slate. It has a microUSB port and microSD card slot, though no sign of a dedicated HDMI connection.\nAll three will get various custom Toshiba apps alongside the Android usual, including ebook software, a media streaming tool, and preloaded Netflix and Zinio apps. The Excite 10 will go on sale in May, priced at $449.99 for the 16GB model, $529.99 for the 32GB model, and $649.99 for the 64GB model.\nThat will be followed by the Excite 7.7 and Excite 13, both arriving at the beginning of June. The 13-incher will be $649.99 for the 32GB and $749.99 for the 64GB, while the 7.7-incher will be $499.99 for the 16GB and $579.99 for the 32GB.\n}}

{{Your choice of smartphone reveals more about you than you might care to imagine. Researchers from the Universities of Lincoln and Lancaster in the UK found that iPhone users are a bunch of unlikeable, image-obsessed liars in comparison to Android phone owners. Heather Shaw, co-author of the study, explains why people with certain personality traits are more attracted to iPhones. Why did you decide to look into the personality traits of smartphone users? Smartphones are highly customizable. We wanted to investigate what a person's choice of either an iPhone or Android phone says about the user's personality.

It is becoming apparent that smartphones are a mini version of its user. We don't like it when someone uses our smartphone because it can reveal so much about us. This provides us with important information about the relationship humans have with technology; we place part of our self-identity in the technology that we use. What research went into this study? In study one, 529 smartphone users completed an online personality test. Thirty-eight percent were Android users and 54 percent were iPhone users. We also asked them for details such as their age, genderand socio-economic status. Related Articles You can help researchers curb NYC noise pollution as a citizen scientist The Muddled History of How the Margarita Was Invented Everything you need to know about Alamo Drafthouse Brooklyn In study two, we wanted to see whether we could predict if a person owned an iPhone or an Android phone. We asked 221 participants to answer questions on their personality and demographics, and then showed them their smartphone prediction. We then asked them whether this prediction was accurate. What were the results? In study one, we found that Android users were older, displayed higher levels of honesty-humility traits, were more open, and avoided similarity more than iPhone users. Android users also had lower emotionality scores and felt that a smartphone is less of a status object. Interestingly, iPhone users were not higher in socio-economic status than Android users. In study two, we managed to predict what smartphone a person owned to an accuracy of 70 percent. Why are iPhone users more likely to be emotional and untrustworthy? IPhone and Android smartphones have different apps, technical specs, and functionalities, which might cause people who have certain personality traits to be attracted to one brand over the other. You might also buy a smartphone to become closer to your ideal self. A more controversial idea is that we embody the semantics and characteristics of the technology we own. So if you buy an iPhone, over time you start acting like typical iPhone users. Why is your study important? It might be possible to pick a technology that is more suited to you based on your personality traits and demographics. We can predict what technology a person owns or might own in future based on their personality traits and demographics. What\u2019s next? It is possible that people\u2019s downloaded apps, or their smartphone use patterns are telling of their personality or lifestyle, so this can be investigated in follow up studies. We are interested in continuing research which investigates how mobile technology and people are integrating and merging, and how this resultantly influences human behavior. -Dmitry Belyaev\n}}

{{Shockingly (note the sarcasm), Google seems hell-bent on making its Google Wallets platform the de facto standard for Android in-app payments.\nA blistering Reuters report from yesterday claimed that Google was forcing developers to adopt its payments platform, in lieu of alternatives from PayPal, Boku, and others. It\u2019s a seemingly dramatic tale, complete with an e-mail Google sent to a developer threatening to remove their app from the Android Market.\nThe only problem? When asked for comment about the report, a Google spokesperson tells us, \u201cOur policies haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\nGoogle noted that it has required app developers to adopt Google Wallet since it\u2019s been made available for Android, and it has been pursuing those who don\u2019t follow the rules for some time, in a statement to the Verge. The only exceptions are for physical item purchases (from the likes of Amazon or eBay) and transferable digital goods like e-books.\nWhile Android is known for its openness, that freedom has often come back to bite the platform. It has allowed for Android makers to add all sorts of ugly software to their devices, and opened the door for Amazon to create a device like the Kindle Fire, which is based on Android but doesn\u2019t offer every Android app.\nWhen it comes to in-app payments, having too many choices could make it more confusing and difficult for consumers to make purchases. \u201cAlthough this move by Google might seem high-handed, it reduces the friction for purchases inside Android apps and therefore makes users more valuable,\u201d Appsperse CEO Hugo Troche told Reuters.\nIndeed, Apple has been even more heavy-handed with in-app payments on iOS, which has forced major companies like Amazon to rethink how their iOS apps are structured. While annoying for developers, Apple\u2019s strategy has helped spur on the popularity of in-app payments on its platform. If Google is to effectively compete, it will have to play the same ballgame.\nBut even though Google is trying to push Wallet in Google Play (formerly the Android Market), it\u2019s also worth noting that the platform\u2019s openness allows developers to make their apps available through other app stores, or directly from their website. That\u2019s something that Apple doesn\u2019t offer at all with iOS.\nIt also makes sense for Google to track down in-app payment violators, because it has no way of enforcing what payments services they use before their apps hit Google Play. Unlike iOS, Google doesn\u2019t have a strict approval process for apps that hit its marketplace. The only way it can enforce its policies is by getting in touch with devs after the fact.\nReuters also notes that Google takes a 30 percent cut from in-app purchases \u2014 the same as iOS, but significantly more than some alternative payments services. But according to Google\u2019s documentation, that transaction fee is just 5 percent.\nI can\u2019t blame any developer who feels confused by the situation though, as Google hasn\u2019t made it fully clear that Google Wallet is the only choice for in-app payments. In the company\u2019s Android Developer Market Policies, its payment section reads as follows:\nPaid and Free Applications\nDevelopers charging for applications and downloads from Android Market must do so by using an authorized Payment Processor. Developers offering additional content, goods, or services for an application downloaded from Android Market must offer an authorized Payment Processor as the payment option.\nIt sounds like Google is referring to more than one \u201cauthorized Payment Processor,\u201d even though Google Wallet is the only option at the moment.\n}}

{{Google has released the first beta of Android Q, the next version of Android that we'll see on Pixel phones first later this year. The beta program is available for anyone who wants to help test Android Q, unlike in previous years when it was limited to only developers for the first beta.\nBefore we go any further -- we can't recommend installing Android Q on your primary phone. There will be bugs that break things and all but ruin battery life. If you don't have an old phone that's compatible with the beta program, it's a good idea to wait until later in the beta cycle before jumping in. Even Google warns users during the signup process, \"Certain functionality (including core functionality, such as your ability to place and receive calls) or applications may not work properly.\"\nBeta testing is fun, sure. But if you need your phone to work 100 percent of the time, hold off.\nNow playing: Watch this: iPhone XR vs. Pixel 3: How to choose the best phone\nWith that said, if you're interested in providing feedback and helping Google track down bugs, here's what you need to know:\nWhat devices are eligible?\nAt launch, only Google's Pixel phones are eligible. That means the original Pixel, Pixel XL ( ), Pixel 2 ( ), Pixel 2 XL ( ), Pixel 3 ( ) and Pixel 3 XL ( ).\nHow do I install it?\nScreenshot by Jason Cipriani\/CNET\nThere are two options. The easiest is to wait for the beta program website, and sign in to the Google account linked to your Pixel phone. Scroll down and find your eligible devices, then click on Opt In and accept the terms. After you enroll your device, you'll receive all Android Q beta updates over-the-air, the same way you receive software updates right now. It can take up to 24 hours before your device receives the update, so give it some time.\nThe second method involves flashing the system images after downloading them from Google. This method means you will need to unlock your device's bootloader, factory reseting it in the process, and then install the update. Also, because you flashed the first image, you won't receive future updates over-the-air. You'll need to manually flash each beta update -- which is a hassle.\nCan I leave the beta?\nYes. Regardless of how you installed the beta, you can leave at any time. For those who signed up through the beta program, you can visit the same site again and opt out. You will receive the latest official build for your device over-the-air, but it will factory-reset your phone.\nThose who flashed Android Q will need to download the latest official build and flash it via the same tools, and your device will be factory reset.\n}}

{{For too long, budget smartphones were miserable devices that promised only the bare minimum and rarely delivered a smooth user experience.\nThankfully, that's changed, and in recent years we've seen a ton of progress made in the $250 space. It's a price point cheap enough for the smartphone to be affordable, but not so cheap that the device lacks quality or innovation, if done properly. And its leaders right now are two unlikely phone makers with a century of history between them: Motorola and Nokia.\nThe $249 Moto G6 is Motorola's bread and butter \u2014 a device that speaks to the company's strength in producing well-rounded, thoughtfully designed handsets that grant you everything you need and don't waste your time with things you don't. It would have been our de facto recommendation for budget buyers, if Nokia hadn't arrived on the scene immediately afterward with the $269 Android One-powered Nokia 6.1.\nBoth devices are excellent options for those looking to save hundreds of dollars while making relatively few compromises. But which comes out on top? We compared Motorola's and Nokia's best efforts to find the answer.\nMoto G6 Nokia 6.1 Price $249\/$299 $269 OS Android 8.0 Oreo Android 8.1 Oreo Screen Size, Resolution 5.7-inch LCD (2160 x 1080) 5.5-inch LCD (1920 x 1080) CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 RAM 3GB\/4GB 3GB Storage 32GB\/64GB 32GB microSD Slot Yes, up to 256GB Yes, up to 256GB Rear Camera Dual: 12 MP (f\/1.8) and 5 MP (f\/2.2) 16 MP (f\/2.0) Front Camera 8 MP (f\/2.2) 8 MP (f\/2.0) Battery Size 3,000 mAh 3,000 mAh Battery Life (Hrs:Min) 9:25 10:24 Water Resistance No No Dimensions 6.06 x 2.85 x 0.33 inches 5.86 x 2.98 x 0.32 inches Weight 6.07 ounces 5.89 ounces\nDesign\nThe Moto G6 and Nokia 6.1 take opposing perspectives in terms of design.\nMoto G6In the case of the G6, Motorola carried over the hallmarks of today's flagships by including an 18:9 screen, smaller bezels and a curved glass back. The result is a phone that's very easy to use one handed and in some ways looks more modern than Nokia's contender.\nNokia 6.1The Nokia 6.1 does appear to be more dated at first glance, based on its 16:9 aspect ratio and all-metal build. It has sharper edges, which make it a bit more cumbersome to hold, and it weighs more. But the heft adds a level of polish and quality that feels distant in the Moto G6. And that's enhanced on the Nokia with shiny copper trim around the frame and camera stack that actually looks fantastic in person.\nOverall, the Moto G6 gets the slight edge here for its narrower footprint, which makes it more comfortable, pocketable and generally easier to live with. However, Nokia still deserves credit for crafting a very handsome handset with a more businessy, grown-up vibe.\nWinner: Moto G6\nDisplay\nYou can't go wrong with either of these screens. Both the 5.7-inch Moto G6 and 5.5-inch Nokia 6.1 have full-HD LCD displays (full HD plus in the G6's case, because of its 18:9 aspect ratio and additional vertical pixels). That means they're similarly sharp.\nMoto G6When it comes to brightness and color representation, they're pretty close, too. The Moto G6's panel tops out at 413 nits and covers 113 percent of the sRGB color space. The Nokia 6.1 is a bit more vibrant, notching a peak brightness of 450 nits and a slightly wider color gamut, at 142 percent.\nFinally, the Nokia 6.1's display proved a bit more accurate in our testing, with a Delta-E score of 0.26 compared to the Moto G6's 0.39. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) While we like the extra real estate Motorola's screen provides, Nokia's is just a hair nicer, so it takes this round.\nWinner: Nokia 6.1\nCamera\nExpectations are never high for budget phone cameras, and admittedly, neither Motorola nor Nokia has done much to buck that trend with these devices.\nNokia 6.1Motorola combines a 12-megapixel, f\/1.8 primary sensor with a 5-MP secondary one for depth effects on the G6, while Nokia opted for a single, 16-MP f\/2.0 lens on the back of the 6.1.\nMoto G6In terms of features, Motorola has the upper hand \u2014 at least on paper. That second lens allows for shallow depth-of-field portraits and selective color photos. But, like on so many other cheap dual-camera devices, the level of quality you get from these modes isn't anywhere near the bar set by top-dollar phones with a plurality of lenses, like the iPhone X and Galaxy S9+.\nOn the whole, the Moto G6 produced cooler shots than the Nokia 6.1, as evidenced in the above photo at a park along the Delaware River on a sunny day. Nokia's shooter pulled out a much more realistic scene, with more neutral white balance and less of the Moto G6\u2019s green-blue tint permeating the entirety of the frame. However, the Motorola\u2019s device exhibited better detail in the shadows and more sharpness overall.\nEven with the artistry of the Moto G6's bokeh effect, the Nokia 6.1 delivered a crisper and more balanced portrait. My colleague Jorge definitely stands out from the background better with the help of Motorola's dual-lens tricks, but the blur is applied imprecisely along the limits of the foreground. The Nokia 6.1 also painted the frame with less saturated hues, particularly in Jorge's face.\nThe Moto G6 did win some points back in low-light photography. This image of a trio of figurines is much better exposed through the G6's wider-aperture lens, with significantly less noise and color bleeding compared to the struggling Nokia 6.1. That makes the Moto G6 a better choice in less-than-ideal lighting situations, though in most other cases, you'll probably want the Nokia.\nWinner: Nokia 6.1\nPerformance\nAlthough the Moto G6 and Nokia 6.1 feature different chipsets, they're actually more alike than their spec sheets suggest.\nMotorola chose the brand-new Snapdragon 450 processor for the G6, and paired that with 3GB of RAM. The combination is actually much snappier than you'd expect, given that Qualcomm's 400-series silicon tends to appear in even lower-end models than either of the phones featured here.\nThe Nokia 6.1 has the same Snapdragon 630 system on chip you may recall from the HTC U11 Life or Moto X4 Android One. However, whereas those phones cost between $350 and $400 when they launched last fall, the Nokia 6.1 is just $269.\nMORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones\nThe kicker is that the CPU in both chipsets is almost identical. Actually, the Moto G6's Snapdragon 450 actually outperformed the 630 inside the Nokia 6.1 in Geekbench 4 by a score of 3,934 to 3,784. However, across the bulk of day-to-day usage, when opening apps and multitasking, streaming YouTube videos, browsing Google Maps and so on, you're unlikely to notice any difference in speed.\nGraphics performance is another story, though. The Snapdragon 630 employs a more powerful GPU, and so it smoked the Moto G6 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, 16,847 to 12,616. If you have any aspirations of hard-core gaming on either of these phones, Nokia's offering will definitely be more up to the task of running games like PUBG Mobile and Injustice 2. That said, don't expect blazing frame rates at this price \u2014 you'll have to spend $500 or more if you really want to play triple-A titles the way they were meant to run.\nWinner: Nokia 6.1\nBattery and Charging\nCouple those efficient chipsets with the 3,000-mAh batteries inside both of these phones, and you'd expect great results. However, only the Nokia 6.1 delivered an above-average runtime in our testing, lasting 10 hours and 24 minutes while streaming websites on T-Mobile's LTE network. The Moto G6 paled in comparison, turning in a time of 9 hours and 24 minutes \u2014 nearly a half hour less than the 9:48 smartphone average.\nMORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life\nBoth phones support Qualcomm's Quick Charge protocol over USB Type-C, meaning they'll reach about half capacity in 30 minutes connected to the stock adapter. However, neither handset supports wireless charging.\nWinner: Nokia 6.1\nSoftware\nMotorola and Nokia have similar philosophies with regard to software. The Moto G6 and Nokia 6.1 each run clean installations of Android Oreo devoid of bloatware and UI customizations, and they're better devices for it.\nThese are premium software experiences on budget hardware. However, the Nokia 6.1's outlook for updates and continued support is more promising because it is an Android One-branded device. That means users can expect two years of software updates and three years of security patches, which is a year longer in both instances than Moto G6 owners are guaranteed to see.\nNokia 6.1Add to that Motorola's spotty track record with regard to pushing out its Android updates on time, and the Nokia 6.1 really starts to pull ahead. The software on Android One devices originates from Google and is pushed out very quickly, just like on the company's high-end Pixel phones.\nBecause of the extra year of support, the Nokia 6.1's lifespan should be a bit longer than the Moto G6's, which will probably only get an upgrade to Android P late this year or early next, and that will probably be it.\nHowever, that's not to say Motorola hasn't given G6 owners perks of their own. The Moto app includes exclusive shortcuts and gestures that make the device even smoother to use. Those include One-Button Nav, which uses gestures on the front-facing fingerprint sensor to replace the traditional three-key bar, as well as longtime favorites like chopping to activate the flashlight and twisting to fire up the camera.\nUltimately, Motorola and Nokia are nearly equal on the software front. But the prospect of continued support for the Nokia 6.1 gives it the edge.\nWinner: Nokia 6.1\nValue and Availability\nThe $249 Moto G6 comes in at a price that's $20 less expensive than the Nokia 6.1, and it works on more carriers, too. While the Nokia 6.1 only works on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile, the Moto G6 also picks up CDMA bands, so it'll run just fine on Verizon, Sprint and likely any other network you can name.\nThe Moto G6 also belongs to Amazon's line of Prime Exclusive phones. Subscribers to the service can get the device for $234. There is also a variant with twice the storage and 4GB of RAM for $299. The Nokia 6.1 only comes in a 32GB configuration, but both phones feature microSD slots for expandable storage.\nWinner: Moto G6\nOverall Winner: Nokia 6.1\nIt might come as a surprise, but Nokia has truly arrived with its latest budget phone. The Nokia 6.1 takes the same attention to detail that most manufacturers reserve for their priciest products and passes that along to consumers who don't need class-leading performance, but still want a polished device that will last them for years to come.\n}}

{{Gartner has just released its Q1 figures for mobile handset sales, and the key takeaway is that Android continues to steal the show, led by handset maker Samsung. Google\u2019s mobile platform now accounts for nearly 75% of all handset sales, a jump of almost 20 percentage points on a year ago, and equating to 156 million devices sold in the three-month period. Smartphones sales grew by 63 million units to 210 million for the quarter, making up nearly half of all mobile phone sales overall, at 425 million. With the number of mobile handset sales up by a mere 0.7% on a year ago, it\u2019s clear that higher-end devices are very the much growth engine for the mobile industry at the moment.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of some of the more interesting figures from Gartner.\nAlthough Samsung does not release exact sales figures for its devices, Gartner estimates that the Korean giant is the biggest of them all: it accounted for almost 31% of all smartphones sold in the period, with Apple in number-two with 18%. It\u2019s quite a change from last year, when the two were nearly level, with just 5 percentage points separating them. The widening gap, and Samsung\u2019s growth, will continue into the quarter ahead, it seems, led by the popularity of the company\u2019s newest flagship model.\n\u201cWe expect the new Galaxy S4 to be very popular despite being more of an evolution than a truly revolutionary device compared to the S3,\u201d writes Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner.\nOn the other hand, the fact remains that at least some appear to still be holding out for the next iPhone rather than going for the iPhone 5; and Apple meanwhile is still holding back from releasing new, low-cost models that might help it along more in emerging markets and compete more comprehensively against the huge range of Android devices out there.\nThe gap between the two biggest brands and number three continues to be a big one, with Samsung very much taking the lead here. \u201cThere are two clear leaders in the OS market and Android\u2019s dominance in the OS market is unshakable,\u201d Anshul writes.\nTogether, Apple and Samsung accounted for 49 million handset sales. This is down by 1.1 million from a year ago, and as the smartphone market continues to grow, the players who are vying to be the next big challengers continues to churn. LG swapped places with Huawei, and is currently at number-three at 4.8 million units (with a strong showing from some of its newer 4G handsets and its lower-cost smartphone range). Huawei\u2019s 4.4 million, however, shows that it continues to press ahead, as does fellow Chinese handset maker ZTE, which rounds out the top-five:\nSamsung, unsurprisingly, is also leading in the overall mobile category, which also counts sales of lower-end feature phones. Its share there is now 23.6%, topping 100 million units.\nJust as Samsung is widening the gap against Apple in smartphones, it\u2019s doing the same with Nokia in the overall rankings. The Finnish giant is still number-two but with a 14.8% share, a drop of 5 percentage points on last year.\nLooking at mobile platform prominence in smartphones, Android\u2019s current 74.4% market share is nothing short of astounding in terms of its increase, particularly considering that at this point there is no sign of it slowing down.\nGartner\u2019s numbers, it should be noted, are some 10% higher than those from Kantar Worldpanel Comtech that were released at the end of April: a sign of the margin of error between different analysts\u2019 estimates resulting from different counting methods. Here are yet more numbers from IDC, which claims that smartphones outshipped feature phones, and Canalys, which was also more bullish than Gartner on smartphone numbers at a 300 million estimate.\nBack to Gartner: the 156 million units sold in the quarter is actually almost double what was sold in the same period a year ago. Android is without a doubt riding the very crest of the smartphone wave: Gartner points out that smartphones accounted for 49.3% of sales of mobile phones worldwide, up from 34.8% in Q1 of 2012, and 44% in the fourth quarter of 2012.\nApple continues to grow but at a slower pace, managing to increase its share by a \u201cmere\u201d 5 million. BlackBerry (still called RIM by Gartner: hello rebranding!) continues to drop, indicating that at least so far, its big BB10 attack has yet to bear significant fruit. Microsoft is showing a respectable doubling of growth to nearly 6 million units, but that is pretty tiny when you look back to Android and its 156 million. It shows that a significant amount of work remains to be done by Microsoft and partners like Nokia if it expects to get anywhere within spitting distance of Android, or even Apple.\nStill, the cautionary tale of Symbian remains a sign of how fast a handset maker can fall from grace. It\u2019s now at 0.3 percent of sales now that Nokia has discontinued its production of the once market-leading devices \u2014 although its share was falling fast even before that.\nGartner points out that Asia is currently the market driver for mobile phone sales worldwide, accounting for more than half of all sales, with China remaining the biggest single market.\n\u201cMore than 226 million mobile phones were sold to end users in Asia\/Pacific in the first quarter of 2013, which helped the region increase its share of global mobile phones to 53.1 per cent year-on-year,\u201d writes Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. \u201cIn addition, China saw its mobile phone sales increase 7.5% in the first quarter of 2013, and its sales represented 25.7 per cent of global mobile phone sales, up nearly 2 percentage points year-on-year.\u201d\n}}

{{Detroit Become Human E3 Trailer: Do Androids Dream of QTEs? by Hannah Shaw-Williams\n\u2013 on Jun 13, 2016\nin Game News Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nVideo game developer Quantic Dream, and its lead auteur David Cage, has definitely produced some divisive and even derided games, but it's hard to deny that the studio has a unique vision. With an emphasis on (occasionally very weird) interactive storytelling and cutting-edge motion capture, Quantic Dream's previous titles include mystery drama games like Heavy Rain and Indigo Prophecy, and 2013's supernatural\/sci-fi game Beyond: Two Souls, which featured Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe in mo-cap roles.\nNow Quantic Dream has revealed its latest project at E3 2016 with a trailer that might be enough to gauge the interest of even the studio's harshest critics. Detroit: Become Human appears to be another title in the traditional Quantic Dream framework - that is to say, a somewhat weird, sci-fi-oriented, storytelling-focused thriller\/drama with lots of indulgent close-ups of characters' faces to show off the animation. However, it also demonstrates a bold focus on branching narrative paths, something that the studio has flirted with quite a lot in the past.\nThe gameplay trailer casts players in the role of Connor, an android negotiator charged with talking down another android, who has gone rogue and taken a little girl hostage. As the footage demonstrates, the player can choose to either charge right in, or stop and investigate the crime scene for clues and tools that might help them. They can also choose to try to overpower the hostage-taker using force, or talk him down. Whatever approach you take, it seems that there is a good outcome, a very bad outcome, and a few outcomes in between.\nChoice-and-consequence gameplay is simultaneously one of the most interesting avenues that developers are pursuing right now, and one of the most challenging. Though titles such as survival horror game Until Dawn and Telltale Games' collection of episodic narrative-based games have been praised for their recent efforts in the genre, the fact remains that it's notoriously difficult to make a player feel like their choices in a game actually matter. After all, for each varied outcome that the studio puts effort into designing, the percentage of players who will actually see that outcome becomes smaller. In a medium like video games, where the developer's time and resources are always restricted, designing branching narrative paths is an exercise in thriftiness.\nDetroit: Become Human is based on a tech demo from 2012 called \"Kara\", later updated in 2015 with a new trailer that showed the eponymous android emerging into the world (complete with PlayStation 4 graphics), and revealed the game's new title. While some interested gamers may be surprised or even alarmed to see Kara absent from this trailer, it's worth noting that Quantic Dream has a history of making games with multiple playable characters.\nSpeculation about the future of artificial intelligence isn't exactly new ground in science fiction, but it is fertile ground, and we're interested to find out more about Quantic Dream's take on it.\nWe'll keep you updated on Detroit: Become Human as more information becomes available.\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice Gameplay Trailer Is Five Minutes Of Greatness\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n}}

{{Toyota is finally adding Android Auto support to its dashboards, with sources claiming a deal has been struck between Google and the Japanese automaker. The car company has been one of the more resistant firms to the idea of allowing smartphone-makers to colonize their infotainment touchscreen, only agreeing to Apple CarPlay support back in January of this year.\nAll along, Toyota\u2019s stated objection to systems like CarPlay and Android Auto had been safety and security. On the one hand, Toyota maintained, it wasn\u2019t necessarily convinced that the smartphone-based systems did enough to avoid distracting drivers. At the same time, it also had lingering concerns about issues like driver data privacy.\nThat thawed, for Apple CarPlay at least, at the start of the year. Toyota announced that it would be supporting Apple\u2019s system first in the 2019 Avalon, its luxury sedan, before CarPlay spread to other models in the range. However, though the Avalon offers Qi wireless charging, it does not offer wireless CarPlay support, still a relative rarity in the industry.\nToyota\u2019s resistance to Android Auto, though, has proved to be more stubborn. Earlier this year, company execs confirmed that the car-maker had been in negotiations with Google about adding Android Auto support, but said that lingering security worries had scuppered any immediate announcement. However, nobody would detail exactly what those concerns might be.\nUnlike Apple with CarPlay, Google takes a more open-minded approach to what Android Auto can do. Third-party apps, for instance, are more broadly permitted, though Google does have interface requirements which limit how much potentially distracting content can be shown on-screen in the car. In contrast, Apple maintains a much tighter grip on CarPlay apps, only allowing third-party navigation titles \u2013 like Google Maps \u2013 for instance with the arrival of iOS 12 earlier this month.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2018s sources, Toyota and Google\u2019s agreement could lead to an official announcement as soon as October. A spokesperson for the automaker declined to comment on that, though said that Toyota did recognize that drivers wanted Android Auto support.\nToyota has been the biggest hold-out in Android Auto so far, though the company hasn\u2019t been completely averse to smartphone integration. Earlier in 2018 it announced it would enable Amazon Alexa support in its infotainment system, for example, using the retailer\u2019s voice-controlled AI for streaming music, controlling smart home devices, and answering general knowledge questions. Toyota is also using SmartDeviceLink, a rival platform developed by Ford for hooking up a phone to the dashboard.\nWhat\u2019s unclear is whether \u2013 should the Google deal announcement indeed be forthcoming \u2013 recent Toyota models will be able to add Android Auto in a firmware update. Apple CarPlay support requires the newest version of the automaker\u2019s infotainment system, Entune 3.0, leaving earlier vehicles out of luck. There\u2019s no telling whether even that will be compatible, or if drivers will have to wait until they buy a new Toyota to get support for Android Auto.\n}}

{{Password managers are become more and more popular. Especially with the rise in hacks we\u2019ve seen hit Yahoo, Target, Ubuntu, Steam and many more. One of the most important devices to keep secure is your smartphone. With that in mind, these are some of the best password managers for Android. Allowing users to create strong passwords and keep them all in one place for ease of use.\nThe idea behind a password manager is simple. Rather than use the same easy to guess code over and over again, or have to remember multiple logins for all the sites we visit online, let a manager do it for you. If you\u2019re using the same password for every site you need one of these apps. It isn\u2019t a question of if you\u2019ll get hacked, it\u2019s when.\nRead: Yahoo! Hacked: What Should I Do Now?\nPassword Managers are loaded with features too. Most will generate a strong password for you, save it, auto-fill login forms, and even sync with your desktop. Meaning improved security and easy access no matter what you\u2019re doing. Read on for more details and some great managers worth trying today.\nIn 2017 cybersecurity should be a top priority. Which means weak passwords or using the same one over and over again won\u2019t cut it anymore. If hackers gain access to one account, they can essentially take over everything you do. Research from 2016 shows millions still use things like \u201cpassword\u201d as their password. Not to mention its the same one for every site. In fact, \u201c123456\u201d was the most-used password in 2016. That\u2019s terrible.\nIf you fall into the above category, we\u2019re here to help. Creating an extremely strong password that\u2019s different for every site can be easy, and storing them is too. That\u2019s where a manager comes in. Below is a list of some of the best options, and our slideshow below goes into more details. Along with download links to try one today.\nBest Password Managers for Android\nLastPass\n1Password\nKeeper\nDashlane\nEnpass\nSafeInCloud\nThe Android app 1Password will generate a password, remember it for you, and even works on a computer. We used the generator to get \u201cd:t\\p,?B2=KV>[r%\u201d which as you can see would be extremely hard for hackers to figure out. Let alone us trying to remember it and type it in daily.\nYou don\u2019t have to remember a confusing password either, so it can be extremely long and strong. These apps do all the hard work. Most from our list below have excellent features for free users, or are even more powerful for a small fee. At this point we\u2019d go as far as to say you can\u2019t afford not to use one.\nAt the end of the day use a password manager for Android to create multiple strong passwords for everything you do. Then lock that all behind one more super password for the app. Enable two-factor authentication, or access them all with a fingerprint. It\u2019s that easy. Without further delay, here are the best password managers for Android.\n}}

{{Sometimes you just need a temporary, disposable phone number. Why? Maybe you\u2019re not too sure about that dude you just met, but you want to give him a chance. Maybe you don\u2019t want weirdos from Craigslist calling you once your couch is gone. There are all sorts of use cases, some less shady than others \u2014 and hey, I ain\u2019t judgin\u2019.\nBack in August of last year, an app called Burner came along that popularized the concept of disposable numbers at the push of a button. After 9 months as an iOS-only app, Burner is today launching on Android.\nFor the uninitiated, here\u2019s how it works: You open the app. You push the \u201cCreate Burner\u201d button. You pick an area code and choose which number your new burner should forward to. Click another button, and you\u2019re done \u2014 you\u2019ve now got a new, secondary phone number that connects to your real number, and it can be used to send and receive both calls and texts. When you\u2019re done, you just trash the number and forget about it.\nThe free-to-download Burner app comes with one free Burner number, but the pricing gets a bit wonky after that. At its most basic level, 2 bucks gets you 3 credits, which is good for a \u201cMini Burner\u201d \u2014 a number that lasts 7 days, 20 voice minutes, or 60 texts, whichever comes first.\nWhile Burner was the first app to really strike oil with this concept, it\u2019s not the first of its kind on Android. Hushed \u2014 an app which Burner\u2019s CEO actually called out in our comments for being too similar to their app \u2014 launched on Android back in January before rolling out on iOS a few months later.\nIt\u2019s important to note that while apps like Burner offer user-to-user anonymity, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna hide you from the heavy backhand of the law. Burner is a legally operated U.S. business, after all; if the police come a-knockin\u2019 with subpoena in hand, they\u2019ll turn over your data. So don\u2019t do anything dumb.\nI asked Ad Hoc, the company behind Burner, for some stats (like how many Burners they\u2019d sold so far), but they\u2019re keeping those numbers close to the chest. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources that the team has been making money hand over fist \u2014 which makes sense, given that Burner has been sitting in the Top 10 chart for utilities in the iOS App Store for months now.\nSpeaking of iOS, the company also updated their iOS app this morning. They\u2019ve improved notifications to make it more obvious when you\u2019ve got a missed call or voicemail, added better call history management, and now allow you to customize your voicemail greeting.\nBurner is backed by 500 Startups, David Cohen, and a bunch of other angel investors.\nWhile Burner plans to launch the Android app today, it hadn\u2019t hit the Play Store at the time of publishing. I\u2019ll update this article with a link as soon as I notice the app go live. Update: Here\u2019s the Google Play link\nNow, go!

{{It's just over a year old, but Android TV has yet to find much success.\nThe smart TV platform, launched last year by Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the search giant's alternative to the Roku, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. But it hasn't made a dent in terms of market share, and its support has been rather lackluster. As Google's competition ramps up, Android TV could be left behind.\nA new Chromecast, but no new Nexus Player\nGoogle is unique among the many tech giants vying for living room supremacy -- it's the only firm actively supporting two distinct smart TV platforms. In addition to Android TV, it also offers Chromecast, the streaming dongle that lets owners beam content to their TV using a paired smartphone, tablet, or PC. Chromecast is inexpensive, and it's proven to be quite popular, but it's not a true set-top alternative, as it lacks a dedicated interface and remote control.\nLate last month at a special hardware event, Google announced two new Chromecasts, but did not unveil any new Android TV hardware, putting the platform into a strange predicament this holiday shopping season.\nConsumers looking for a set-top box this fall will have many options to choose from, including the recently announced Roku 4, upcoming Apple TV refresh, and the new 4K Fire TV. Google's own Android TV-powered Nexus Player is nearly a year old and doesn't stack up well with these devices.\nGraphics card maker NVIDIA launched the Android TV-powered Shield TV this past summer. It's every bit as powerful as its competitors, but it's more expensive. Starting at $199 (and going up to as much as $349) it's more of a video game console-alternative than a streaming set-top box. NVIDIA has used the new Apple TV to highlight its offering, but has yet to disclose just how many units it's actually sold.\nAn entirely different strategy\nInstead, Google appears to be pursuing a different strategy with Android TV. Rather than convince consumers to purchase a dedicated set-top box like Roku, Amazon, or Apple, Google is working to bring Android TV directly to televisions and cable boxes.\nSharp, Sony, TCL, HiSense, and Philips have all signed on to Google's platform. If you purchase a new Sony Bravia TV, there's a good chance it will be powered by Google's operating system. Japan's KDDI and Italy's Telecom Italia have also pledged to use Android TV to power their cable boxes.\nOf course, that doesn't cover everyone. Samsung and LG are the market leaders where it comes to TV shipments, and both are currently wed to their own rival smart TV platforms (Tizen for Samsung, webOS for LG). Vizio, a rising star, is also notably absent. Two paid-TV operators is a start, but there are dozens in the U.S. alone.\nIf Google can make Android TV ubiquitous, consumers may struggle with the prospect of spending money on a dedicated set-top box. If your TV has Android TV built in, why spend an additional $149 on an Apple TV?\nBut TV replacement cycles are long -- around 6 to 10 years on average. Even if Google manages to win over the bulk of TV manufacturers, it will take years to build a substantial base, leaving ample time for Apple and Amazon to construct compelling ecosystems.\nGoogle isn't giving up on Android TV, but is pursuing a different strategy than its rivals -- a strategy that doesn't necessitate new hardware.\n}}

{{Android, Google\u2019s open source mobile operating system, has evolved past being just a platform for mobile phones, finding it\u2019s way into digital photo frames, satellite navigation units, tablets and even laptops.\nHighlighting the versatility of Android, a new product that started production yesterday which is slightly bigger than most Android powered devices; the Roewe 350, has become the world\u2019s first Android equipped automobile.\nThe car features a DVD\/GPS system that runs on Android 2.1, the latest kernel release from Google. The system will enable drivers to gain access to real-time traffic reports and allows for direct web access from within the car. Being constantly connected, the car also allows the driver to be contacted via online chat, which could be an interesting point for road safety groups.\nFor those not familiar with the Roewe brand, the company is an amalgamation of the Chinese company SAIC and the old British car manufacturer Rover\/MG. According to TwitTown, SAIC bought the Rover 25 and 75 models in 2004, just before MG Rover went into administration, producing the cars in China under both the MG and Roewe names.\nIt\u2019s not known quite how the car will be connected to internet, whether it will feature an inbuilt 3G card or allow third-party wireless WAN cards.\nThe Roewe 350 is due to be officially launched at the Beijing Auto Show next month.\nRead next: Treegr - A New Approach To Accommodation Classifieds\n}}

{{At today's Nexus event, Google unveiled the new LG-made Nexus 5X, Huawei's Nexus 6P, a new Chromecast duo and a new entrant in the premium Pixel lineup. The Pixel C is Google's new tablet running that's directly aimed at taking on Microsoft's Surface and Apple's iPad Pro.\nThe Pixel C has a 10.2-inch 308ppi screen and runs Google's new enhanced Android 6.0 Marshmallow rather than Chrome OS.

{{Microsoft announced today that it is bringing the full Xbox Live experience to iOS and Android games on mobile devices. It is part of its larger Microsoft Game Stack initiative to expand the offering of cloud-based tools for game developers. Sadly, the rumor that Xbox Live was coming to Nintendo Switch isn\u2019t yet happening.\nSome iOS and Android games already have Xbox Live Achievements, but this feature is only enabled in titles from Microsoft Studios. With the new push, Xbox Live will expand from around 400 million Xbox and PC gaming devices with 68 million active players to more than two billion devices in the future.\n16-year-old Xbox Live is considered another set of features and tools in Microsoft Game Stack, and Microsoft views it as a safe and inclusive gaming network that has broken down boundaries in how gamers connect across devices.\nAs part of Microsoft Game Stack, Xbox Live provides identity and community services. Under Game Stack, Xbox Live will expand its cross-platform capabilities, as it will introduce a new software development kit (SDK) that brings this community to iOS and Android devices.\n\u201cPeople should have the freedom to play the games they want, on the devices they want, with the people they want,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president gaming cloud at Microsoft, in a press briefing. \u201cWe are here to empower game devs to build the game of their dreams, and we will support them on whatever platform they choose, be it console, PC, or mobile.\u201d\nImage Credit: Microsoft\nMobile developers will now be able to reach some of the most highly engaged and passionate gamers on the planet with Xbox Live, Microsoft said.\nWith the new Xbox Live SDK, developers can use Microsoft\u2018s trusted identity network to support log-in, privacy, online safety and child accounts. Game developers can select what features they want in how they build and update their games. Developers can now enable achievements, friends lists, club memberships, Gamerscore, and \u201chero\u201d stats, which have their own out-of-game experience, to keep gamers engaged.\nChoudhry said, \u201cWe believe so strongly in community and Xbox Live really being at the heart of our gaming community. And if you\u2019ve watched what we\u2019ve done, especially with Minecraft, over the past few years, we\u2019ve taken Xbox Live to as many platforms that Minecraft is on as possible, really uniting all those communities together with a consistent, singular experience for those gamers. And we\u2019re incredibly excited to say that we are now making that opportunity available to developers with our new Mobile SDK for iOS and Android.\u201d\nOn the safety side, game developers can use Xbox Live services that protect players, such as safety block, mute, and account permissions.\n\u201cAll these features are designed to be turnkey for developers large and small, so they can bring that Xbox Live experience that gamers know and love on console and PC to iOS and Android,\u201d Choudhry said.\nMicrosoft said that Xbox Live isn\u2019t yet coming to the Nintendo Switch or the PlayStation 4. But Choudhry said Microsoft wants to take Xbox Live to as many platforms as possible.\n\u201cAt the heart of Microsoft\u2019s strategy is an ambition to become fully platform agnostic as it believes this is the way it will drive [business] to its development tools and cloud business, and how it will extend its audience at the consumer end,\u201d said Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at market researcher IHS Markit, in an email. \u201cAside from wide platform support for Microsoft tools \u2013 developers can take an \u2018a la carte\u2019 approach to selecting services in Game Stack \u2013 it will also be bringing the Xbox Live SDK to iOS and Android devices.

{{Epic has once again disabled Fortnite voice chat on mobile due to stability issues. The problem started following the version 8.10 update, which had soon resulted in complaints from players on iOS who reported performance bugs. Epic narrowed the source down to the app\u2019s in-game voice chat and temporarily disabled the feature, but the problems persist.\nEpic announced earlier this week on March 12 that it had temporarily disabled the iOS Fortnite app\u2019s voice chat feature while it investigated the stability problem. Earlier today, March 14, Epic said it had re-enabled the iOS app\u2019s voice chat feature, but that it would keep on eye on the game\u2019s stability as players tested it out.\nUpdate: After enabling voice chat on iOS we\u2019re seeing an increase in stability issues. Due to these issues we\u2019ve decided to temporarily disable voice chat on iOS and Android devices while we continue to investigate. \u2014 Fortnite (@FortniteGame) March 14, 2019\nA few hours later, around 1:40PM ET on March 14, the company said that it noted an increase in stability issues after restoring voice chat to the iOS app. Because of this, the company has decided to disable voice chat on both the Fortnite Android and iOS mobile apps while it continues to work on the issue.\nBased on reports from mobile players, it appears the problem was widespread, impacting users who weren\u2019t even utilizing the voice chat feature. Complaints included shuttering, decreased frame rates, hitching during transitions, and reduced overall quality.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no word on when the in-game voice chat feature will return for mobile players; it remains available on other platforms, however.

{{Popular bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.info is releasing a major new version of its Android app, allowing you to store, receive and send bitcoins directly from your Android phone. The key thinking behind the update is to make bitcoin more accessible. It hides the complexity of the protocol in order to encourage mainstream user adoption.\n\u201cOur Android app has to do with making bitcoin so easy to use that people don\u2019t even have to think about addresses for example,\u201d co-founder and CEO Nicolas Cary told me in a phone interview. \u201cThat stuff exists in bitcoin, but just like there are complicated things happening in email, they are hidden.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you explain why bitcoin is valuable, 99 percent of people understand that it\u2019s useful. But it gets a little intimidating when they actually start using bitcoin\u201d\nSo here\u2019s what you can expect from the new app. If you want to send bitcoins to someone, you can just browse your address book and tap on someone\u2019s name. After that, there are two possibilities. If this person is already a bitcoin user with an associated bitcoin address, it will simply send the bitcoins. If it\u2019s someone new, it will send an email with a redemption code so that they can get their money.\nAlso coming with today\u2019s update, there is a map view of with merchants who accept bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s a world\u2019s first,\u201d Cary said. \u201cWe verified every single one of these merchants and we\u2019re bringing new ones every week.\u201d\nFinally, there are a lot of education features. When you create a wallet, Blockchain will help you understand how to manage your bitcoins. It will tell you to set a very strong password and two-factor authentication, it will suggests backup solutions, and it will show you tutorial videos.\n\u201cWhen you explain why bitcoin is valuable, 99 percent of people understand that it\u2019s useful. But it gets a little intimidating when they actually start using bitcoin,\u201d Cary said.\nAs always with Blockchain, Cary also defended the company\u2019s decentralized approach during our interview. Blockchain COO Peter Smith already said on stage at Disrupt NY that people shouldn\u2019t trust bitcoin services that centralize everything. Most startups try to reproduce the old banking system and actually store bitcoins on their servers. As Mt.Gox has shown us, these services can be compromised.\nInstead, Blockchain develops open-source wallets, and the user is handling his or her own bitcoins. \u201cWe are more like a storage service, \u201d Cary said. \u201cWe store encrypted files as a backup. When a user logs into the website, it fetches that file and decrypts it. Blockchain never sees this user\u2019s bitcoins.\u201d\nIt means that Blockchain can\u2019t actually take a small transaction fee when a user sends bitcoins like other services. That\u2019s why the company relies on advertisement. There are two million registered users on Blockchain.info and using the apps. Hundreds of millions of people visit Blockchain\u2019s websites every month (Blockchain.info, Zeroblock and Bitcoin.com). But the startup is still mostly known for its open source wallets.\nThe company has upcoming updates for its other wallets as well. \u201cThe Android wallet is the first update to our wallets. We\u2019re bringing branding, design and feature parity to Chrome, Firefox, the website and the mobile apps,\u201d Cary said.\nRecently, Apple made a U-turn when it comes to wallet apps in the App Store. The company is now accepting bitcoin transfer apps again. When I asked Cary whether the company has plans to come back to iOS, his answer was \u201cyes, as soon as possible.\u201d\nBut it might not be in the App Store at first. \u201cWe are building an HTML5 wallet, and we\u2019ve built a pairing solution for credentials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe completely reengineered the QR code reader to work in HTML5. We\u2019ll be open-sourcing that as well.\u201d\nAt a larger scale, as Blockchain is developing the most popular wallet apps in the world, it has the opportunity to improve how transactions are handled. If two Blockchain users want to exchange bitcoins, sharing an address through a QR code might not be the most elegant solution.\nInstead, the company could take advantage of its massive user base to switch to NFC or Bluetooth-LE. If two nearby users are using Blockchain\u2019s apps, you could pick the other person\u2019s name in a nearby list. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some research and development,\u201d Cary said. It might take a while, but these improvements might be a much-needed simplification of the bitcoin protocol to bring the cryptocurrency to the next ten million people.\n[gallery ids=\"1031961,1031962,1031963\"]\n}}

{{Share\nAndroid TV didn\u2019t get much stage time at Google\u2019s I\/O 2016 keynote Wednesday, but according to the official Android blog, Google\u2019s TV OS and streaming TV platform is expanding its reach into some more TVs and set-top boxes, and has gained an impressive array of new streaming app partners.\nFor televisions, Sony will continue to use Android TV as its OS of choice for its 2016 Bravia TV line. Sony will soon be joined by RCA, which is expected to introduce its first Android TV models to U.S. customers later this year. In Europe, Beko, Grundig and Vestel will introduce Android TV models in June.\nFor set-top boxes, Sharp\u2019s NetPlayer, as well as Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi\u2019s mysterious 4K set-top box, will run the Android TV platform.\nGoogle has also added some key streaming service apps, namely CNN, Comedy Central, MTV, Freeform, Nickelodeon, Spotify, Starz, WATCH ABC, WATCH Disney Channel, WATCH Disney Junior, and ESPN. The addition of Starz was noted earlier Wednesday, when it was also learned that Starz would launch HDR programming through its over-the-top app first.\nOne might hope that would mean Android N would then allow Android TV to support HDR, and, indeed, it does. Other new features coming to Android TV include picture-in-picture for browsing around while a video plays in the background, and recording APIs for recording live TV programming.\nGoogle Cast is also making an expansion. The system, which allows users to \u201ccast\u201d content to their TV without the need for add-on hardware like the Chromecast, first appeared in Vizio\u2019s lineup of P-series televisions. Now, Google Cast will reportedly be coming to Magnavox, Philips, Polaroid, Toshiba, and Westinghouse televisions, thus putting some pressure on Roku-enabled TVs.\nWith Google Home on the horizon, Google is building a pretty compelling case for its home entertainment ecosystem \u2014 and a strong alternative to Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker \u2014 by allowing users to launch programming on their televisions or set-top boxes using voice commands. What is not clear is whether Google\u2019s new digital assistant will ultimately end up enabled on the televisions themselves, or if users will have to invest in a Home speaker.\n}}

{{If you like short films from indies and have an Android device then there\u2019s good news for you after Viddsee launched a native Android app.\nViddsee specializes in showcasing the work of independent filmmakers based out of Asia. Rather than cinema-length flicks, we\u2019re talking 5-, 10- or 15-minute shows across a range of dramas that fit nicely into a commute to work, or just filling idle time.\nUp to now, the service has been available via a native iOS app, desktop web and mobile web. Co-founder Derek Tan told TechCrunch that there\u2019s been plenty of demand for an Android app, with 70 percent of its mobile web users on devices running the Google-owned mobile operating system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time \u2014 we\u2019ve had Android users asking us since our iOS launch last November,\u201d Tan said.\nLike its iOS cousin, the app features offline playback, weekly curation, English subtitles and playlist queuing. In addition, Android users will see that offline tracks begin to sync automatically when they have a WiFi connection, while there is also a new \u2018discover\u2019 section to help find films to match a user\u2019s occasion or specific need \u2014 e.g. \u2018under five minutes\u2019.\n\u201cThere are lots of user-generated short films on YouTube and other places, but not enough emphasis on cinematic short film content,\u201d Tan explained in an interview. \u201cWe target movies for the internet, which are very different to others, such as commercial or feature films.\u201d\nTan said that Viddsee is working with a number of brands, such as camera maker Nikon, to create content that is sponsored, as opposed to introducing pre-roll adds. Placing videos on Viddsee, he said, can be a better platform or complementary to a microsite or YouTube account where the content may not fit with a brand\u2019s positioning or be easily discovered.\nRather than merely being a repository for films, Viddsee aims to be an editorialized discovery service. To that end, it launched BUZZ, a curated site to help promote quality films, and Tan said that one-third of its traffic is driven by social media sites.\nSince my editor discloses his IFTTT socks, I\u2019ll go on record saying that I own a (rather nice) t-shirt from Viddsee. (Startup tip, you can do a lot worse than having Uniqlo make your company tees.)\n}}

{{Every new Android version kicks off two guessing games. The first is at the start of the development cycle when users try to guess which sweet dessert the release will be named after. The second is when the final version is finally formally launched. That\u2019s when users start guessing when and if their precious smartphone is actually eligible for the update. To help make their customers guess less, some manufacturers have chimed in, publicly committing to bringing Android 9 Pie to at least some of their latest devices \u201csoon\u201d.\nHTC is one of the first to speak up to reassure fans that they\u2019re getting their Pie. At least fans that one the latest HTC U12+ and last year\u2019s U11 modes like the U11+, U11, and U11 Life with Android One. No other devices have been mentioned, even those that would normally fall under the two-year support coverage. As to when that will actually happen, \u201call in due time\u201d. HTC is perhaps memorable for being the first OEM to publish an infographic detailing the Android software update process that practically placed the delay blame on carriers.\nWe're pleased as pie to confirm updates to Android Pie for the HTC U12+, U11+, U11, and U11 life (Android One). Timeframes for roll-out will be announced in due course. We can't wait to know what you think of Google's freshest slice of Android! pic.twitter.com\/mPJePFegne \u2014 HTC (@htc) August 10, 2018\nDespite having almost near stock Android, Sony hasn\u2019t exactly been fast in updating its smartphones either. So it\u2019s definitely encouraging to hear that the company won\u2019t be taking too long to bring Android 9 to its users. According to Gizchina, Sony will roll out Android Pie to six smartphone models between September and November this year. That list includes the Xperia XZ2, Xperia XZ2 Compact, Xperia XZ2 Premium, Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ1 Compact, and Xperia XZ Premium. We\u2019ll presume that the late 2018 flagship Sony is expected to unveil in a few weeks will come with Android Pie running out of the box.\nMore surprising, however, is Huawei, who hasn\u2019t been fast at all with Android updates. Especially given its heavily customized EMUI experience. Despite, that, the manufacturer is proudly confirming that the Huawei P20, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Honor 10, and Honor V10 are already being tested with the update. How long that testing will take, however, is anyone\u2019s guess.\nFor Android P\u2019s development, Google has tapped a number of partners to provide beta releases for some of their smartphones. Those, which include HMD, OPPO, Vivo, and OnePlus, have yet to announce their schedules. None of them, however, beats Essential, who got the ball rolling right on day one.\n}}

{{In mid-March, Andy Rubin stepped down as head of Android to start a \u201cnew chapter\u201d at Google. In his place, Google appointed Chrome OS head Sundar Pichai. This led to some thinking that the Android and Chrome OS would cross pollinate, but Google has said the two products will remain separate.\nThe software behind Chrome OS and Android may remain separate, but a new report out of Digitimes suggests that Google may be launching Android notebooks in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Digitimes also speculates that Pichai is the one behind the move to bring Android to Notebooks.\nEven if this rumor is true, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Android has made its way into Notebook computers. A quick search of online retailers will bring up a number of cheap Chinese-made Android Notebooks that were made possible by Google making Android open source. There\u2019s also pseudo-Notebooks, like ASUS\u2019 Transformer Prime, that blurs the line between Notebook and tablet.\nLike most of Digitime\u2019s rumors, you should probably take this report with a massive grain of salt.Of course, there\u2019s always the possibility that the next version of Android will introduce support for traditional computing environments, much like Android 3.0 introduced support for tablets. Still, it seems strange that Google would compete with its own Chromebook line by introducing Android notebooks.\nIf there is an Android notebook on the horizon, we might hear something about it at May\u2019s Google I\/O.

{{Israeli software researchers have found a way to exploit Android\u2019s Stagefright vulnerability, previously found to leave millions of devices susceptible to cyber attacks.\nStagefright was originally described as \u2018the worst Android bug ever discovered\u2019, however the exploit - dubbed \u2018Metaphor\u2019 by its creators \u2013 marks the first time the vulnerability has been compromised in the operating environment.\nAccording to Jan Vidar Krey, head of development at Norwegian security specialists Promon, Android\u2019s inconsistent patching and system updates leave far too much to chance, inviting cyber attackers to try their hand at executing malware on foreign devices:\n\u201cAlthough Google released security patches for Stagefright vulnerabilities, not every Android phone and tablet can receive and install them, leaving a large number of devices vulnerable. Metaphor, however, is an appropriate name for the flaw, which can be viewed as being representative of Android\u2019s history of shoddy security: heterogeneous but woefully predictable.\u201d\nStagefright 2.0, a second critical exploit discovered by the researchers, was found to exploit weaknesses in .mp3 and .mp4 files and remotely execute malicious code.\nKrey commented: \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that the Stagefright vulnerability is back in the news. When it was revealed, there was no resolution to the issue: patches and updates were only available for recent models. The first hack could impact up to 95 per cent of devices, so manufacturers\u2019 failure to address the flaw in the six months that passed since its discovery is a huge oversight. Sadly, consumers will ultimately pay the price.\nKrey advised: \u201cAndroid\u2019s operating system is currently the security equivalent of shark-infested water, and the only way to guarantee secure processes is to ensure your app is completely protected. When you\u2019re hosting sensitive information on applications, these threats pose a real concern. Instead, apps must be self-defending and able to identify malware as and when it appears.\n\"Until Android is able to straighten out its OS and stop leaning on dodgy patches, base layer app security must be upheld as the crux of a device\u2019s security. Whether Android alone will ever be able to offer a safe environment to carry out transactions is yet to be seen, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on it.\u201d\nThe post Protecting against Stagefright\u2019s encore appeared first on IT SECURITY GURU.\nImage source: Shutterstock\/Palto\n}}

{{Don\u2019t let their recent quiet streak fool you \u2014 the team at Eric Schmidt-backed receipt aggregator\/tracking service Slice have spent the last few months slaving away on revamped versions of their iOS and Android apps, and now that major update is ready for the purchase tracking masses.\nWith Slice 2.0, co-founder and CEO Scott Brady wanted to do more than just track packages and aggregate users\u2019 purchase histories. Perhaps the most notable addition to the updated Slice mobile apps is a new personal analytics option called Thingerprint that breaks down how much users have spent on what kinds of products, with options to drill into specific purchase categories, item types, and merchants.\nNaturally, most of my paycheck goes toward gadgets and other similarly shiny new things, so Slice\u2019s Thingerprint has branded me a \u201cGadget Geek.\u201d It may not be the most original addition to the mix \u2014 rivals Lemon and OneReceipt have taken a similar approach \u2014 but having a fairly comprehensive breakdown of your purchasing habits at your fingertips isn\u2019t the sort of thing most users would turn their noses up at.\nWhile the addition of personal analytics adds another dimension to the service, some of the updated bits were just about making Slice more accessible to particular use cases. During Slice\u2019s early days for instance, the service could only connect to and scan Yahoo! And Gmail accounts for emailed receipts and tracking notifications.\nNot so any more \u2014 Brady and his teamed fleshed out Slice 2.0 with support for iCloud, Hotmail, and AOL email accounts. Also featured prominently is the ability to manually add a new purchase to your Slice account by scanning the barcode off of a packing slip, though it should be noted that the Android version requires users to download a separate scanner app for that feature to work properly.\nSome of the additions included in this most recent update may seem like no-brainers, but the process wasn\u2019t always that straightforward. Brady confirmed to me that there was plenty of thoughtful testing and retesting before he and team signed off on the final updates.\n\u201cThe focus groups give us ideas on where we like to take our capabilities,\u201d he said \u201cWe rely pretty heavily on them, and before we go too far on any product we do plenty of testing and tweaking.\u201d\nFor what it\u2019s worth, his approach seems to be working so far. Since Slice\u2019s launch in May 2011, the service has processed and tracked over 25 million purchases, and that number is sure to grow even larger if the company eventually gives in to their users\u2019 demands.\n\u201cBehind additional email support, global availability is the second most requested feature,\u201d Brady remarked. \u201cToday we only support the U.S., but we\u2019ve created a technology that can work throughout the rest of the world.\u201d\n}}

{{Having seen Barnes & Noble\u2019s NOOKcolor gifted with Android 3.0 Honeycomb, it\u2019s now your turn to catch a jump on Google\u2019s official reveal of the tablet-centric OS. The talented guys over at xda-developers have released a NOOKcolor Honeycomb ROM and it\u2019s surprisingly functional: the touchscreen, wireless and graphics acceleration all work.\nThe hardware buttons are also functional, along with the accelerometer (for automatic screen rotation). Still to come are sound and hardware video decoding, though neither should stop NOOKcolor owners from getting a decent impression of what Honeycomb brings to the tablet table.\nIf you\u2019ve not got a NOOKcolor of your own, then head over to Android Community for the full Android 3.0 Honeycomb deep dive, and remember to join us tomorrow, Wednesday February 2, for Google\u2019s official launch event.

{{It's dead-simple to transfer files from your Android device to your computer using a USB cable or a Wi-Fi network, but sometimes you want to share files with people more remotely. Shynk is great for this, letting you set up an account to access and share files with anyone you like. Here's how it works:\nCreate a free Shynk account here. Download and install the Shynk app from here. Run Shynk and log in with the account info you just created. Head back to the Shynk Web site and click \"Phone\" near the top. You should see a file directory structure on the left with a set of files and folders shown in icons on the rest of the page.

{{Regular readers know that I\u2019ve long been a fan of the Dolphin Browser HD for Android (s goog) smartphones and tablets. In February, I offered 8 reasons why it\u2019s a \u201cmust try\u201d for any Android device owner, and Monday, the free browser adds a new feature in conjunction with the launch of the software\u2019s sixth version. Dolphin Browser HD still supports gestures, multiple tabs, and browser extensions, but now includes Webzine: a Flipboard-like, magazine layout style for reading web pages.\nI upgraded to the new version 6 of Dolphin Browser HD on my Samsung Galaxy tab and had planned to spend a short bit of time using the software, but the Webzine feature kept me engaged longer than I planned. Adding content from websites I read \u2014 such as CNN (s twx), Fierce Wireless and Android Central \u2014 to my own personal webzine was as simple as tapping the \u201cAdd a column\u201d icon. Doing so brings up a list of perhaps a few hundred sources, all categorized by topics such as \u201cNews,\u201d \u201cScience & Tech,\u201d even \u201cSocial\u201d, which adds a feed to Facebook and Twitter.\nThere\u2019s also a search function if you know the name of a content provider. I don\u2019t see a way to add any news sources however, say through an RSS feed, which is limiting. And the social feeds don\u2019t seem to use screen space effectively: I see bunches of blank space, which could be due to using the software on a 7-inch tablet.\n[slideshow]\nAside from those limitations though, the Webzine feature is an enjoyable way to consume content. It\u2019s simple to browse through article summaries, either by scrolling down the browser page or by swiping the page right to left. Tapping a story opens the full article in a pleasant format, but also includes a link to read the original article; touch the link and the story opens in a standard browser tab.\nWhen reading the full article in Webzine mode, you can swipe to the next or prior article as well. Other handy navigation tools include buttons to go back, immediately jump to the top of an article, switch to standard browser mode or share an article through email or any other installed third-party social networking app. Pulling the page down refreshes the Webzine.\nWhile the biggest new feature in this version of the Dolphin Browser is the Webzine function, the overall browsing experience provided by the software is still outstanding. All of my earlier reasons to use this third-party software to surf the web still apply, and the app seems as speedy as before, if not even faster.\nIf you\u2019re using the stock browser on an Android smartphone or tablet, you owe it to yourself to try the new Dolphin Browser, even if the magazine style layout doesn\u2019t sound appealing to you, Google\u2019s Android Market indicates that the software has been downloaded between 5 and 10 million times. After getting a taste of the improved version, I expect Dolphin Browser to cross the 10 million download mark sooner rather than later. Ironically, that figure equates nicely with today\u2019s $10 million in Series A funding news for the popular browser. Sequoia Capital led the funding round for MoboTap, the company behind the Dolphin Browser, with Matrix Partners also participating in the deal.\n}}

{{In the ongoing battle for more users and differentiation between messaging apps, today Japan\u2019s LINE has launched its newest feature: a flat-rate voice calling service called LINE Call. It expands on an already existing feature in LINE that let users call each other free via the app. Users will be able to keep their own mobile numbers for LINE Call \u2014 although \u201cphone numbers may not be displayed correctly in some regions,\u201d LINE notes.\nThe first people to get LINE Call will be Android users in eight markets \u2014 Colombia, Japan, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Thailand, and the U.S., who can download version 4.1.0 to access the service. The idea will be to expand that to more platforms and more countries over time.\nAs you can see from the diagram that Line has published listing pricing for the service, it looks like China will soon be turned on as well. Prices for landline calls start at 2 cents per minute (the US, Mexico, Peru, Spain and China when it comes on there get this cheaper rate) and progress up to 12 cents per minute (that\u2019s in the Philippines). Mobile calls range from 4 cents through to 15 cents per minute.\nThe introduction of LINE Call \u2014 first announced in February but only turned on today \u2014 helps LINE compete better against the likes of Skype and Google for cheap in-app calls using mobile data instead of users\u2019 voice minutes.\nBut it also is a way for LINE to offer an expanded service compared to its more immediate messaging competitors. Line, as of February, had 340 registered million users, without specifying how many of them are active. Messaging app leader WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook in Feburary for $19 billion, in the same month said the number of active users of its app had passed 465 million.\nIn February, WhatsApp also announced that it, too, would soon be offering voice calls but it has yet to reveal the details of what this will entail.\nHowever, WhatsApp did also say at the same time that it would soon be unveiling a new, groundbreaking deal with E-Plus in Germany. As with the voice service, it gave no more details on this, but one possibility is that whatever WhatsApp tackles in its voice service could see it more closely link up with carriers. To be clear, WhatsApp has often worked with carriers in the past on mobile data bundles.\nLINE notes that it is offering users two ways of paying for calls, either via call credits that you pre-pay for in advance (similar to Skype), or with 30-day voice plans that entail a fixed number of minutes for each month, which will work out as less expensive if you plan to use it a lot.\nIt\u2019s another revenue-generating service that could help further boost the economic prospects for LINE, which made $156 million in revenues last quarter, $120 million of that from its core product, the LINE messaging app.\nIn 2013, reports surfaced that LINE was considering an IPO this year. It\u2019s not the only Asian messaging giant that is gearing up for the public markets, apparently. Korea\u2019s Kakao and Sina Weibo are also apparently in play to list soon.\n}}

{{As recent figures have shown, 72 percent of all mobile devices being sold \u2013 not just smartphones \u2013 are now Android-based. That points to an invasion by the Google OS of emerging markets, but there\u2019s a problem: data is still way too expensive for people in such areas.\nThat\u2019s why Blaast, who we covered earlier this year, has just launched on Android. The Finnish firm\u2019s platform provides versions of popular apps that run partly in the cloud; mixed with clever compression techniques, this means lower data use. Think Snappli or Onavo\u2018s data shrinkage, but baked into the apps themselves for deployment in partnership with carriers.\nBefore now, Blaast has only been rolled out by operators in Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh on their low-end Java featurephones \u2013 a similar approach to that taken by the Eric Schmidt-funded biNu, but offering an app store rather than a fixed suite of apps. And even before this shift to Android, it\u2019s already been a big success.\n\u201cWe are bundled on over 50 million SIM cards,\u201d CEO Joonas Hjelt told me at the Slush conference in Helsinki on Tuesday. \u201cWe have over 4,000 developers, and over one million chat messages per week in just one app. That\u2019s how we\u2019re doing with featurephones.\u201d\nNow, those are very basic, lightweight apps. Stepping up to Android means more complexity, and Hjelt claims Blaast pretty much halves the amount of data those apps use, on average.\nSo how big is that data problem, really?\n\u201cIn emerging markets, it\u2019s as expensive as having an AT&T subscription and roaming in Indonesia,\u201d Hjelt said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like for the local people. [In terms of spending power] it\u2019s six to ten times more expensive than in the U.S.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the deal at launch. Indonesian operator XL is bundling the Blaast store alongside the Play Store on its Sony Xperia J. The carrier is rolling out a $5-per-month tariff for the use of Blaast apps \u2013 that\u2019s around half of the previous cheapest option in Indonesia. Alternatively, customers can opt for even cheaper deals that give them a la carte access to specific apps, such as Facebook or WhatsApp.\n\u201cBy promoting this as a channel, the operator benefits \u2013 they can lower their entry price and get more data subscribers,\u201d Hjelt said.\nBye-bye browser?\nThere may be an interesting side-effect of this whole approach.\nConsider this. For people in emerging markets, the handset is the personal computer. Many have never had a desktop and, chances are, they never will.\nBut, with data being expensive and platforms such as Blaast representing the cheapest way to get online, these people may find themselves limited to a subset of apps. (It should be noted that XL\u2019s launch deal for Blaast also includes data for general use, but that may just be a promotional offer.)\nWhere data is more reasonably-priced, the browser is one of the most important elements of any smartphone or tablet. Take it out of the picture, and you excise the open web; we\u2019re talking about a curated, closed experience. Better than nothing, for sure, but not open.\nAt some point, the cost of data will level out in such regions (although Hjelt maintains that \u201cmaking things faster and more affordable will never go out of fashion\u201d). Until that happens, we may be looking at a serious geo-economic split in the way people use and experience the internet.\n}}

{{Google CEO Larry Page said 550,000 devices running Google\u2019s mobile operating system Android are activated daily during the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call today.\nThe number of daily activations is steadily increasing. Just over two weeks ago, Senior Vice President of Android Andy Rubin revealed via Twitter that there were 500,000 Android devices activated each day. He also said that the rate of growth was increasing by 4.4 percent each week, which matches up with the device activation number stated in the earnings call.\nIf Google can maintain that growth rate, it will reach over a million daily Android device activations by October. Yet, with the growing number of Android-enabled tablets entering the market and lower costs to consumers on both smartphones and tablets, daily activations could increase much faster.\nTo give some perspective of how big the current activation numbers are, Google was activating about 200,000 Android devices per day in August 2010 \u2014 meaning daily Android device activations have more than doubled in less than a year.\n}}

Or, try Trivia Crack 2.\nDownload: HQ Trivia for Android\nAlto\u2019s Adventure (and Odyssey)\nAlto\u2019s Adventure is one of those simple yet crazy addicting games that everyone can enjoy, love, and appreciate. It won multiple awards (and game of the year) on both Android and iOS, it\u2019s that good. It\u2019s an endless runner side-scrolling game unlike anything you\u2019ve ever played before.\nYou\u2019ll be snowboarding down a mountain with Alto and his friends while trying to avoid obstacles, hit Llamas, and other fun things. The graphics are simple yet elegant, as is the soundtrack and calming music that plays in the background. It\u2019s extremely addicting, so be warned. Alto\u2019s Odyssey is the follow-up game, but I\u2019m still a big fan of the original.\nDownload: Alto\u2019s Adventure\nThe Room: Old Sins\nIf you\u2019ve played any game from \u201cThe Room\u201d series you know exactly what to expect from The Room 4: Old Sins.

You\u2019ll explore the home of an engineer that\u2019s missing, along with multiple rooms from a dollhouse in the attic. Work through the puzzles, contraptions, find random objects, and unlock secrets as you start to learn what happened to the Engineer and his wife.\nEvery game from The Room series is worth downloading this summer, just don\u2019t play it alone in your room at night.\nDownload: The Room: Old Sins\nBrawl Stars\nThe newest game mobile game as the year comes to a close is Brawl Stars. This is an all-new top-down shooter from the creators of Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. Supercell knows how to make a good game, and Brawl Stars is no exception.\nA good way to explain it is Overwatch and Clash Royale meets PUBG. It\u2019s a 3v3 battle royale game with over 20 characters and 5+ game modes. One of which, is actually a battle royale showdown mode. You collect brawlers with unique abilities and weapons, then battle other people in a variety of fun and exciting ways. It\u2019s super addicting, and will likely be one of the biggest games of 2019.\nDownload: Brawl Stars for Android\nFire Emblem: Heroes\nOne of the most popular games this year is Fire Emblem: Heroes.

It\u2019s a completely new take on puzzler games. If you love comic books, this game is for you.\nIn Framed 2 you\u2019ll solve puzzles and re-arrange panels of an animated comic book magazine until you change the outcome of the story and beat each level. Years ago, a mysterious ship smuggled precious cargo into an exotic land, and that\u2019s where the book starts. You literally control the story and comic book as you complete missions and change things around on the fly. It\u2019s amazingly fun, unique, and a blast to play in your spare time. And if you enjoy this style, we highly recommend the original game from 2014.\nDownload: Framed 2 for Android\nShadowgun Legends\nChanging gears here, Shadowgun Legends is one of the best shooter games for Android, period. MadFinger Games released this epic shooter at the end of March, and it has an amazing storyline that\u2019ll keep you hooked for months. If you\u2019re looking for a new FPS and hate Fortnite, try this.\nWhat makes Legends so great is that not only can you play the epic story campaign, they added an exciting fast-paced competitive and co-op multiplayer mode for all you online gamers.

It\u2019s the game that took the world by storm a few years ago, invaded nearby parks or landmarks, and is still going strong. In fact, the developers at Niantic continue to offer exciting new game modes, quests to acquire Mew, shiny Pokemon, Trainer battles, trading and more. They\u2019re adding so much to the game that it\u2019s almost too much to keep up with.\nPlayers can see, find, and catch various Pokemon in the real world through the camera on a phone or tablet. Catch em all, battle in gyms, or do raids to get Legendary monsters and more. And, Gen 5 is coming sometime soon.\nDownload: Pok\u00e9mon GO\nInto the Dead 2\nIt might not be the \u201cbest new Android game\u201d but Into the Dead 2 is still one of the best FPS games for mobile.

Killing anything that moves, this bloody and action-packed game is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.\nThe developers did a great job of adding an evolving storyline and multiple ending to the game, so it\u2019s never really \u201cover\u201d.

Drive some of the hottest, fastest, luxurious cars around the fastest tracks in the world. This game has stunning lifelike graphics, tons of cars to choose from or unlock, and plenty of different game modes.\nGameloft\u2019s Asphalt series set the standard for mobile gaming early on, and they continue to impress each year. In fact, this game offers over 190 supercars and bikes you can push to the limits, wreck, or even go airborne from the high-speeds and octane boosters.

Assemble a team of heroes like Batman, Flash & Wonder Woman to combat Villains, or create your own Justice League.\nIf you played the first Injustice you\u2019ll love this mobile game thanks to better fighting dynamics, new moves, and multiple new characters to enjoy. I love the 3-on-3 battles, epic graphics, and realism this brings to Android devices. Give it a try as we wait for Wonder Woman 2 to hit theaters eventually.\nDownload: Injustice 2 for Android\nNOVA Legacy\nNOVA is one of the best mobile shooter games of all times, or Android of old. They were the first developer to offer a console-like experience for Android, and they still do to this day. Millions of people love and play multiple different NOVA games.\nAs a newly retired Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance soldier, you must battle a scary new alien force before it destroys the entire world and all of humanity. This game is a mix of Crysis and HALO blend into one fine mobile shooter game. Seriously, it\u2019s almost like HALO for Android. You can even join 8v8 battles, use special powers in your suit, and get headshots all day long. It\u2019s an amazing game worth playing.\nDownload: NOVA Legacy\nSonic 4 (Sonic the Hedgehog)\nIf you\u2019re looking for a true classic game that you\u2019ll enjoy for hours on end, play Sonic 4. SEGA redesigned the game from the ground up for mobile devices, and you can play both Sonic 4 episode 1 and 2 today. Race your hedgehog through multiple levels collecting rings and defeating enemies along the way.\nSonic 4 picks up right where Sonic and Knuckles left off, so you won\u2019t miss a beat from your childhood. Each episode costs a few bucks, but they\u2019re worth it.\nDownload: Sonic 4\nBADLAND\nThis next game isn\u2019t necessarily new, but it\u2019s still one of the best Android games I\u2019ve played in years. With more than 50 million downloads and tons of awards, you know it\u2019s a game worth playing. BADLAND is an atmospheric side-scrolling action adventure platformer game. It takes place in a gorgeous forest full of various inhabitants, trees and flowers. The graphics are beautiful yet simple, as it the gameplay.\nYou tap and hold on the display to control little characters from the forest, which quickly goes from a beautiful place to a scary dark area. The game has unique controls, awesome physics, and a soundtrack you\u2019ll love. Seriously, download this if you haven\u2019t beat it already.

The classic game Pac-man designed for smartphones. PAC-MAN 256 is the maze that never ends, but be careful, as the glitch is coming for you. IT takes everything you know and love about all the original PAC-MAN games and delivers it nicely for smartphones and tablets.\nThere\u2019s a new gang of retro ghosts that\u2019ll try to track you down before you finish the maze, so be careful.\nDownload: PAC-MAN 256\nSuper Mario Run\nPac-Man and Sonic aren\u2019t the only cool (old) kids on the block, because Super Mario is officially on mobile too. In case you didn\u2019t know, Nintendo released Super Mario Run for Android and iPhone to plenty of success. This is a new kind of Mario game you can play with one hand, easily, as he runs sideways on the screen.\nIt\u2019s a side-scrolling action or adventure game that\u2019s plenty of fun, and one of the best ones available. If you love the Temple Run style, you\u2019ll enjoy Super Mario Run. It\u2019s free for the first few minutes, but eventually, you\u2019ll have to pay if you want to save the princess, enter the Toad Rally, or join the World Tour. Either way, it\u2019s still a fun and great Android game worth paying for.\nDownload: Super Mario Run\nFallout Shelter\nFrom Bethesda themselves comes Fallout Shelter, a companion game and app any Fallout fan will absolutely love. Following all the destruction you\u2019ll create a thriving community underground. Away from all the trouble that is the rest of the Fallout series. You\u2019ll build the perfect vault to live in, craft amazing things from worthless junk, enjoy the wastelands and more in this epic simulation game.\nFallout Shelter is a few years old now, but it\u2019s still one of the best free Android games you can download in 2018 and 2019. It has over 10 million downloads for a reason.\nDownload: Fallout Shelter\nClash of Clans\nLast but not least is Clash of Clans which is still one of the top overall Android games over 6 years after being released.\nClash of Clans is the original game that started it all on mobile. Build and upgrade your village, raise a clan, attack enemies and take part in epic Clan Wars. The game has evolved year in and year out for over six years and remains one of the main games I recommend to anyone. It still gets updates every few months, with a few massive updates each year. They even added a secondary village inside the main one, for those returning to the game.\nTitles like Clash of Clans and Clash Royale are extremely addicting, so use caution. I\u2019ve played Clash for over 6 years, and don\u2019t plan on stopping anytime soon. If you somehow haven\u2019t played it yet, give it a try and enjoy all the new content and continuous updates.\nDownload: Clash of Clans\nTry any of these amazing games as 2018 comes to a close, and stay tuned for exciting new titles in the coming weeks and months. We\u2019re expecting big things and even more stunning games throughout 2019.\n}}

{{Today Google revealed a bit of information on how your smartphone spends its battery life. They did this at this week\u2019s Android Dev Summit, speaking to developers about what they can do in their apps to avoid consuming massive amounts of battery life. But this isn\u2019t just about that. This is about the biggest factor in battery consumption: screen brightness! And not only that, but screen color, too!\nThe information we\u2019re looking at today comes from Google during a presentation at the 2018 Android Dev Summit. That\u2019s different from Google I\/O, for some reason \u2013 that\u2019s all about Android too, but also about Chrome, and other stuff. This was all about Android, this week, and the battery time that\u2019s most precious to all users. Mobile battery time, in smartphones, the devices most people use the most major amount of their time.\nThe first and most obvious piece of information Google shared was on screen brightness and power. This should be fairly obvious \u2013 more brightness means quicker power draw. They discovered that it\u2019s not always perfectly linear \u2013 but it\u2019s so close to linear that it might as well have been a straight line, one for one.\nNext they shared some information on their studies which, as you\u2019ll see, weren\u2019t done with the most recent hardware we have available today. They did this study with the first Google Pixel. The differences between the first Pixel and the rest are irrelevant here. What\u2019s important is the difference between power draw on max brightness between normal mode and \u201cNight Mode.\u201d Not every smartphone makes use of such a feature.\nGoogle also studied color. The color shown on a display really, truly affects how much power is drawn from the battery of the phone. As you\u2019ll see in the chart here, each color has a different amount of draw on its device\u2019s battery.\nThe next chart shows the major differences between max brightness with a color like black (which has barely any power draw) and white (which has the most power draw of all.) As white uses all the display\u2019s various components to shine, it uses the most power.\nGoogle\u2019s OOPS moment\nGoogle admitted on stage today that they\u2019d made a bit of a mistake. Not recently, but over the past several years. Since Google\u2019s Material Design initiative started, they\u2019d been pushing the use of the color white, encouraging designers to use white as their primary color for all apps and interfaces.\nABOVE: Google\u2019s slide as they explained the situation with the display brightness and the color white. Because they\u2019d been pushing white as a primary color for all Android (and other systems) software layouts.\nEven now, as the event takes place, the \u201cbaseline Material color theme\u201d as it exists at Google\u2019s official Material Design information site shows the following. Look at all that white.\nOn Primary, Background, Surface, and On Error are all white. It\u2019s not that they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 that just makes sense as a set of design defaults for all designers. But if we\u2019re aiming for ideal power drain, white shouldn\u2019t be here in its purest form, #FFFFFF ALL THE COLOR.\nDark Mode\nLuckily, as Google revealed this week, the proverbial Dark Mode can make a big difference in how much power ALL THE APPS need in Android. Google will likely continue to release Dark Mode in their apps through the future \u2013 just so long as we keep needing to have to recharge the batteries in our phones.\nI suppose they\u2019ll stop when they find that infinite renewable energy solution that allows our phones to stay powered up at all times. Keep your fingers crossed for that one \u2013 even though Dark Mode is better for your eyes, in the long run, too.\n}}

{{Microsoft have been showing off their streamlined try-before-you-buy functionality in Windows Phone 7, and at first glance this is a far slicker system than what\u2019s out there on the iPhone, Android or other platforms. Rather than developers producing two versions of their apps, free and paid, the new trial API will allow for in-app upgrades. istartedsomething has screenshots of the new UI.\nAs for what the trial versions will include, Microsoft is being admirably flexible on that, too. The API allows for everything from time-limited access to full applications through to cut-down or ad-supported trials with partial features. If the user is happy they can instantly unlock the software by paying in-app, without having to re-download a second version or jump out into the Windows Marketplace.\nCurrently the licensing system API documentation is pretty sparse, but that should change as developers and Microsoft get to grips with it. This could be a significant advantage for Windows Phone 7 users, developers and the carriers offering the handsets: after all, a single download makes for reduced network use.\n}}

{{There\u2019s no way around it: Android is a mess of disparate OEMs and legacy versions of the same operating system. While we get an idea of what\u2019s really going on with Android from Google\u2019s official numbers, Open Signal has again tapped its users to better illustrate (literally) what\u2019s going on in Android land.\nThe survey is a sampling of 682,000 Android devices, 24,093 of which are new to Open Signal this year. Of the devices in this study, 37.8 percent were Samsung handhelds; a huge percentage, and even more impressive when you consider there are 1,294 manufacturers represented.\nAs you can see in the GIF below, there are a ton of different Android devices (the movement also represents how many more manufacturers there are in 2015 when compared to 2014). Though this represents one year, Open Signal says \u201cin two years Android Fragmentation has more than doubled from the 11,868 we saw back in 2013.\u201d\nBrand fragmentation is also on display. While Samsung naturally carries the day here, a lot can be extrapolated from Open Signal\u2019s graphic. Is there really a reason we need Verizon-branded handsets? We make quite a fuss about Xiaomi, but it\u2019s in pink just to the right of ZTE \u2014 which rarely gets mentioned in the press, even though both companies are about the same size when it comes to Android devices.\nAlthough you should always use the handset you like; the operating system is what really matters. Halfway through 2015, Android is still really messy with software.\nAccording to Open Signal, 5.7 percent of Android handsets currently run a version of Android 2.3, Gingerbread. If we\u2019re being fair, Gingerbread came out when iOS 5 did, which isn\u2019t even represented (individually, at least) in this study.\nAlso interesting is the percentage of KitKat, which may have more to do with APIs. In Open Signal\u2019s study, KitKat\u2019s API level and operating system dominate into 2015. Bleeding edge platforms like Android 5.0 and 5.1 are well in the minority.\nCompared to iOS, there are three times the versions of Android found in this study. Apple\u2019s iOS 8 commands 85 percent of the handsets on test, with only 2 percent having anything prior to iOS 7. Android 5.0 and 5.1 (Lollipop) combine for a 12.4 percent share of Android software. To match iOS 8\u2019s percentage, Android has to count all versions back through Jelly Bean.\nPositively, Android OEMs are starting to figure out what sensors we want in a smartphone. Motion sensors and step counters are more standard now, while barometers and humidity sensors have tapered off.\nFragmentation is the gift and the curse of Android. It gives us all a lot of variety, but when is too much of a good thing just \u2014 too much?\n\u27a4 Android Fragmentation Visualized [Open Signal]\nRead next: There are 18,796 distinct Android devices, according to OpenSignal\u2019s latest fragmentation report\nRead next: Mapped: Londoners swearing about the city's transport strike\n}}

{{AMD has stated that they are willing to work on semi-custom chips that are capable of running Android or Chrome OS. AMD believes that a market is emerging for the operating systems and their CPUs or APUs could be perfect for the job.

{{Update: This post has been modified to include clarify the battery usage from my initial experience with the Nexus 5.\nBy now we all know that Google\u2019s not-so-secret Nexus 5 is for sale. We got our hands on a review unit and here are our initial impressions. Keep in mind that these are only first impressions after having used it for a few hours and so haven\u2019t completely taken it through the wringer, but we wanted to show you what you can expect for this $349 and $399 phone.\nThere\u2019s nothing that makes the packaging stand out among all of the other Nexus devices, but when you open up the box and take out the Nexus 5, this is where your new Nexus experience begins. At just 8.59 millimeters and weighing 4.8 ounces, the smartphone is extremely thin and light \u2014 it almost felt as though it could break while in your hands.\nThe 5-inch display makes it suitable to fit in the palm of your hands, but while carrying it in my pocket while walking through San Francisco, it sort of felt like it was out of place \u2014 perhaps I\u2019ve grown too accustomed to the fact that I\u2019ve had 3- to 4-inch phones for the past few years. Although you can hold the device in one hand, it doesn\u2019t immediately feel comfortable enough size to manage all your affairs as such. Trying to type out emails or using certain apps required the use of both hands.\nUsers will notice that the display is sharp, perhaps akin to Apple\u2019s Retina display. All the details of the icons and content on the phone are pretty clearly visible.\nLG is the company behind the Nexus 5. The construction appears to be pretty sturdy and it\u2019s quite easy to grip. However, the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen does make it prone to smudges and fingerprints and almost as soon as I took the phone out of the box and removed the screen covering, a fingerprint emerged.\nThe camera has 8.1 megapixels and comes with optical image stabilization. It takes some pretty good photographs which we\u2019ll be showing off later, including HDR and Photo Spheres. There\u2019s a single flash on the Nexus 5, which when enabled, will turn on as you try and focus on something in a darkened room. So if you plan on taking photos at a night club or in the evening, better warn people of two flashes.\nSo what about KitKat, Google\u2019s latest Android operating system? In my preliminary assessment, it\u2019s stable and useful. The fact that Google Now has been incorporated so well into the platform so that it\u2019s accessible from any of the home screen windows will hopefully help users find what they want quicker.\nIn a bit of a pet peeve, the phone will respond to anyone that says \u201cOK Google\u201d. It\u2019s interesting that KitKat hasn\u2019t incorporated the same preventative measure that Google has with its Glass product (it won\u2019t activate when random people walk by and scream \u201cOK Google\u201d into the device). Nevertheless, I found Google Now useful, especially when I asked it to open apps. Gmail and Flipboard opened instantly, though Instagram failed to open on cue. Why that happened is unknown, so a bit of tweaking could be done \u2014 it\u2019s still far from perfect.\nThe overall appearance of Android 4.4 is decent, but if you\u2019re expecting a remarkable overhaul from Jellybean, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. Although the aesthetics haven\u2019t changed that dramatically, the experience itself has. We\u2019ll dive deeper into this when we have an opportunity to do a more in-depth review of the Nexus 5.\nNexus 5 owners will also find that it includes the latest Hangouts app, which lets you to send SMS and MMS messages, along with Quickoffice, which enables you to open or create new documents, spreadsheets, and presentations \u2014 a potential rival to Microsoft Office.\nGoogle Wallet also comes installed on KitKat, which is needed in order to take advantage of the \u201cTap & pay\u201d feature.\nWhen I received the phone it had a fully charged battery. After seven hours, it still has 56 percent remaining after setting it up, installing apps, checking email, taking a few photos, and surfing the Web. Besides that, the rest of the power consumption was through the screen being on and also Google Search. However, as I begin to use it more with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and checking email, it will be interesting to see how well the battery stands up.\nPlastic cases are also available for the Nexus 5 and Google included a florescent orange\/pink one \u2014 it\u2019s noticeably bright so you won\u2019t miss it in a darkened environment. It\u2019s flimsy, but sturdy enough for those who want some added protection for their device without paying a lot for it.\nBased on the few hours we\u2019ve had to play with the Nexus 5, it\u2019s a solid-looking and flexible device that has the potential to help you get the information you want, make sure you arrive at your destination safely, and be a productivity workhorse. This device may be Google\u2019s effort to stand up against the likes of the iPhone 5s, the HTC One, or the Samsung Galaxy S4, but it might fall short of that aspiration. It\u2019s certainly offering some premium features, but at an affordable price point.\nSee related: Everything we currently know about Google\u2019s Android 4.4 KitKat\nRead next: Bubbli for iOS lets you create amazing 360-degree photospheres\n}}

{{Microsoft today announced a new initiative that combines under a single umbrella all of the company\u2019s gaming-related products for developers like Xbox Live, Azure PlayFab, Direct X, Mixer, Virtual Studio, Simplygon and Azure. That umbrella, Microsoft Game Stack, is meant to give game developers, no matter whether they are at a AAA studio or working solo, all the tools they need to develop and then operate their games across devices and platforms.\n\u201cGame Stack brings together our game development platforms, tools and services like Direct X and Visual Studio, Azure and Playfab into a robust ecosystem that any game developer can use,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, the corporate vice president for the Microsoft Gaming Cloud. \u201cWe view this as a journey that we are just beginning.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that developers can pick and choose which of the services they want to use. While Azure is part of Game Stack, for example, the overall stack is cloud and device agnostic. Undoubtedly, though, Microsoft hopes that developers will adopt Azure as their preferred cloud. These days, after all, most games feature some online component, even if they aren\u2019t multiplayer games, and developers need a place to store player credentials, telemetry data and other info.\nOne of the core components of Game Stack is PlayFab, a backend service for building cloud-connected games, which now falls under the Azure family. Microsoft acquired the service early last year and it\u2019s worth noting that it supports all major gaming platforms, ranging from the Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch to iOS, Android, PC and web.\nWith today\u2019s announcement, Microsoft is launching a number of new PlayFab services, too. These include PlayFab Matchmaking, a matchmaking service the company adapted from Xbox Live matchmaking, but that\u2019s now available to all developers and on all devices. This service is now in public preview. In private preview are PlayFab Party, a voice and chat service (also modeled after Xbox Party Chat), PlayFab Game insights for real-time game telemetry, PlayFab Pub Sub for pushing content updates, notifications and more to the game client, and PlayFab User Generated Content for allowing players to safely share content with each other.\nSo while Game Stack may feel more like a branding exercise, it\u2019s clear that PlayFab is where Microsoft is really putting its money as it\u2019s competing with Amazon and Google, both of which have recently put a lot of emphasis on game developers, too.\nIn addition to these announcements, Microsoft also today said that it is bringing an SDK for Xbox Live to iOS and Android devices so developers can integrate that service\u2019s identity and community services into their games on those platforms, too.\n}}

{{We were inevitably excited when Microsoft announced that its classic PC title Age of Empires would be coming to iOS and Android soon, but it seems that\u2019s the only plans that Microsoft has as far as porting games to mobile devices, other than the company\u2019s own products. Microsoft Studios boss Phil Spencer confirmed that the company has no plans past Age of Empires.\nSpencer confirmed via Twitter that the speculation of bringing Xbox games to mobile platforms was simply \u201ca translation error,\u201d and he says that the company is \u201cnot bringing Xbox games to non-MS devices.\u201d This isn\u2019t something that we wanted to hear, but it seems Microsoft is keeping Xbox games within their own ecosystem, which certainly seems like a smart move from the face of it.\nIt was rumored earlier this week from multiple reports that the Age of Empires move into the mobile sector was only Microsoft\u2019s first steps at releasing multiple Xbox and PC games on different mobile platforms. However, Microsoft has since debunked those rumors, but the word on Microsoft PC games coming to mobile is still out there.\nAge of Empires for iOS and Android is expected to make its debut at some point this year, and no release windows has been disclosed yet. The game will be free-to-play, but gamers will have the opportunity to make in-app purchases by buying more resources using real money in order to advance further along in the game at a much quicker pace.\nMicrosoft noted that Japanese smartphone game developing company Klab Inc. would be joining Microsoft as a collaborator to make the mobile version of Age of Empires possible, so the game will be through Klab and not Microsoft directly, but we can expect pretty much the same experience on iOS and Android as we did on the PC so many years ago.\n}}

{{Share\nLate last month, Google announced it was beginning a limited test for its new Android Instant Apps initiative, a platform that allows users to run software without installing it to their device. Now, the functionality has reportedly reached some Pixel and recent Nexus phones, according to 9to5Google and Reddit.\nIn typical Google fashion, not all supported devices running the most current versions of 7.0 Nougat are receiving Instant Apps immediately \u2014 the company appears to be rolling out the feature slowly, without notifying users. You can check if your phone is ready to start running Instant Apps by visiting the Google > Services submenu inside Settings. Eligible devices will have a toggle for Instant Apps, where the user can opt in.\nIf you\u2019re one of the chosen few, the method for finding Instant Apps is still a bit counter-intuitive in these early stages. Users have to search for them in Chrome, and currently there are only four known examples: Buzzfeed, Viki, Periscope, and Wish. With any luck, a search result near the top labeled \u201cInstant\u201d should appear, and you can follow that link to run the app.\nAt this point, not all of the apps are working in all cases, and 9to5Google says it is unclear which devices and versions of Android will receive the feature first. Google has stated it is targeting 4.1 Jelly Bean forward for the full release.\nGoogle is pitching Instant Apps as a solution to the problem of having to install an app you\u2019ll only use once, or just want to test-drive. Think of them as smaller, stripped-down versions of existing apps that disappear from the device the moment they are closed.\nWhen Google announced the initiative in May of last year, it said that about \u201chalf a dozen\u201d partners had agreed to embrace the format, including B&H Photo Video, Medium, Hotel Tonight, Zumper, Disney, and the aforementioned Buzzfeed. Instant Apps seem particularly beneficial for uncommon services, like hotel hunting, or impromptu shopping needs, so look forward to similar apps joining the list later on.\n}}

{{The guys at JooJoo\u2014you know, the tablet that was once made with TechCrunch but then had a falling out\u2014want you to know two things: They're still alive, and there's a new JooJoo coming next year.\nFirst, the new JooJoo. It's going to be based on Android, but not be Android, meaning it might not have access to the Android Marketplace. The guys tell me they're currently in talks, but from what I've heard in the past from Google, there's a very strict guideline as to how devices have to be constructed in order to get access to the Marketplace.\nBut, they say they're taking Android's brains and optimising it for what they think the tablet market needs now. One example they gave was taking all the different messaging services, like Gmail and Facebook messages and so forth, and unifying it into one interface.\nThey didn't go into many more details, but they did say that once the new device is out, they're no longer going to be making the old JooJoo. Supporting, yes, but making, no. Also, they said they're going to be a multiple-device company, and since they're discontinuing the old one, it makes sense that there will be more than one new device.\nAs for the legal stuff, well, they say it doesn't impact them on a day-to-day basis and they're churning forth and expanding their business to make the next JooJoo better. And they say that their sales are lower than expected, but that they're doing alright in Europe and Asia.\n}}

{{I\u2019ll skip the obvious \u201cacceleration\u201d puns and just say things are looking good for Appcelerator, maker of a cross-platform app development software.\nThe company announced today that it has raised $15 million in a third round of funding. It also revealed some stats demonstrating tremendous growth for its Titanium development platform, including the fact that it\u2019s now the largest third-party app publisher on both iOS and Android.\nAppcelerator says that the funding will be used to expand into Europe and Asia, as well as to help build up the Titanium platform.\nTitanium allows developers to easily create native and HTML 5 web apps for mobile, tablets, and desktops. And developers are clearly jumping on Appcelerator\u2019s platform: The company says it now has over 1.6 million developers in its ecosystem (many of which came from its acquisition of Aptana in January), over 30,000 apps published (a six-fold increase over last year), and its apps are on over 30 million devices. Appcelerator\u2019s employee numbers also skyrocketed, jumping to 100 from just 17 a year ago.\nThe company is also looking to support other platforms with its app development, including connected TVs by the end of the year, VP of marketing Scott Schwarzhoff told VentureBeat in an interview last week. NBC is apparently already asking the company about using its tools to develop a Google TV app, which shouldn\u2019t be too difficult since GTV is Android-based. As for Windows Phone 7, he said \u201cit wasn\u2019t a question of if, but when.\u201d\nThis latest funding round was led by Mayfield Fund, Translink Capital, and Red Hat.\nAppcelerator also snapped up the HTML 5 platform maker Particle Code last week \u2014 which was funded by this latest round \u2014 in an effort to ramp up its own HTML5 development offerings.\nThe third round of funding comes about a year after Appcelerator\u2019s last round of $9 million. The Mountain View, Calif-based company has now raised around $24 million to date.\n}}

{{The release of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich is not that far away, so we thought we would offer you an update of what we know so far. We will also take a look at a few videos explaining all the new features. Much has been promised with this latest version of Android\u2019s OS, so will it be able to live up to expectations, as well as offer improved app support?\nWhen Ice Cream Sandwich was first announced at Google I\/O we were lucky enough to be part of it thanks to a video being shot. The first that that you will notice is the logo, and shows that Google loves to play around with these logos, much like they do with their Google Doodle.\nThis is said to be their most ambition mobile OS release to date, the thing that consumer will love about this latest version is choice, something that you do not get with iOS and others on the market. The main focus with Ice Cream Sandwich is apps, and they will get the tools that they need in order to offer a much greater experience for the user.\nThe best thing about this next version of Android is how it will take all what was good from Honeycomb, and make it available in not just tablets but other devices as well. So the next big Android handset release will soon come with a holographic UI, new launcher, multitasking UI, advanced applications and so much more.\nWe do not have a release date yet for Ice Cream Sandwich, but it should be with us by Q4. In this second video there is no talking, but you all know about the idea that pictures speak louder than words? Well that is the case here, and once you watch the video you will know just what we mean.\nOther features that will be updated include the camera software, which will now feature software to track your face, which is something that Nokia has been doing for sometime now. Although Google tell us that Ice Cream Sandwich will be for all Android devices, we do not think that they are being entirely clear here. We say this because it could demand a processor to run at a higher speed than some older handsets can manage. At least we know that the big players will be fine, such as the HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Galaxy S II+, and the Droid Bionic to name a few.\nThe final video that we have for you is for the entire Google I\/O keynote for day one, so not only will you get an insight into this next Android OS, but some of the other products that Google have to offer. Funny how there was no mention of Google+.\n}}

{{SEOUL (Reuters) - Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday it will launch a mobile web payments service for all smartphones powered by Google Inc's Android mobile operating system in South Korea in the first quarter. The service, called Samsung Pay Mini, will allow Android smartphones to make online transactions in Samsung's home country after downloading a dedicated app. The company did not comment on whether the service will be offered in other markets. The announcement comes as Samsung seeks to boost its services offerings in a search for new growth. In October-December, the South Korean firm fell behind archrival Apple Inc in the global smartphone market for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015, hurt by the demise of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphones.

The platform's rivals include Google's Android Pay and Apple's Apple Pay. Samsung executives have previously said they were open to offering Samsung Pay services for non-Galaxy smartphones at some point and planned to eventually add online transactions to the mobile payments platform. The offline capability will remain limited to Samsung devices, the company said on Thursday. The company does not currently make money from Samsung Pay users' transactions but hopes the convenience of the service will drive users to Samsung products.

{{Google\u2019s Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update for the Nexus S hit a snag today, as Electronista reports that the company posted on its forums that it was holding the operating system update to \u201cmonitor feedback\u201d, after users saw atypically high battery drain on the devices. Possibly induced by a spike in processor usage, the issue wasn\u2019t enough to halt all updates worldwide, but the upgrade \u201cwouldn\u2019t return until Google was satisfied there wasn\u2019t an issue.\u201d\nThe problem may possibly be related to a recent update to Android 4.0. Galaxy Nexus owners have mentioned throughout Google\u2019s online forums that they\u2019ve seen battery drain issues akin to that of the Nexus S. However, in their cases, it may be that the kernel behind the low-level software on the device is artificially keeping the device awake even when the screen itself is off, depleting battery far faster than it typically would.\nGoogle hasn\u2019t issued an official acknowledgment of the Galaxy Nexus battery issue, although it hasn\u2019t pushed Ice Cream Sandwich versin 4.0.3 update to those devices yet. We\u2019ll keep you updated what happens next, whether from Google, or others. Hopefully the issue gets resolved in the time being, though. Let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed.\n[via Electronista]\n}}

{{Nearly half of shoppers who considered buying an iPhone but eventually bought an Android smart phone did so because they wanted to stick with their network operator, an internal Apple survey claims.\nThe survey, which lists reasons why people who considered an iPhone eventually went for Android, is another document that's come to light thanks to the legal spat currently raging between Apple and Samsung, and was published in January last year, the Verge reports.\nBefore we don our analysis hats, the number of people polled isn't given, so it's wise to take these stats with a pinch of salt. Update: an eagle-eyed Tweeter spotted that the graphic above features 'n=89', suggesting the poll involved 89 people, which isn't a particularly large sample size.\nThose disclaimers dispensed, 48 per cent of people in the survey checked the 'Wanted to stay with current wireless service provider' box as a factor that influenced their buying decision.\nThat would suggest that a chunk of the Android-owning public line their pockets with Google's mobile operating system because they want to stick with a network, rather than because they crave a particular Android mobile.\nThat's not quite the whole picture however, as 36 per cent of those who considered an iPhone but eventually opted for Android listed trusting the Google brand as a reason for doing so.\nThat feels like a healthy amount to me, or at the very least it suggests that shoppers associate the Android operating system with Google, which I suspect hasn't always been clear to those who don't hang out with geeks live their lives on the technological frontier.\nAnother factor is that the survey took place while the iPhone was still exclusive to operator AT&T in the US, which meant that any shoppers that didn't want to switch to that network would need to opt for a non-Apple smart phone.\n30 per cent of those polled said they chose Android because they preferred a bigger screen -- something that Android has certainly capitalised on in the last year, with gadgets like the Samsung Galaxy S3 and HTC One X bumping up display real-estate averages. 25 per cent said they ultimately went Android because they 'wanted the latest technology'.\nResults aside, the survey also proves that Apple -- which gives the appearance of being totally aloof when it comes to its rivals -- is in fact keeping a weather eye on the competition.\nDo you have an Android phone? Why did you choose it? Tell me in the comments or on our Facebook wall.\n}}

{{Although it\u2019s well known across Asia for its excellent smartphones, Xiaomi\u2019s presence in the US has been minimal, with only accessories like headphones available for sale since it opened its online store there last May.\nBut at Google I\/O 2016, the Chinese hardware maker had a surprise for the American market: a 4K-ready Android TV-based set-top box for all your video streaming and gaming needs. The company says that, unlike all its other products, it will first launch in the US.\nXiaomi says its Mi Box will be capable of running 4K UHD video at 60fps and supporting HDR10, a standard for high dynamic range playback that promises better contrast and color. YouTube, Netflix and Amazon have already announced that their streaming platforms will support it soon.\nThe Mi Box comes with a Bluetooth remote control capable of voice search and game control\nUnder the hood is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali 450 GPU, paired with 2GB RAM and 8GB of onboard storage. You can also plug in USB drives to increase space. As for audio, the Mi Box supports Dolby Digital Plus and DTS Surround Sound, which promise a cinema-like listening experience at home.\nAs with other Android TV boxes, you can control the device with its accompanying Bluetooth remote control that supports voice search and game control. The company will also sell a console-style Mi Game Controller separately.\nThe Mi Game Controller will be sold separately and work with the Mi Box as well as other Android devices\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if Xiaomi can make a name for itself in the US with an Android TV-based device. The company has been known to deliver high-quality products at reasonable prices in markets like India and China.\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t seem like Xiaomi wants to get into the streaming content business in the US, as it does in its home market. In China, its set-top boxes work with the company\u2019s own streaming service that offers a range of locally produced shows and movies.\nAt present, it doesn\u2019t have a lot of competition to worry about \u2013 only a handful of brands like Google\u2019s own Nexus label, Sony, Sharp, Razer and Nvidia currently offer Android TV-based devices. With clever pricing, the Chinese firm could well rule this roost once it launches.\nXiaomi hasn\u2019t yet confirmed availability and pricing for the Mi Box in the US.\n}}

{{At 438.1 million units shipped, there was no growth in the total phone market year over year. However, the smartphone market grew by 37%, comprising almost 50% of all phones. Android phones made up 34% of total phone shipments, while iOS phones accounted for only 11%. Within the smartphone market, Android handsets made up 69% of the 216.5 million total.\nAmong smartphone hardware manufacturers, Samsung topped the competition, shipping 74 million more handsets than Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 101 million. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) remained No. 3 with 35 million units. For the first time, Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE took third and fourth place, respectively. Meanwhile, Sony (NYSE:SNE) fell out of the top five, while Lenovo moved in by shipping 9.5 million units.\nThe Chinese companies saw their shipments increase because of demand in their home markets and growing exposure to the United States. On the back of Chinese demand, Lenovo grew 216%, accounting for 98% of the company's shipments. Still, as analyst Jessica Kwee said, Lenovo struggles \"to gain a foothold outside China and may be forced down the acquisition route -- as it was with its PC business -- hence the speculation\" about a move from BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).\n}}

{{Those of you who enjoy playing casino games on mobile may have noticed that a new app is currently storming to the top of the Android download charts. That app is called Cleopatra Casino free slots but we have discovered that some users are having installation problems with the app.\nThese free slots apps can get incredibly addictive, especially when developers give you free credits to try and tempt you to keep playing long enough so that you eventually part with real cash to play.\nThis formula is indeed evident in this latest slot app, but it appears that some of you have been having problems getting the app to actually start.\nThe Galaxy Note 3 in particular appears to be one device that is prone to this issue, resulting in one error message that states \u201cunfortunately Cleopatra has stopped, please try again.\u201d\nWe have also seen that there is a second problem with the app, relating to a coins notification error which causes a freeze and the app also unable to work.\nAs far as we\u2019re aware, this isn\u2019t affecting everyone so it\u2019s not a widespread problem. An update may be needed though to improve stability as it looks like the initial launch has come with some bugs.\nHave you been having problems at all when trying to install the new Cleopatra Casino app on Android?\n}}

{{Since its introduction on May 29, Samsung has sold 10 million Galaxy S III smartphones with no sign of stopping, according to comments made by a company official over the weekend. The flagship phone offers a solid combination of hardware and custom software atop Google\u2019s(s goog) mobile platform. Although Google activates a million Android phones per day, the Galaxy S III could now account for a significant percentage.\nThe 10 million sales threshold follows earlier reports of the phone smashing pre-order records at Vodafone(s vod) and the fact that the company says it can only make 5 million Galaxy S III phones per month. Aside from the potent hardware and tweaked software, what else is helping sales? Two things: Samsung offers only a single model with a few carrier tweaks and different memory options, plus it launched in multiple smartphone-centric regions around the world such as Europe and the U.S.\nThis strategy of one phone to \u201crule them all\u201d started with the first Galaxy handset in 2010 and followed with its successor, the Galaxy S II, last year. But it took 5 months for the latter to cross the 10 million sales mark as compared to the less than 2 months for the current model. And Samsung\u2019s new phone is becoming more of a standout than any other of the many different Android handsets.\nThe current sales number equates to around 190,000 Galaxy S III sales per day since the phone launched. With respect to the one million Android phones that Google activates daily, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S III looks to be a large percentage of overall Androids being sold currently. The figures aren\u2019t an exact apples to apples comparison, of course: Activations are phones in the hands of consumers while sales could mean orders delivered to operators and carriers.\nStill, the sales figure is staggering when compared to the Android market as a whole. That\u2019s relevant in the long-running Android vs. iOS debate, mainly because iOS sales are solely from one handset maker: Apple. Overall Android sales are a combination of sales from the dozens of device makers using Android for smartphones.\nLook at the last two years of handset sales by manufacturer, however \u2014 Asymco has a nice graph here \u2014 and you\u2019ll see that Samsung has seemingly come from nowhere to now be the top seller of Android devices. And the Galaxy S III looks to continue the trend, if not widen Samsung\u2019s lead as it becomes the face of Android while HTC, LG, Motorola and others struggle to differentiate themselves.\n}}

{{We\u2019ve already seen Pantech seemingly confirm an Android 4.4 KitKat update for its Vega Iron smartphone and now, it looks like another company may have spilled the beans extremely early as LG France looks to have hinted at an LG Optimus G Android 4.4 KitKat update in the future.\nBack in September, Google announced the Android 4.4 KitKat update, an update that will apparently be touching down at some point in October. Nestle, Google\u2019s Android 4.4 partner, seemingly confirmed it last month and rumors have all pointed to the software rolling out sometime within the confines of this month. Surprisingly, we\u2019re seeing a bunch of chatter when it comes to updates for devices, something that doesn\u2019t always happen ahead of an announcement.\nFirst, we saw the Nexus 7, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 Android 4.4 updates all but confirmed through bug logs. These updates are academic as they are all relatively new and Google typically gives Nexus devices several years of support. Next, we saw Pantech surprisingly confirm Android 4.4 KitKat for the Vega Iron, a device that arrived earlier this year in Asia. We\u2019ve also heard a bit of chatter about Android 4.4 updates for HTC devices with rumors suggesting that the HTC One X and HTC One X+ won\u2019t get the software.\nNow, it\u2019s an LG device that is seeing information emerge as the LG Optimus G is now in the spotlight thanks to comments made by LG France. In a thread on Reddit, a user relays his conversation with LG France\u2019s Facebook account. In the conversation, he asks if the LG Optimus G will be getting an update to Android 4.4. Surprisingly, he got this in response:\nHello, An update to the Android version 4.4 is scheduled for October current. You can find them on the website of your manufacturer. good day\nThis response seemingly backed up an FRAndroid report that claimed that the LG Optimus G would be getting the software update in October. That\u2019s because that site was given the same report. Not satisfied with the response, he approached the account again, asking for more clarity. When asked if they were saying that the Android 4.4 KitKat update would hit the LG Optimus G this month, the account replied \u201cExactly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the second response that fuels this rumor as he clearly asks if it\u2019s Android 4.4 and the representative says yes. Still, there are a few reasons that this \u201cconfirmation\u201d is dubious.\nOne, the LG Optimus G is still on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean in the United States and elsewhere. It would be a little strange to see it jump from Android 4.1 to Android 4.4 in October. Second, operators of social media accounts, often provide bad information. And third, LG is typically not in the front of the pack when it comes to Android update speed. It generally lags behind companies like HTC and Samsung. And four, Nexus devices typically see the update first and non-Nexus devices get software months later. Android 4.4 KitKat is supposedly coming out in October so it would be strange to see a non-Nexus get it so soon.\nWe have seen companies skip major Android updates for others, the HTC One skipped Android 4.2 in the U.S. and we\u2019ve heard that Android 4.4 could come to older devices. So at this point, anything is possible. We\u2019ve reached out to LG for comment but haven\u2019t heard anything and don\u2019t expect to. At this point though, take this rumor with an extreme grain of salt because we highly doubt that the LG Optimus G is going to get Android 4.4 KitKat in October, despite what an official LG Facebook account might be saying.\n}}

{{Share\nCheck out our review of the Panasonic ToughPad FZ-G1 tablet.\nCES may get its reputation for being all about the common man, hence the consumer part of the Consumer Electronic Show name, but that doesn\u2019t stop companies like Panasonic from using the opportunity to showcase their latest corporate and enterprise products. On Tuesday, Panasonic unleashed two more tablets into their Toughpad line of immortal electronics, one of which is a 10-inch device featuring Windows 8, and the other is a 7-inch featuring Android. The two compliment their recent launch of a 10-inch Android Toughbook late last year.\nThe first one, above and on the left, is the Toughpad JT-B1, a 7-inch Android tablet running Ice Cream Sandwich (version 4.0.) With a 1.5Ghz dual-core TI OMAP processor, 1 GB of RAM, and 16GB of space, you certainly get plenty of backend hardware for the WSVGA, daylight-readable display. Some interesting hardware also includes an impressive 13-megapixel camera with flash on the back, 1.3-megapixel camera on the front, 5,720mAh user-serviceable battery with 8 hours of life, and optional LTE. The unit comes with a 5-foot drop rating, IP65 rating for dust and water, and operates anywhere from 14 to 122 degrees. Where you choose to read books with this tablet is up to you, but there\u2019s a good chance that it will have a better chance of surviving than you will.\nThe second new model, in the picture above on the right, is the first Windows 8 tablet by Panasonic, and is the 10.1-inch Toughpad FZ-G1. Featuring a 3rd generation Intel Core i5 processor, up to 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, you\u2019re sure to have plenty of computing power wherever you may go with this Toughpad. It also features a 10.1-inch sunlight-readable display with active digitizer (really just a stylus,) 8 hour battery life, USB 3.0, HDMI, GPS, and also LTE. The FZ-G1 in particular can withstand 4-foot drops, has an IP65 rating for rain and dust, and can operate anywhere from 14 to 122 degrees. As you have probably guessed, it\u2019ll survive anything from construction sites to your three-year-old nephew.\nPanasonic has introduced some impressive devices, and these two complete the trinity of Toughpads for those looking for Windows 8 or Android. Sadly there has yet to be any announced pricing, but Panasonic says they\u2019re now available for order, so feel free to drop them a line. You can also watch the video below that they sent us showcasing the tablet trio. No word on Jelly Bean updates for either of the Android tablets.\n}}

{{Share\nOffice suites for Android and iOS are plentiful thanks to Microsoft Office\u2019s absence from these two popular mobile platforms. However, of the dozens that come up in search, only a handful approach Office\u2019s robustness in features and functionality. And of those, almost every one is missing a key feature or two. It might be something as simple as not displaying word count, as crucial as an inability to render and save formatting correctly, or as complex as working with Word\u2019s Track Changes, but big players like Quick Office, DocumentsToGo, iWork, and Google Drive all fall short in some key area, leaving people waiting for Microsoft to get its act together (you still have a long wait ahead of you if the rumors are true).\nBut wait, there\u2019s hope! Last year SoftMaker released Office 2012 Mobile for Android after more than a year in beta. The folks at SoftMaker are experts at mobile office suites since they\u2019ve been at it since the Windows Mobile days. It shows in the Android version, making the wait well worth it. One major roadblock: the price.\n$30 is steep for an app, even if the bundle includes all three: TextMaker word processor, PlanMaker spreadsheet, and Presentations. Most people will only want and need one of them: TextMaker. Wish granted. SoftMaker has quietly released the apps on the Google Play Store, allowing customers to buy them separately. Even better: they each cost just $5. That made it worth it for us to take a closer look at TextMaker to see if it lives up to the company\u2019s lofty claims.\nHow It Works\nUpon opening the app, TextMaker drops you right into a new document instead of presenting you with landing area. This can be a little disconcerting, especially if you\u2019ve never used the app before \u2013 we like the way QuickOffice and DocsToGo give you a few options upon opening. Aside from accessing documents stored on the tablet or phone, TextMaker can also connect to DropBox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, and Evernote. QuickOffice has a wider selection of cloud service connections, but TextMaker hits the big ones.\nThe app\u2019s layout is very clean and simple and familiar to anyone who has ever used an office suite, mobile or not. A toolbar on the bottom features icons, not text, for all the typical menu items: File, Edit, View, Format, Tools, etc. Each of these menus is available from the Menu button if the meaning of the icons isn\u2019t apparent. A second level toolbar appears when there are more options, and everything is arranged in a clean and familiar way so it\u2019s easy to find what you\u2019re looking for. The number of options is pretty vast and could become confusing if not arranged well. Thankfully, an extensive Help file is available at a tap and is accessible offline. Other than the two toolbars, the rest of the screen is given over to the document itself.\nTextMaker won\u2019t crowd the screen with the keyboard unless you tap the icon to bring it up. We appreciate this since we mostly used a Bluetooth keyboard when working on documents and it was nice not to have to dismiss the on-screen one every time. It\u2019s also nice that the app looks and works the same whether on a tablet or a smartphone screen. Since the controls take up a minimal amount of screen real estate to begin with, it\u2019s comfortable to work even on displays as \u201csmall\u201d as 4 inches.\nAnother nod to small-screen usefulness in the Wrap Text mode. The default view shows the whole page, margins and all. Wrap Text fits the text to the screen and eliminates the margins, creating a continuous scroll of content. This does not affect the formatting of the document itself. We found this useful even on tablets when we wanted to read and edit but not worry about formatting or making the text large enough to read comfortably.\nTextMaker\u2019s most prominent claim is that it will preserve all document formatting, be it on the text or paragraph level to images, text boxes, and other objects. In our testing, we found this to be true. We tried documents with a variety of applied styles, and pictures, drop caps, and tables. The only element that didn\u2019t display exactly is fonts, and this isn\u2019t a problem unique to Android. TextMaker does give you the option to add fonts if common ones are missing. Everything else rendered the same as on a computer.\nOne feature that will make this app invaluable to professionals and students is its ability to work with MS Word\u2019s Track Changes. A few other office suites allow you to see changes and\/or comments, but TextMaker gives you full functionality. You can see changes, record, accept\/reject, and jump from one to the next, plus view, edit, and add comments. The process is very similar to how it works in Word, so anyone familiar with that program will have no problem in this app.\nPros\nRobust features: This is one of the most robust office suite apps we\u2019ve ever come across for mobile devices. The features and functionality are far above every other app yet the interface doesn\u2019t feel bloated, crowded, or confusing.\nThis is one of the most robust office suite apps we\u2019ve ever come across for mobile devices.

{{Share\nSony has begun rolling out its \u201cmy Xperia\u201d mobile security service around the globe. Exclusive to the company\u2019s Xperia range of Android phones, it offers similar functionality to Apple\u2019s \u201cFind my iPhone\u201d feature, letting users track, lock and wipe an Xperia handset should it become lost or stolen.\nTrialled in a limited beta back in February, the my Xperia service offers plenty of options for hunting down or protecting a lost phone. For instance, if you\u2019ve innocently lost your handset somewhere at home, but have left it on silent, you\u2019ll be able to log into a web interface at myxperia.sonymobile.com and trigger an alarm remotely at the handset\u2019s full volume to help you track it down, regardless of the sound profile or volume settings set on the handset itself.\nThe web interface will also offer precision mapping data sent by the phone\u2019s GPS, letting you pinpoint the handset\u2019s last known location, and sending users an email if a handset that has gone off the grid once again begins transmitting location data.\nAs well as giving the option to remotely alter pin details, users will also be able to send a message to the lockscreen of the missing handset (perhaps offering a reward for its safe return), as well as a final last resort option of clearing all data on the handset if you fear it\u2019s fallen irreversibly into the wrong hands.\nIt\u2019s a nice move from Sony\u2019s team, considering the reams of sensitive data we hold on our phones, and the fact that there is no native way to secure a lost phone on the Android operating system. HTC\u2019s Sense Online service previously offered similar functionality to users of their Android phones, too.\nThose using a handset from a different manufacturer should check out the Lookout security app, which we\u2019ve featured in the past, which offers much of the functionality of the security services mentioned here for Android handsets regardless of manufacturer.\nShare this: Email\nFacebook\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nReddit\nTwitter\nTumblr\nPocket\nLike this: Like Loading...\n}}

{{After some initial confusion, the HTC One X+ Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and Sense 5 update is indeed rollingl out in Asia and a noted leakster says that it will touch down in Europe at some soon.\nWhile much of the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and Sense 5 speculation has been hovering over the HTC One X and the HTC One S, the latter of which had its updates cancelled by HTC, it appears that the HTC One X+ has flown in under the radar and the device is currently getting Android 4.2 and Sense 5 in Taiwan.The update, and it\u2019s full list of features, is live on HTC\u2019s website,\nRead: HTC One X Android 4.2 Update Release Pegged for August.\nIn particular, HTC One X+ users in Taiwan are getting the update first, something that falls in line with HTC\u2019s previous updates which have hit Taiwan first and then have moved on to other regions of the world.\n@abishekpatel Maybe this week, but probably next week\u2026 \u2014 LlabTooFeR (@LlabTooFeR) August 8, 2013\nIt\u2019s unclear when this particular update might branch off but according to the well-sourced @LlabTooFeR, it could come to Europe as soon as next week or as late as next week. So it doesn\u2019t appear as though HTC One X+ owners outside Asia won\u2019t have long to wait.\nThat doesn\u2019t apply to HTC One X+ owners on AT&T as AT&T has been notoriously slow at updating HTC\u2019s devices with the HTC One X Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update coming months after the first update rolled out in Taiwan. AT&T has yet to confirm anything in regards to the update though owners will want to start tempering their expectations when it comes to timing.\nHTC\u2019s One X+ update brings both Android 4.2 and Sense 5, an upgrade over Android 4.1 and Sense 4+ which were running on the device in previous months. The software not only brings enhancements on the Android side of things but on the Sense side of things as well as Sense 5 offers a brand new look and some brand new features like HTC BlinkFeed.\nNow that the HTC One X+ has received the update, the next in line should be the HTC One X and the HTC One XL which have been rumored to be getting updates in the coming weeks.\n}}

{{Fujitsu had a prototype Tegra 3 Android smartphone safely hidden behind a glass wall at CES in Las Vegas, but here in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress we were able to get up close and personal with it. This new waterproof quad-core powered prototype smartphone was out in public and all they are calling it is \u201cquad-core prototype\u201d until further notice. More details and video below.\nWith Fujitsu saying the device is still months away from production and slated for a late 2012 launch we were happy to at least get some time with it. While the hardware felt a little loosely designed this early on it\u2019s to hard to judge. The quad-core Tegra 3 under the hood is impressive with this prototype device but that is only one small part of what makes it so unique. Fujitsu\u2019s also outfitted the phone with many top end specs to make an overall premiere device.\nAlong with everything else from Fujitsu this phone is both dustproof and waterproof. To make things better we have a 4.6\u2033 high resolution display but the exact specifications weren\u2019t available. It was extremely crisp and clear as you can see from our video experience below \u2014 although unresponsive at times.\nTo top things off we have a 13.1 megapixel camera on the rear and an optional fingerprint scanner too \u2014 similar to the Motorola Atrix. This sensor doubles as a proximity sensor and will automatically turn off the display when you set the device on the table. As usual the NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor was blazing fast and Fujitsu had a few on demo displaying some HD Tegra games using HDMI mirror to the big screen. The performance of the device was extremely stable and quick running on the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS, even for a early prototype device.\nAlthough Fujitsu is only calling this a prototype for now under the settings tab it was labeled the F12arc so we\u2019ll be sure to look for more information soon. Overall this quad-core prototype phone definetaly had its strong points and its weak ones. With the hardware needing some minor touch-ups this will be a quality top-end phone to round off the Fujitsu lineup. We look forward to seeing more later this year.\n[vms 9b8153e0047536c9f541]\n}}

{{Oracle (s orcl) today filed a complaint for patent and copyright infringement against Google (s goog) over some of the Java code used in Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system. At first glance, suit,which accuses Google of infringing seven patents as well as violating copyright, seems like both a Larry Ellison-style provocation against Google while it\u2019s reeling from the network neutrality fight and leaked memos on privacy, and the coming true of developers\u2019 worst fears following Oracle\u2019s purchase of Sun, the creator of Java. Oracle\u2019s terse press release on the suit says:\nIn developing Android, Google knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle\u2019s Java-related intellectual property. This lawsuit seeks appropriate remedies for their infringement.\nGiven that Android\u2019s been on the market as open-source code since 2007, and Oracle has owned Sun since January, it\u2019s unclear why the suit is being filed now, but perhaps the fact that Google is seeing 200,000 Android devices activated every day has something to do with it. However, if Oracle\u2019s really going after everyone using Java, things could get really hairy in the world of mobile phones and enterprise software \u2014 after all, Java is the underpinning for a lot of applications, as Oracle undoubtedly knows. Neither Oracle nor Google returned requests for comment.\nAnd since Oracle asks in its complaint not only for treble damages (basically what you ask for when you\u2019re sure folks have knowingly infringed on your patents, of which there are seven in this particular case) and demands that all infringing copies of its software or means of reproducing the software be \u201cimpounded and destroyed, or otherwise reasonably disposed of,\u201d folks had better keep their Motorola (s MOT) Droids and HTC Evos close at hand. The full complaint is below. Share and enjoy.\nFINAL Complaint\nImage courtesy of Flickr user Nosha\n}}

{{Some might not be convinced that Samsung\u2019s curved edge screens are anything but a gimmick, but there is one thing the design did bring to the table: Samsung Edge. The always accessible hidden panel gives users the ability to access functions and apps from any screen at any time. Presuming, of course, you own one of the latest and expensive Samsung flagship phones. Not anymore, thanks to this alternative Edge Screen app that delivers the same functionality without the burden of using a Galaxy.\nTruth be told, this isn\u2019t the first of its kind and will probably not be the last either. Few side panel apps, however, can boast of being beautiful, easy to use, and powerful all at the same time. Plus it comes with a recommendation from XDA, too.\nEdge Screen does the same things that Samsung Edge offers and then some. You have screens for shortcuts to favorite contacts and apps, calendar, and quick toggles. But it also adds screens you won\u2019t get from the built-in Samsung version, like a music player, soft (navigation) keys, and even a file manager.\nEdge Screen also offers the customization options that Samsung doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s free and, best of all, doesn\u2019t require anything other than Android 5.0 Lollipop. Of course, you\u2019ll have to grant specific screens permissions but developer and XDA Senior Member alticode promises those are just for enabling the features. No user tracking involved.\nOne current disadvantage of Edge Screen over Samsung Edge is the lack of a third-party ecosystem. Not that Samsung has a large one anyway. Given its infancy, that could come later on but, at least for now, Edge Screen is not only functional, it\u2019s also universal.\n}}

{{The BBC is to introduce a dedicated version of its BBC iPlayer application for kids in 2016.\nNot to be confused with the previously talked about iPlay service, BBC iPlayer for Children will be a dedicated app for iPad and Android tablets that strips away content that is deemed inappropriate for a young user's age range, while making it easier for them to find the CBBC and CBeebies shows they most like.\n\"It will be their very own BBC iPlayer app making it easy and fun for children to find their favourite CBBC and CBeebies shows and discover new BBC programmes in a safe environment that\u2019s designed just for them,\" said director of BBC Children, Alice Webb.\n\"Parents can also be confident that the app only contains content suitable for children. So, whether it\u2019s in the back of the car on a long journey with a tablet or on the bus to school on a mobile, kids will be able to watch their favour shows wherever they are, whenever they want to.\"\nThe BBC has also revealed that there were over 500 million downloads of children's content on the full version of iPlayer in the first six months of 2015. And that 25 per cent of children come to CBBC via the on demand service.\nAnd considering that over half of the UK's kids use mobiles and tablets now, there has never been a better time to give them their own iPlayer app.\nThe BBC is also working on the iPlay service previously announced, which will much more than streamed video. Webb described it as \"a single, online front-door for children to the wealth of the whole BBC and trusted partners beyond.\"\nIt will feature content from a range of platforms, including web, games, audio and film clips. And it will be entirely add-free.\niPlay will also feature digitally-delivered kids-content based on popular adult BBC shows, including Great British Bake Off and Match of the Day.\nThere is currently no indication as to when it might be available.\n}}

{{Andy Rubin, better known as the guy who created Android and then sold it to Google only to later leave, will finally show off his new smartphone on May 30.\nRubin's company, Essential, sent its first tweet on Thursday teasing the phone launch and then a follow-up tweet showing a silhouette of the device.\nBut what is that thing poking out of the top?!\nBefore we try to make some sense of it, here's the picture Essential shared:\nWe heard you @renan_batista - here's something to hold you over until next week: pic.twitter.com\/QSIeXyjKNq \u2014 Essential (@essential) May 25, 2017\nIt kinda looks like one of those fat antennas on an old Palm Treo. There's definitely a wave of interest for retro phones this year, but we doubt Rubin's new phone is a blast back to the eyesore antenna days.\nTo see if I could get more details, I opened the image in Photoshop and cranked up the exposure, and... well, well, well, what do we have here?\nWe enhanced the silhouette. That thing sticking out looks like a camera attachment. Image: Essential\/mashable enhancement\nIt sure looks like that's a camera on top. One of my coworkers says it looks like an PC webcam from the '90s, and I have to agree.\nAnd if it is a camera (likely an attachment), what type of camera is it? A super-charged selfie camera? My guess is some kind of 360-degree camera, if only because Rubin tweeted this picture showing 360 footage in April:\nCan anyone guess what my colleague Wei is working on? First correct guess wins a signed version of the product when it's ready! pic.twitter.com\/RjGLczdCgV \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) April 12, 2017\nNeedless to say, as the guy who brought us Android, all eyes are on Rubin's first real mobile hardware.\nThough we'll have to wait until next week to see the phone proper, we know a few things about it.\nOne, it'll have a screen that runs edge-to-edge on at least three sides (top, left, and right) like the Xiaomi Mi Mix:\nI'm really excited about how this is shaping up. Eager to get it in more people's hands... pic.twitter.com\/LRzQCFSKTm \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) March 27, 2017\nTwo, it'll run Android, as confirmed by Google chairman Eric Schmidt:\nPhenomenal new choices for Android users coming very soon.

Motorola is the only other company that's got \"modular\" phones with a magnetic connector for adding on accessories (Moto Mods).\nFive, it'll likely have some kind of advanced AI built into it, because AI is the future and every tech company, from Apple to Amazon to Microsoft to Google is betting on it to make our lives more convenient.\nAnd six, it'll probably cost as much as an iPhone. So if you're hoping for cheap, don't bet on it.\nEnjoy the next few days while you can because when Tuesday rolls around, the world of phones and Android could be completely transformed.\n}}

{{With the release of Android 7.0 Nougat by Google, it's now the turn of all the manufacturers to get to work on versions of the software for their own phones.\nHTC has taken to Twitter to confirm that the final software has been released to them by Google, meaning that this conversion and compatibility work can start.\nFor those who don't remember, HTC has a 90-day guarantee. This is the timeframe in which the company aims to get the new version of the software onto its flagship device, in this case the HTC 10.\nHTC has something of a mixed record with this, with some unlocked versions getting the update close to that timeframe, others slipping because of factors beyond HTC's control \u2013 especially when carrier\/network testing gets involved for locked devices.\nWe\u2019re excited to receive final shipping Android 7.0 Nougat software from Google! pic.twitter.com\/BNbQBpgddK \u2014 HTC (@htc) August 24, 2016\nHTC hasn't committed to a specific date, just that it is aiming for Q4 for the Android Nougat update on HTC 10, HTC One M9 and HTC One A9. Currently, no other devices have been mentioned, but we suspect that's because they will follow later.\nFor those who don't remember, the HTC One A9 launched almost with vanilla Android Marshmallow in 2015. The HTC 10 followed suit, with HTC saying it was moving closer to Android, the aim being less bloat, plus offering the advantage of being able to update quickly.\nNow that Android Nougat has dropped, it's time to see if that holds true and if HTC's purer software will see it updated before its rivals.\n}}

{{Today at the annual Google I\/O developer conference, we learned about all the updates coming to the latest version of Google's mobile operating system, dubbed Android O for now \u2014 at least until its official release later this year. This is the eighth version of the OS (Android 8.0), and even though we've seen some of the additions in the developer preview that launched in March, there's a whole swath of new goodies that Google highlighted at the show. So, without further adieu, here are all the new updates coming to Android.\nThe Basics\nEager fans will be happy to know that the Android O beta is being made publicly available for download today. The build is still unstable given that it isn't an official release, so we'd recommend against installing it on your primary device if you choose to start testing it out immediately.\nMost of the updates coming to Android involve little tweaks to the operating system that make it perform better and easier to control. One of the easiest places to see these changes is in the completely overhauled Settings app. The new version of Android has fewer top-level options (making it easier to navigate) and slightly tweaked interfaces for things like battery usage. This should help combat the criticism that Android has too many menus and is difficult to navigate.\nOne of the other major updates is the addition of picture-in-picture (PIP) mode. The new PIP mode lets users continue watching a video in the corner of the screen while simultaneously running another app. So, for example, you can watch a YouTube video while you're also writing an email, sending a text message, or taking notes The feature works similar to Samsung's multi-window support on newer Galaxy devices, but Google's version also lets users resize the window like they would on a normal desktop computer.\nAndroid O also makes notifications way better. This starts with Notification Dots that show up as a tiny dot on an app icon as alerts roll in. The cool thing about these new notifications is that you can long-press a Notification Dot and see the alert right from the home screen. You don't actually have to launch the app or pull down the notifications menu from the top of the screen.\nIn addition to dots, Android O adds Notification Channels that make it easier to sort through notifications of a specific type. For example, you could set up a channel to receive notifications for technology news only, so that you're not bombarded with political news all day long. Or you could bundle all of your Gmail notifications together, so that your lock screen isn't popping off with every little message you receive.\nOther tweaks include adaptive icons that will help the operating system look more uniform across devices, WiFi Aware that lets you transfer files over a Wi-Fi connection without the need for an internet connection, and Autofill APIs that will let you quickly type in information like addresses and phone numbers (similar to what's already available on Chrome).\nThat brings us to the biggest (and least visible) update of them all. Android O will now include background execution limits that essentially limit what apps can do in the background to save battery life on your device. Google previously adjusted some of these limits in Android N, but the company is going a step further in this new update to squeeze more life out of Android phones. Altogether, these updates should make using an Android phone better and easier to personalise.\nAndroid security enhancements\nGoogle announced Google Play Protect, a service that's available on every Android O device out of the box. It scans your device on a regular basis in addition to scanning every app you decide to install to protect against malware.\nGoogle's director of product management at Android, Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson, said during the keynote that Google is already using machine learning to scan over a billion devices daily and more than 50 billion apps every day to prevent the spread of malware. Google Play Protect is basically a way to show phone owners how the operating system is keeping their device safe.\nAndroid Go for cheap phones\nGoogle is launching \"Android Go\" to make it easier for manufacturers to build cheaper phones for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. The experience is essentially a few different optimisations that ship with any Android O devices with 1 GB or less of memory.\nFirst, Google will make the latest version of its operating system, Android O, work on phones with lower specs. This means the company will cut away some of the more demanding processes and animations.\nOf course, beyond the phone's performance, data cost and intermittent connectivity have proven to be among the greatest challenges faced in emerging markets. Google is targeting this problem by creating data management quick settings that can be accessed by pulling down the menu from the top of the screen. The company has also created an API that carriers can integrate with to make sure that you phone's not gobbling up too much of your pre-paid data.\nGoogle apps will also get smarter about data. The Chrome data saver feature that simplifies web pages, for example, will be turned on by default. The Android Go version of the app will also show users how much data they have saved by using this optimised version of Chrome.\nAdditionally, Google introduced YouTube Go, which gives users a preview of videos before the whole thing is downloaded. It also has the ability to save videos while you're connected, so you can watch them later when you're offline. For more info on this project you can check out the Building For Billions developer page.\nGoogle's brain is getting way smarter\nTechnically, the Google brain isn't part of Android specifically, but it will dramatically affect the way we use our Android devices, so it feels right to include here. One of the biggest announcements at this year's conference is the announcement that Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent competitor to Siri, is finally coming to the iPhone. The app is free for download in the US iTunes store starting today and integrates with other Google services like Calendar and YouTube. It's also getting a slew of new improvements.\nAndroid Auto speeds up\nAndroid Auto hasn't gotten much love or attention since it launched in March 2015, but that changed this year thanks to the tweaks made under the hood of Android O. The new operating system gives Android Auto a much-needed performance boost that means it will boot up faster and switch between applications more quickly in your car. It also means that things like notifications will be bundled together more nicely, making it easier to use your docked phone while you're driving.\nGoogle also announced that Audi and Volvo will be using Android as the operating system in upcoming cars. The obvious appeal here is all the new voice-control capabilities enabled through Google Assistant, which is already integrated into Android Auto. The key update is that now Assistant and Android will be able to control car functions like heating, cooling and seat positioning in cars from Audi and Volvo.\nAndroid Wear basically stays the same\nSadly, we didn't see any major updates to Android Wear at this year's conference. Android Wear 2.0 only debuted in February, so it makes sense that Google is still working on getting the operating system on old smartwatches and polishing the latest release. Given the slow adoption rate of Android Wear, we have a feeling most people won't care about the lack of updates (yet) at this year's conference.\n}}

{{If you\u2019re like me, the first time you heard of wireless display mirroring, your first question was \u2013 how? With Google\u2019s new Android 4.2 Jelly Bean+ operating system update, wireless mirroring is included in the code \u2013 but how does that work without the hardware to back it up? As it turns out, this whole situation has to do with Miracast wireless display sharing \u2013 an industry standard that allows your device to connect to larger device\u2019s displays using your wi-fi network as a middle-man.\nWith Miracast being an \u201cindustry standard\u201d, you can expect many brands to pick it up soon if they don\u2019t already have it integrated now. Miracast is a technology that\u2019s built in to devices \u2013 it\u2019s not a device in and of itself. Miracast certification has begun for devices of many kinds, so you can expect not just displays to have it integrated, but receivers that will plug in through your HDMI port instead \u2013 this working for legacy displays.\nManufacturer Adoption\nOne of the companies that has adopted Miracast as their wireless standard is NVIDIA \u2013 another is Texas Instruments. Have a peek at this hands-on video from Texas Instruments showing off Miracast working earlier this year.\nDevices out Now\nWith devices like the Netgear Push2TV PTV3000 you\u2019ll be able to plug directly into whatever giant monitor you\u2019ve got right now just so long as it\u2019s got an HDMI port \u2013 it connects to wi-fi on its own. A lovely Broadcom 5G Wi-fi chip was introduced all the way back in July of 2012 that set up for the wireless display future \u2013 that future being now, of course. The Nexus 10 (by Samsung) and the Nexus 4 (by LG) will both be released with Android 4.2 which will have Miracast capabilities built-in.\nThe Future\nThe future can actually be yours right this second if you have a way of getting ahold of a device with Android 4.2 on it \u2013 if it\u2019s an official working build, of course \u2013 as well as a Miracast-capable display. They do exist on the market today and they\u2019re in stores right this second. In the very near future \u2013 and throughout 2013 and forward, we must expect, Miracast will be adopted by many, many television sets as well as displays of all kinds. More wireless dongles will be created, and Android devices from all manner of manufacturers will be able to make use of this technology.\nLG has dedicated themselves to Miracast for the future \u2013 that\u2019s one brand guaranteed to have the technology in essentially all their sets throughout 2013. With the folks at the Wi-Fi Alliance backing this certification for the whole industry, we\u2019ll see many more groups jump onboard soon. Doubly so now that Android is bringing support from the other end of the living room. Exciting times are ahead \u2013 no more getting up from the couch to plug your smartphone in to the HDMI cord for you!\n}}

{{Although Apple\u2019s dominance in the smartphone market with their iPhone has been outnumbered by the amount of Android alternatives available, they are still regarded as the one to beat when it comes to the tablet market, which their iPad dominates. Today\u2019s news suggests their dominance may be threatened now however as Android gains tablet market momentum.\nThe figures according to Strategy Analytics, which were reported by The Telegraph, show Android tablet sales tripled to 10.5 million worldwide as the total tablet market grew to 26.8 million in the last quarter of 2011 from 10.7 million at the same time the year before. Windows 7 tablet and BlackBerry PlayBook sales accounted for less than a million of those units between them. Meanwhile Apple managed to more than double the total amount of iPads they shifted in the last quarter of 2010 during the last quarter of 2011 which also suggests momentum, although not as much as Android tablets.\nAt the same time Apple also lost 10% of the global market share reducing it to 58% from 68% the year before, while the Android tablet global market share climbed to 39%. This is where Android threatens Apple\u2019s dominance as market share is the key and they clearly have the upper hand. A similar situation occurred in the smartphone market which is now dominated by Android handsets despite the iPhone being the best-selling smartphone on the market.\nDespite the figures and the momentum gained by Android, Apple could still end up retaining their dominance as their next-gen devices are always hotly anticipated and the iPad 3 is rumored to be released later this year, as well as the iPhone 5. The Android OS will continue to feature in more devices however which certainly aids their market share. Do you think the iPad is at threat of losing its dominance in the tablet market?\n}}

Android Q has a new feature that lets you create a QR code for your Wi-Fi network, or scan a QR code to join a Wi-Fi network, directly in the device's Wi-Fi settings.\nUndo app removal\nScreenshot by Jason Cipriani\/CNET\nEver accidentally remove an app from your home screen, and then realize you can't remember what app was there? I have.\nWith Android Q, you have a few seconds after an app has been removed to undo the change. You'll find the undo button along the bottom of the screen. Press it and bam, the app is back where it belongs.\nLocation control\nEnlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani\/CNET\nAndroid is finally getting more granular control over how an app can use location information. Currently, you can give an app access to your location either all the time or not all. With Android Q, you will gain the option of letting an app access your location information only while you're actively using the app.\nNot only is this a privacy matter, but it surely helps save on battery life.\nPrivacy settings\nScreenshots by Jason Cipriani\/CNET\nWith Android Q, there's now a dedicated Privacy section in the settings app. Opening it will reveal the various permissions apps can request for things like calendar, location, camera, contacts and microphone.\nAndroid has lacked a clear-cut way to view what apps have access to what data on your device. The new section makes it easy to discover and revoke permissions for specific apps.\nBetter notification controls\nEnlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani\/CNET\nWhen you long-press an alert, you're now given a few different options for managing how you are alerted by the app: Block, \"Show silently\" and \"Keep alerting.\"\nThis is a small but important feature because you no longer have to dig into the Settings app to figure out how to tailor an app's alerts. You simply long-press, pick an option and you're done.\n}}

{{Candy Crush Saga maker King has launched Pet Rescue Puzzle Saga, a new mobile game for Android and iOS devices.\nPet Rescue Puzzle Saga is the second installment in the popular Pet Rescue game franchise, and it is a colorful match\u20102 clicker game where players go on an epic puzzle adventure with Fern the Fox to save lost pets and bring them home to safety. It\u2019s one of the titles that King needs to keep its revenues going, as its other successful mobile games aren\u2019t going to last forever.\nThe free-to-play title has new gameplay features like The Pet Home, which lets \u2010 a feature that allows you to build, customize, and design a beautiful home for the rescued pets. Players can choose from a selection of rooms to add to their homes, ranging from a kitchen, a bathroom, a games room and even a music room to accommodate the adorable animals. They can also interact with the pets by feeding, washing or playing with them in exchange for in\u2010game rewards.\nThe new game offers scrolling levels, where players will need to match and click through more than one screen of puzzles to complete the levels, and underwater levels, where players must adapt to the antigravity gameplay and rescue the snorkeling pets.\nOther new game features include rescue missions for pets of all shapes and sizes, as well as harvesting game modes where players must break blocks, burst bubbles and destroy crates to win the level.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be launching Pet Rescue Puzzle Saga today,\u201d said David Nelson, lead producer at the Malmo Studio at King, in a statement. \u201cWe enhanced the player experience by evolving the narrative, improving the quality of the graphics and creating innovative gameplay. In particular, we think the players will love the deeper connection they can have with the pets. They can look after them in the Pet home, personalize and customize their environments and give them cool swag.\u201d\nThe game has 35 pets and 650 levels available at launch. King had 268 million monthly active users as of fourth quarter 2018 across web, social and mobile platforms, and has developed more than 200 exclusive games that are enjoyed all around the world through its king.com, Facebook, and mobile distribution platforms such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Microsoft Windows App Store, and Amazon Appstore. King has been a division of Activision Blizzard since February 2016.\n}}

{{Owners of iOS devices are spoilt for choice when it comes to docking stations to use their mobile device with. It\u2019s just a simple case of sliding the device on and then being able to listen to your music and charge the device at the same time. Meanwhile users of the Android platform have had to plug their device in via a lead or they weren\u2019t universal. Now Philips looks to have overcome this after launching their new Flexidock Android docking stations.\nThe company has launched three new products that work with the free Fidelio Android app, which according to Recombu enables automatic Bluetooth paring as soon as the device is docked. The flagship model is the Philips Fidelio AS851 costing \u00a3199 that can be seen above, which is a unit designed to be used in the living room.\nIt has a claimed output of 30 watts alongside Philips Digital sound processing, which is designed to reduce distortion. You also get a remote control for a unit that shares the same body as the Fidelio DS8500 iPod dock. It was found using the device with the Samsung Galaxy Note the Flexidock worked well.\nWith this the handset could be used over the other side of the room, but it did unsurprisingly drain the battery quicker. If you receive a message it can be heard through both the handset and the dock. Other models in the range include the Fidelio AS351 costing \u00a3129,which has a 10 watt output with Dynamic Bass Boost for lower level tones.\nThe cheapest of the range is the Philips Fidelio AS111 that has been designed to be used as a bedside clock with a 360-degree speaker, and costs \u00a370. Philips has also announced they are working on an Airplay equivalent Android Wireless HiFi docks, which will be released next year. The new devices are available now from Dixons Group stores and selected online retailers.\n}}

{{HTC has a new flagship, the One A9, and it\u2019s going to be controversial. Hero device after the One M9 and M9+, it\u2019s one of the first Android 6.0 Marshmallow phones outside of Google\u2019s own Nexus, and with a highly competitive price tag that belies its build quality. That controversy? Just about everyone agrees, the One A9\u2019s design is\u2026 familiar. Exactly what it\u2019s familiar to depends on who you are, though.\nIf you\u2019re HTC, you describe it as being a combination of the shape of the plastic-bodied Desire 816 of 2013, and the metal unibody of the One M8 and M9. \u201cI just want to set the record straight,\u201d lead designer Catherine Kim insisted, \u201cwe actually came up with all these ideas, and then converged them into the One A9.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re, well, anybody else, the new smartphone almost certainly reminds you of Apple\u2019s iPhone 6s.\nThe two aren\u2019t identical, mind. The One A9 has a sharper transition between the front and back of the phone and its sides; that\u2019s allowed HTC to use different finishes, with brushed metal on the back and bead-blasted polish on the edges.\nCNC milled, the ridged power button is easy to find with a fingertip underneath the volume keys, while on the opposite site there\u2019s the SIM slot and the memory card slot.\nHTC has been refining its embedded antenna technology for several generations of device now, and the One A9 has the narrowest strips of plastic yet. Where the iPhone 6s has a crescent that runs up and around the camera \u2013 left-aligned on Apple\u2019s phone, but dead-center on the HTC \u2013 the One A9 hides that portion more successfully, in a lozenge of plastic embedded into the top edge.\nI\u2019m torn about the design. On the one hand, I can already hear the criticism from iPhone fans, and they\u2019re not without some grounds. Leave an iPhone 6s on the table next to the One A9, and the similarities are glaring.\nOn the flip side, this is one of the most cleanly designed and executed Android phones in recent memory. Not as big so as to be unwieldy, but still eminently usable. Premium feeling in the hand, clever in its detailing; it\u2019s a genuinely appealing device.\nLooking past the design for the moment, on the front is a 5-inch AMOLED screen covered in 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 3 [Update: HTC has confirmed it incorrectly announced it was Gorilla Glass 4 at launch, whereas in fact it is 3]. It\u2019s a Full HD panel, not QHD, but frankly that\u2019s no significant compromise for a display of this size. The AMOLED blacks are pitch-deep and the colors pop.\nUnderneath, there\u2019s a multidirectional fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button, and on the bottom the 3.5mm headphone jack and a microUSB port. Why no USB-C? HTC tells me that\u2019s a decision made between it and the carriers, which don\u2019t see the new port gaining traction in accessories until midway through 2016. Perhaps that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s still annoying doing without a plug that works in either orientation.\nInside, there\u2019s a perhaps surprising choice of processor: Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 617 octacore. The absence of an 800-series chipset may prompt furrowed brows, but HTC says it\u2019s a deliberate decision rather than just a cost-cutting compromise.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to argue the case that what\u2019s more important today [than processor speed] is supporting all the networking things that the carriers are doing,\u201d HTC\u2019s portfolio chief Nigel Newby-House argues. Sure enough, the One A9 supports carrier-aggregation on its Cat.6 LTE\nThe Snapdragon 617 is paired with 3GB of memory and 32GB of storage \u2013 in the US, at least; Europe will be offered a 2GB, 16GB version \u2013 and of course you still get a microSD card slot.\nThe new aesthetic comes with some sacrifices if you\u2019re an HTC fan of old. Gone are the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, replaced with a single speaker on the bottom edge. According to HTC, trying to fit stereo drivers would\u2019ve forced the engineers to move the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone, where it would\u2019ve been less ergonomically placed and also make the One A9 thicker.\nHowever, if \u2013 like me \u2013 you listen to your music with headphones more often than out-loud from your phone, that experience should actually be improved. There\u2019s Dolby Surround Sound and Dolby Noise Reduction, plus a dedicated amp for the headphone jack. The One A9 also supports 24-bit sound, and since native files of that bitrate are relatively rare, it can upsample too.\nOn the front, there\u2019s an UltraPixel sensor with f\/2.0 optics for selfies, while on the back is a 13-megapixel camera with f\/2.0 lens and, praise be, optical image stabilization (OIS). HTC was criticized for dropping the One M7\u2019s OIS on the M8 and M9, and so I\u2019m not going to be alone in welcoming it back with open arms.\nIt\u2019s been a few years of camera experimentation for HTC. First there was UltraPixel, emphasizing low-light performance but at the expense of resolution. The One M9 swung in the opposite direction, but its 20-megapixel sensor struggled more in low-light, and lacked OIS of course.\nThe One A9 sits somewhere in-between. Picture resolution is sufficiently high that cropping out a section of interest doesn\u2019t leave you with a comically low-res image, but the pixels are large enough that low-light performance should be credible.\nHTC is leaving nothing to chance, though, and so there\u2019s both auto and pro modes, the latter spitting out RAW images for post-processing. Even if you just hit auto-enhance in the HTC Gallery, RAW shots should see an improvement, particularly those which were taken in low-light conditions.\nZoe photos are supported \u2013 yes, HTC was combining stills and video before Apple did Live Photos \u2013 as are hyperlapse shots. Cleverly, HTC uses the gyroscope and accelerometer to better line-up each of the images in the latter, for smoother videos.\nThe only things missing, really, are laser autofocus as LG has been using lately \u2013 and which HTC says was just too bulky to accommodate \u2013 and 4K video recording. Instead, the One A9 tops out at 1080p.\nThe last big hardware surprise is the battery. The shock isn\u2019t that it\u2019s non-removable, which is to be expected from HTC these days, but instead its size: just 2,150 mAh. The One A9 does support Quick Charge 3.0, though, for much faster recharging with a higher-power AC adapter, and unlike previous Quick Charge enabled HTC phones there\u2019ll actually be just such an adapter in the box.\nOn paper, the One A9 should last for up to 12 hours of HD video playback, up to 9 hours of WiFi internet browsing, or up to 16 hours of 3G talktime.\nOver on the software side, HTC Sense is still evident in places, but Android 6.0 Marshmallow is left to show through far more than any earlier iteration of Google\u2019s OS. There\u2019s Android Pay, Now On Tap, and both Doze and App Standby.\nAs Newby-House points out, Sense originally came about because Android itself wasn\u2019t really market-ready. HTC filled in the gaps and what began as a skin and a few custom apps grew to the all-encompassing software experience familiar from the One M8 and M9.\nIn the meantime, though, Google has refined Android considerably, yet HTC finds a large proportion of its engineers still working on modifying it to the house style. \u201cThe A9 caused us to think about Sense, and Sense\u2019s position on this phone,\u201d Newby-House explains. \u201cThis is our first step to thinking of Sense as a scaled-down experience.\u201d\nSo, there\u2019ll still be things like BlinkFeed, and HTC apps, but they won\u2019t be tied so deeply into the phone\u2019s kernel. Some optional software and widgets will be distributed through the Play store for HTC users, and the company will be able to update its own tweaked elements more easily, rather than having to wait for a more significant OS release.\nThat should also mean faster Android updates. HTC currently aims for a 90 day window after Google releases the code for a new version, but the One A9\u2019s more low-key modifications should see that time dwindle.\nAs HTC has found to its cost, however, just because it makes a strong device, doesn\u2019t mean sales are necessarily going to be equally strong. So, the One A9 is priced ambitiously too: when it hits shelves in the US in November it\u2019ll have a sticker of $399.99 unlocked with 32GB of storage.\nThat, it\u2019s worth noting, is $50 less than the 32GB Moto X Pure Edition. HTC will offer it through its own webstore \u2013 preorders start today, for a device that\u2019s SIM-unlocked and with an unlockable bootloader that doesn\u2019t void the warranty in the process \u2013 but the carriers are getting in on the action, too. Initially Opal Silver and Carbon Gray will be the US color options, with a Deep Garnet red version and a Topaz Gold model down the line. Internationally, HTC has confirmed UK pricing will start at \u00a3429.99 for the 16GB model with 2GB of memory.\nThere\u2019s a whole lot to like about the HTC One A9, though plenty of lingering questions. Will the Snapdragon 617 processor prove a weak link, or will battery life end up undermining the whole experience? I\u2019ll be answering those questions in our full review; until then, let me know what you think in the comments.\n}}

{{If you have a Chromebook, you may no longer have an excuse to ignore your friends' texts. Android 8.1 (which is still in developer preview) includes a new \"SMS Connect\" feature that could allow you to send and receive text messages on your computer.\nThe feature is currently being shown as an APK file in the developer preview. You might be able to launch and set up using an activity browser, and you may also need to enable it on a Chromebook by typing \"chrome:\/\/flags\" into your address bar and turning on \"Enable Multidevice features.\"\nThe operative word here is \"may.\" This new feature was first spotted on a developer preview of Android 8.1 by Ars Technica and Chrome Unboxed, neither of whom could get it to work.\nIt seems that, for now, the buttons are a placeholder for a feature that is to come in the full version. Still, the nod to such an update is exciting.\nWhether the function will be enabled on all Android phones or exclusively the Google Pixel remains to be seen. It's also not clear how text notifications will be delivered. They could come in text onscreen, as do iMessages in macOS, or could potentially be incorporated into Google Assistant.\nIt's already possible for Mac users to send and receive from a Macbook using iMessage. But you can only iMessage other iPhone users who also have iMessage enabled. If Chrome OS can send texts to all phone users, rather than just users of Google Pixel or Android, Google's new feature could serve as a more versatile alternative.\nBut whatever you do, don't tell your annoying friends about this feature, or you'll have to stop pretending that you didn't see their messages.\n}}

{{Ed Rhee\/CNET\nRemotely accessing a Windows PC can be a convenient way to access files and programs when you can't physically be at the same place as the remote PC. It's also a good way to troubleshoot problems with the remote PC as long as the problems aren't network-related.\nThere are some very good mobile apps already that allow you to connect to remote systems from your tablet or smartphone, like TeamViewer and Splashtop. Microsoft's RD client for Android, however, is free and doesn't require you to install an agent on your PC to use it. If you want to check out Microsoft Remote Desktop for Android, here's how to get started:\nEnable remote connections on your PC\nStep 1: Even though you don't need to install an agent on your Windows PC, you do still need to enable remote connections. On both Windows 7 and Windows 8, go to Control Panel > System and Security > System, then click on \"Remote settings\" from the left pane.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nStep 2: Under Remote Desktop, make sure that you allow remote connections to the computer and choose Network Level Authentication. If you have problems connecting, you can try disabling Network Level Authentication. You can also restrict connections to specific users by clicking on the Select Users button.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nConnect to your PC with an Android device\nStep 1: Make sure when you launch the RD client, that you're on the Remote Desktops tab. From there, tap on the \"+\" to add a new connection.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nStep 2: Enter a name for the connection, the host name or IP address of the remote PC, and the log-in credentials if you want them saved. If you leave the credentials blank, you'll be prompted for them at the start of the connection. Tap \"Done\" to save the remote desktop connection.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nStep 3: Tap on the connection you just created to connect. If you get an untrusted certificate prompt, select \"Trust Once\" or \"Trust Always,\" if you trust the remote PC. You should then see your remote PC's desktop.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nNavigating the remote connection\nThe connection bar at the top has two icons: the pan icon on the left and the keyboard icon on the right. Tap on the pan icon to zoom in on the desktop and move around. The keyboard icon displays or hides an onscreen keyboard. If the connection bar is in your way, you can long press on it, then move it from side to side.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nTapping on the connection bar will bring up the utility bar. With the utility bar, you can disable multitouch and use a cursor instead, display modifier keys for shortcuts, and access many extra keyboard keys, like the F-keys. Hint: double-tapping on the Windows key will toggle between the desktop and the Start screen in Windows 8.\nScreenshot by Ed Rhee\/CNET\nTo disconnect from the remote PC, tap the back button of your Android device twice. Also, if there are remote PCs that you frequently connect to, you can create direct shortcuts to them using the Remote Desktop widget.\n}}

{{Android GO is a special configuration of Android, not a separate version, that\u2019s designed to work with hardware-constrained smartphones. There is the immediate presumption that it, therefore, caters only to emerging markets and lower. That said, everyone everywhere deserves to have an Android phone, no matter the budget. Fortunately, Android Go smartphones are starting to come into the US and the latest to join those ranks is the Moto E5.\nAdmittedly, one of the drawbacks of Android Go phones is that they tend to sound and look boring compared even to mid-range phones. That can\u2019t be helped since you can only cram so much into a smartphone without bumping up the price tag. That said, the 5th gen Moto E phone still manages to hold its own in design and features.\nCheap doesn\u2019t have to mean ugly. While it\u2019s far from looking premium, the Moto E5 bears Motorola\u2019s iconic design, with the large circular rear camera sitting above the fingerprint sensor underneath the \u201cbatwing\u201d logo. And just because it\u2019s an entry-level phone doesn\u2019t mean it has to miss out on the 18:9 screen craze, though there\u2019s still plenty of bezels to go around.\nSpecs-wise, the Moto E5 runs on a Snapdragon 425 with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of expandable storage. That 5.7-inch 18:9 screen sports a resolution of 1440\u00d7720 HD+. No notches here. The 8 megapixel main camera and 5 megapixel selfie camera might not be the best, but they should be serviceable. And the 4,000 mAh will most likely carry you through days, not hours.\nOf course, the real appeal of the Moto E5 is Android Oreo Go Edition, which an almost (but not completely) pure and fast Android experience and a suite of Go apps that respect your hardware and data limitations. Most importantly, the Moto E5 also respects your budget, with a $99.99 price tag on Best Buy via prepaid carrier SIMPLE Mobile.\n}}

{{Just as it should, Google is always changing Android in order to harden it not just against hackers but also against unscrupulous app developers. You know, the ones that might not give a second thought about stealing your private data from under your noses. Sometimes, however, those changes entail removing privileges and access to features that some developers and users may have become accustomed to. In the upcoming Android Q, such another change will be coming and, this time, the ax will fall on apps read and manage items you copy to Android\u2019s clipboard.\nThe last disruptive privacy-related change Google introduce limited access to SMS and Call Logs for apps that weren\u2019t Messaging or Phone apps. This would have resulted in the likes of automation platform Tasker and even Titanium Backup losing important but not \u201ccore\u201d functionality. Fortunately, Google decided to allow exceptions on a case-to-case basis.\nFor Android Q, the change will affect access to the platform\u2019s clipboard. The recently launched beta mentions that apps cannot access clipboard data unless it\u2019s the default input method editor (IME). In other words, only the current default keyboard can read from the clipboard and other apps running in the background can\u2019t.\nThis change is meant to prevent apps from copying, say, passwords or other sensitive data without user knowledge. However, it does also lock out legitimate apps that use clipboard data for other purposes, like passing them to a PC for seamless copying and pasting between devices. With Android Q, those apps would have to present themselves as keyboards, something that isn\u2019t entirely convenient for both users and developers.\nOne potential problem, however, is that the change seems to affect any app running under Android Q, whether that app targets the version of Android or not. This is contrary to what Google says and is hopefully just a bug. Even more hopefully, Google will find a way to satisfy privacy needs without blocking valid use cases.\n}}

{{Hey, Microsoft: it's time to step down from the internet throne and hand the crown over to Android.\nThe latest internet usage data from StatCounter, an independent web analytics firm, found that Android overtook Microsoft Windows for the world's largest share of internet usage by operating system last month. It was the first time\u2014ever\u2014that Microsoft wasn't in the top spot, signaling the ever-increasing shift in global internet consumption habits from desktop PCs to mobile.\nSEE ALSO: Google now offers a free Android app every week\n\"This is a milestone in technology history and the end of an era,\" StatCounter CEO Aodhan Cullen said in a statement. Windows has been the most common OS online since the dawn of time, aka the 1980s.\nStatCounter based its report on data from 2.5 million websites around the world, which it says typically generate over 15 billion pageviews per month.\nThis wasn't a huge shift, as unprecedented as it may have been. Android internet usage only edged out Windows by only .02 percent, coming in at 37.93 percent of the total market to Windows' 37.91 percent.\nWhat's more remarkable is the rapid year-over-year growth of Android usage, especially in light of Windows' free-fall from dominance.\nImage: Statcounter\nMuch of Android's growth stems directly from inroads the OS has made in the developing world, where it, and mobile devices in general, are the dominant means to get online. Meanwhile, global PC sales, where Microsoft's Windows OS maintains a huge advantage over all comers, have dropped every year since 2012.\nAndroid is dominant in developing markets. Image: statcounter\nWorldwide, Microsoft still holds strong as the dominant internet OS, holding strong to North America, Russia, and much of Europe. In North America, Android wasn't even the runner up \u2014 StatCounter reports iOS held a nearly five percent advantage, 25.7 percent of users to Android's 21.2 percent.\nAndroid holds the title for March 2017 \u2014 and with internet access growing around the world, it very well could widen the gap going forward. Apple's increased focus on some of those markets might cut into Android's dominance, but until there's another major shift, Android could be the OS king for the foreseeable future.\n}}

{{On Saturday, the Verge unveiled some leaked documents that indicate that Google is preparing to launch Android TV, a home viewing experience described as \"less ambitious and easier to understand\" than competitors such as Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon\u2019s Android-based Fire TV. \"Access to content should be simple and magical,\" says one of the Google memos. One of the ways Android TV might realize that goal is by \"proactively\" recommending programs: That could mean doing away with endless browsing or it could mean having a fresh batch of \"You Might Like This\" suggestions to decline.\nThe entry point here, the Verge writes, \u201cis people lazing on the couch\u201d and not necessarily \u201cinventive new applications that harness the big screen.\u201d Images show that apps like Vevo, Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora (already popular on Apple TV, Fire TV, and Roku) will share consistent interfaces onscreen with Google in-house apps like Play Movies, YouTube, and Hangouts. It\u2019s not clear where Google\u2019s Chromecast HDMI dongle will fit into the product, but \u201cThe Verge understands that the Chromecast won\u2019t go away, so that may mean developers will have to build two different interfaces.\u201d Bottom line: You\u2019ll never run out of TV to watch.\n}}

{{FORTNITE MOBILE is available on iOS and is coming to Android eventually. Here's when Epic Games could launch the game on Android devices.\nDS Fortnite Mobile Android Release: is THIS when Epic Games Android downloads will begin?\nLast week it was revealed that Fortnite's mobile release had topped the iOS charts in 47 countries less than 24 hours after launch; ranking within the top 10 in 58 countries. In addition, data released by Sensor Tower suggested that the Battle Royale game has also amassed over $1.5 million worldwide, following numerous in-app purchases. Which is no mean feat, especially when you take into consideration that so far the game has only been released to a handful of 'invite only' users. So just think how much more Epic Games could make should they do a full rollout, not just on iOS but also Android. That being said, it's not clear yet when Epic could release the game on Android. More recently, Nick Chester, PR Manager for Epic Games, suggested that the delay is largely because of the sheer wealth of Android devices on the market. \u201cThere\u2019s a very wide range of Android devices that we want to support. \"We want to make sure Android players have a great experience, so we\u2019re taking more time to get it right.\u201c Because of these difficulties, it's possible that Epic might be waiting to release with Android's next big update, Android P.\nFortnite Mobile FIRST LOOK Sign-up now for the Fortnite Battle Royale Invite Event on iOS! 1 \/ 27\nAndroid P, nicknamed Android Pistachio Ice Cream internally, has already been released for developer preview but only for Google's own Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones. According to TechAdvisor the consumer preview of Android 9.0 will most likely be announced during the Google I\/O 2018 event, which is expected to take place in mid-May, potentially 16-18 May 2018. This could then be followed by a final consumer release in August 2018. Of course, this doesn't mean that all devices in August will suddenly have Android P, it normally takes a few months for most manufacturers to update their new phones with the latest operating system. It would, however, be the ideal moment for Epic Games to roll out the game on Android by targetting the latest and most up to date OS. Not to mention, it would allow plenty of months between now and then for Epic to complete a full-scale Apple iOS release. So if you own an Android phone, prepare to wait quite sometime before you get that Battle Royale feeling on your Android smartphone.

{{One look at the Android app marketplace seems akin to looking into a bottomless pit. There seems to be a profusion of apps of all kinds helping people get entertained, get healthier, read books, stay updated with news and so many others. Discoverability of a new app in this marketplace is complex and has to be approached with a huge degree of smart thinking and out of the box creativity. For a publisher this crowded app market place means they have to come up with a stand out app and this requirement is even more intense in the Android app space.\nIn a pitched battle for supremacy, Android and Apple are introducing new apps almost everyday in order to attain top dog status. Android is certainly one of the biggest app stores and offers an immense array of variety, diversity and access to multiple kinds of devices. This is truly a publisher\u2019s idea of app- utopia! One of the biggest features or enablers that a publisher must use when he creates apps for the Android space is the rich user experience that this operating system offers. From the use of in-app advertising to creating apps that engage the user almost immediately, publishers can use all the tricks of the trade to create dazzling apps.\nSome factors to keep in mind\nCreating apps has to begin with identifying the target market or the customer. It would also be more practical to identify a niche segment in terms of devices as well. Android operates in a vast range of devices and it might be easier to target a limited number of these devices. A publisher can use the power of Android on a smartphone, for instance to sell his application to. User experience is key! If the app loads too slowly or there are too many advertisements cluttering up the screen then the user is likely to \u201cswitch off\u201d from the application. If advertisements are the chosen method of marketing then the publisher should ensure that the ads load really swiftly and do not take too much time. Ideally, offer a sweet tooth reward and get the user to not only watch the ad but also click through to the website.\nEnhancing discoverability\nThere is a large number of ways in which you can enhance the visibility and discoverability of your application through android app marketing. For an Android app publisher, the Amazon App Store for Android is a big blessing! As of 2012 February, this App Store has more than 25,000 apps.\nThere is also Google Play, which has an even larger number of apps but the Amazon Store helps publishers make more money! Social media also has its iPlay, which has an even larger number of apps, keting and one such forum is Facebook. Facebook has entered the space of mobile apps just this year but the reach of this social networking tool holds a lot of promise to improve discoverability for the Android apps. Facebook itself has 800 million users and counting. For a publisher it makes sense to have Facebook API running on their apps.\n}}

{{Saab, purveyor of WASPmobiles since time immemorial, is bursting out of its shell at the International Motor Show in Geneva this week with a hot little concept car sure to scandalize Saab loyalists from Stockholm to Walnut Creek.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nThe PhoneiX is a sporty, sexy thing, with butterfly doors and a rippling silver body that looks like T-1000 morphed himself into some sort of latter-day DeLorean. Inside, it\u2019s got race car-inspired styling and a cutting-edge infotainment system powered by Android. All in all, the car is cool, sleek, and over-the-top \u2014 in other words, everything Saab isn\u2019t. And it isn\u2019t just a fluke. As Jason Castriota, Saab executive design director, tells it, the car presages a radical new direction for the trusty Swedish car maker. \u201cIt symbolizes a renaissance of the innovative spirit and passion that drove Saab to build its first car,\u201d he says in a media release. \u201cThis design aesthetic will shape and differentiate future models in the Saab portfolio.\u201d It\u2019s an aesthetic that elevates aerodynamics above all else. (Saab calls it \u201careomotional\u201d design, which is only slightly less annoying than capitalizing the \u201cX\u201d in \u201cPhoeniX\u201d). The company\u2019s aviation roots were a big inspiration here, and the teardrop shell tips a hat to the Ursaab, a 1940s prototype that spawned Saab\u2019s first generation of cars. A sawed-off tail echoes Saab\u2019s first coupe, the Sonett. And side-mounted \u201cwinglets\u201d are a peek of the future; they channel airflow across the rear deck, slashing lift without increasing drag. The car\u2019s drag co-efficient is only 0.25.\nadvertisement\nThe interior is designed to mimic what the press release calls ?the stripped-out feel of a competition car.\u201d So it has a 2+2 cabin and shell-like seats and a display pod in front of the driver, shaped like the afterburner of a jet engine. Angled at 45 degrees from the driver is the Saab IQon, a touchscreen, which taps Google Android\u2019s operating system to create a full-blown infotainment center. IQon comes with the obvious features, like online navigation and music storage, but it can also be customized to show impossibly detailed data, from engine speed and torque to barometric pressure and the position of the sun. Pretty bad-ass stuff, huh? We\u2019ll see which elements Saab actually feeds into the new models. Obviously, the company can\u2019t go too crazy, lest it lose its customer base, the rich, guilty liberals who love tooling around in a car that\u2019s more expensive than it looks. But even if the next gen lifts a pinch of what we\u2019re seeing here, Saab\u2019s message will be crystal clear: It isn\u2019t just catering to ladies who lunch at the farmer\u2019s market anymore.\n}}

The 1.3-megapixel, Wi-Fi-connected camera allows user to keep tabs on their home, children, pets or elderly family members remotely by streaming video directly to their smartphone.\nIn addition to its ability to stream audio and \u201chigh-definition\u201d (640\u00d7480 resolution, 30fps) video to iOS and Android devices, or a PC, via a peer-to-peer network, the Smart Cam is advertised as having the easiest set-up of any of this new breed of low-cost home monitoring systems. Simply click a button on the Smart Cam, then the WPS button on your Wi-Fi router, and you\u2019re ready to start keeping tabs.\nUsers can also set up audio and video sensor notifications, which alert the user anytime their device is triggered. The device, which can be mounted to a wall, or just set on a shelf, can also be set up to automatically record anytime the device\u2019s sensors are activated, and upload the content to a private YouTube account for later viewing. Night-vision recording is also available thanks to the Smart Cam\u2019s non-visible infrared LEDs, which are effective up to 15 feet.\nWhile there are a number of other comparable products out there, the easy set-up of the Smart Cam really does seem to us like the best aspect of this device. We weren\u2019t able to set up a new one ourselves, of course, but the process already sounds infinitely more simple than comparable devices, like the iZon, which is also only available for iOS devices.\nThe Samsung Smart Cam will be available in March for $150.\nCheck out a weird press video of the Smart Cam below:\n}}

{{Facebook\u2019s data-conserving version of Messenger is no longer just for developing nations with slow networks. Now the Messenger Lite Android app is expanding to the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland after previously being available in more than 100 mostly developing countries. Messenger Lite packs most of the critical features of the app, but skips things like Messenger Day and selfie lenses that can drain data. There\u2019s still no plan for an iOS version, though.\nPreviously, Messenger Lite was primarily for users in areas with weak bandwidth so the app would run faster. But now its expansion into Facebook\u2019s top developed world markets makes it a tool for penny-pinching users like teenagers who want to avoid burning away their pricey megabytes but still stay in touch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring Messenger Lite to Android users in four new markets, including Canada, Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S.,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cMessenger Lite is a slimmed-down version of Messenger that offers the core features of the app, while giving everyone the opportunity to stay connected to their friends and family, regardless of device or quality of internet connectivity.\u201d\nFacebook first launched Messenger Lite in October 2016 in five countries before its near global expansion in April. Now Sensor Tower estimates Messenger Lite has been download 47 million times since launch, led by India and Brazil.\nThe new rollout could help Facebook attract more teens to Messenger, both traditional and Lite. That\u2019s because if downloading Lite makes them respond to more messages more quickly, it thereby encourages friends to stick with Messenger instead of defaulting back to SMS or iMessage, or straying to Snapchat.\nThe developing world has proven a challenge for Snapchat. Its video-heavy app doesn\u2019t perform well in low-bandwidth conditions. And where there are friends who can\u2019t use an app, people end up switching to one they can access. For Messenger to keep expanding beyond its existing 1.3 billion users, it needs to do everything it can to be maximally accessible.\nThough it may be harder to monetize Messenger Lite users, it\u2019s worth it for Facebook as chat is the center of the mobile use case. If it can keep people on Messenger, it\u2019s more likely to retain them in the rest of its family of apps.\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nIn the increasingly fierce smartphone patent wars, HTC is an underdog, and now that Apple's successfully won a ban on several HTC phones beginning on April 12, 2012, some wonder if the Chinese company can survive another fight. The International Trade Commission (ITC) handed down the ruling on Monday, stating that HTC must either settle or stop selling its device in the United States due to infringing on Apple's patents. HTC quickly issued a statement ensuring the public that its \"designers have created alternate solutions\" that would avoid the ban. The court paperwork cites the patents in question, noting the the ban applies specifically to patent #5,946,647. HTC said, \"the \u2018647 patent is a small UI experience and HTC will completely remove it from all of our phones soon.\" Fortune explains what the patent actually covers in plain English:\nWhen an iPhone receives a message that contains a phone number or an address -- e-mail, Web or street -- those bits of data are automatically highlighted, underlined and turned into clickable links. Click on the phone number, and the iPhone asks if you want to dial it. Click on the Web address, and it opens in Safari. Click on the street address, and Maps will display it.\nAs Gizmodo points out, this particular function could apply to a wide range of HTC phones: \" Droid Incredible, Evo 4G, T-Mobile G2, Nexus One and a bunch of older Android devices.\" But again, as HTC gleefully asserted, all it takes is a quick software update and the infringing problem goes away. However, the fact that Apple successfully won a ruling means that the software war will only continue. Everybody has their own idea of what this patent battle means, but the extent to which this latest case flipped from threat to ban to solution -- a span of a few days -- serves as a fresh reminder that the process is a little silly, if not a total waste of time.\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{{The LG G4 Android 6.0 Marshmallow update is moving along quick, with multiple regions and even US carriers offering it already, and more are coming soon. In fact, LG was the first manufacturer to release an update after Google unveiled Android 6.0, and today we have more details for owners of both the LG G3 and the LG G4.\nGoogle released the Android 6.0 Marshmallow software update back on October 5th, and the first non-Nexus device to receive an update was the LG G4 just three weeks later. We\u2019ve since watched it arrive for Sprint and US Cellular in the United States, and now Canada along with Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile could be next.\nRead: LG G4 Android 6.0 Update Problems & Fixes\nThe first LG G4 Android 6.0 update in the US was with Sprint, which surprisingly arrived in December ahead of all expectations. However, LG has yet to share details regarding other carriers, and carriers themselves, are silent as well. Below is some new information that should shed light on the situation for current owners.\nThose with the LG G3 and LG G4 know Android 6.0 Marshmallow is coming, but the question that remains is when. Sprint\u2019s release came with a few small details and a changelog, but that\u2019s it. Those with the LG G4 on AT&T, Verizon and more are still waiting, but a recent update from Canadian carrier TELUS could be revealing.\nThis week TELUS updated its Android 6.0 Marshmallow roadmap for a slew of devices, and added release dates for the LG G3 and LG G4. Owners can look forward to February 1st, and mid-March for the older LG G3. The release date image and more details can be found below.\nShown above, Canadian Carrier TELUS suggests the LG G4 Android 6.0 Marshmallow update will begin on February 1st, and the older LG G3 will be over a month later in the middle of March. Now this is only for one carrier outside of the US, but often times these update arrive in the United States first, especially with LG.\nGiven the fact that the LG G4 Android 6.0 update has already rolled out to two carriers in the United States (Sprint and US Cellular) other bigger carriers like AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile should be up next. None have made announcements or confirmed a date, but T-Mobile did release a roadmap last year with both smartphones on board.\nRead: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1 Lollipop: What\u2019s New in Marshmallow\nIt\u2019s worth noting that TELUS also has January release dates for the HTC One M8 and M9, which are on track for roughly the same weeks in the United States. If anything, this gives owners a rough idea of when to expect the update, but not an exact date. LG is working hard to deliver Android 6.0, and some users have experienced a few problems with it, which could be the cause for the delay on other carriers. LG may be making small tweaks before pushing it out to other carriers.\nThat being said, it looks like LG is close to delivering Android 6.0 Marshmallow for both the LG G3 and the newer LG G4 in the United States and Canada in the next few weeks. As soon as we know more or any announcements are made, we\u2019ll update with all the details.\n}}

Below we\u2019ll go into more details.\nOn October 5th Google officially released Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the successor to Android 5.1 Lollipop. It\u2019s loaded with new features, better performance, improved battery life and more. Less than a month later LG was the first major manufacturer to push out an update for small regions, and now in the US.\nRead: LG Android 6.0 Marshmallow Update Release Breakdown\nIn mid-December the Sprint LG G4 Android 6.0 Marshmallow update was officially announced, along with a small changelog, but most users still haven\u2019t received the update.

However, some users may want to hold off.\nNow that the update has hit two major carriers in the United States, not to mention a few LG G3 owners, we\u2019re starting to see an influx in reports that the update is doing more harm than good. Frustrating millions of LG G4 users, mainly on Sprint.\nIt was the first to receive the update, which may have been rushed, as we\u2019re seeing reboot problems, WiFi issues, no internet access, devices that won\u2019t go past the Android loading splash screen and more. This is a big issue, and we saw something similar with the LG G3 update to Android 4.4 KitKat that caused loads of problems.\nHeading to various Android forums it looks like the Sprint LG G4 Android 6.0 update was slowly rolled out, maybe even delayed, then continued to arrive but only caused issues for lots of owners. Many problems which, are also surfacing for the US Cellular update.\nWhile we\u2019ve had good luck with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the Nexus 5, Nexus 6P, and other devices, users with the LG G4 are reporting a slew of major issues.

This seems like a big problem, and users can expect an update in the near future with more fixes.\nThe link above is a detailed guide full of many problems users are experiencing, and potential fixes for some of those. The contact sync issue seems to be the biggest one, so we\u2019d recommend all users head to settings > accounts > their main Google account and make sure contact sync is enabled before the update. Then toggle it off and back on after the update, which should in turn make the phone sync and restore all contacts.\nAt the same time, other problems where the phone works fine for the first few days, then reboots, and gets stuck at the splash (loading) screen with the Android or Sprint logo, and it doesn\u2019t work further. If this is happening a full factory data reset may be required. If users can\u2019t boot into the phone, try booting into recovery and erasing everything. Of course this means you\u2019ll have to start fresh, but this is something I do with every big update, as it\u2019s the best route for a good experience to begin with.\nRead: How to Backup Android in 5 Easy Steps\nA last resort before heading to a Sprint (or other carrier store) for a replacement is heading into recovery mode and doing a factory data reset, then clearing the cache to delete remnants of the old software and update. Here\u2019s how:\nTurn off the LG G4. Then while off push and hold power and volume UP. Once the boot screen comes on keep holding. When the LG logo appears let go of power for one second then hold it down again. This should reboot the phone into \u201crecovery mode\u201d which users can use volume up\/down to navigate. Head to Wipe Cache, and use power to select. Try this first, and reboot. If this doesn\u2019t solve the problem, follow the same steps and do a \u201cfactory data reset\u201d in recovery.\nIf all else fails, some users may need to head to a Sprint store for a replacement.

{{Chinese consumer electronics maker Xiaomi is giving competing with Roku another shot: The company is preparing to release a new version of its Mi Box streaming device in the U.S., if a new FCC filing is any indication.

However, Nokia said that its Imaging SDK might appear on the Nokia X range \"when the time is right\".\nDuring an interview with The INQUIRER, Amit Patel, VP of developer relations at Nokia, said that the firm hopes to open the Imaging SDK to developers working on Nokia X apps, with imaging still a \"key differentiator\" for the firm.\nPatel said, \"On the hardware side, it's bill of materials, so you may not get a Nokia X handset with a 41MP camera. However, the important thing will be the software manipulation and imaging features, which is going to be something that we can bring down to the low end when the time is right.\n\"A lot of those software techniques are actually portable from the high end to the low end. If you've got a reasonable processor in the device, you can run a lot of those capabilities. Imaging is of course one of the key differentiators, not just on the Lumia side, but in the affordable smartphone space as well.\"\nDuring our interview, Patel also spoke about what developers can expect when submitting apps to the Nokia X Store, promising that the firm will carefully vet apps before they are approved. Thanks to this thorough apps validation process, he added that out of 100,000 Android apps tested for the Nokia X, nine percent were found to contain malware. \u00b5\n}}

{{Google has released the first beta of Android Q, the next version of its popular mobile operating system. Early adopters can get started by enrolling any Pixel device, including the original Pixel and Pixel XL. The search giant said a preview software development kit (SDK) is also available Wednesday for developers.\nAndroid Q brings \"a number of additional privacy and security features,\" Google said in a blog post, as well as new camera capabilities, faster app startup, enhancements for foldable devices, and more.\nIf you want help on how-to install the Android Q beta check out this story on CNET.\nNow playing: Watch this: Android Q preview: What's new in beta?\nFoldable screen support\nAndroid Q lets developers manage how their app is displayed on foldable and large screens. This includes everything from how apps are resized to how apps are muted when not active.\nGoogle\nJPEG + Dynamic Depth\nMany phones have a portrait mode that blurs the background of a subject in a photo. The depth-mapping data used to create the effect is discarded after the photo is rendered. Dynamic Depth will allow apps to use that depth data to offer specialized blurs and bokeh options. Developers can also use Dynamic Depth data to create 3D images and AR photography.\nHDR10+\nThe new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus were the first phones to feature HDR10+ a high dynamic range format for displays. Android Q has HDR10+ for phones and tablets that support it. Android Q will also be able to handle AV1 a video codec that allows for higher quality streaming video that uses less bandwidth.\nFaster app launches\nSince Nougat, opening apps has gotten faster as Android learned which parts of an apps code is used frequently. Now with Android Q, Google apps can launch immediately. Developers can use Android Q to process app data earlier and then move it to a security container, so it's ready to launch.\nImproved connectivity\nAndroid Q improves connections to IoT devices like smart appliances and printers. This can be especially helpful when managing connected devices.\nSetting panels for apps\nThere's no need for you to leave an to make adjustments. You can manage settings from a floating settings panel that offers up specific functions used by the app you're in. For example, Google Chrome's display panel might have connectivity settings like Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi and data.\nGoogle\nPrivacy protections\nYou'll have more control over apps and their access to shared files. This is one of the biggest updates to Android. You can also control an app's access to the Photos and Videos. For Downloads, you can decide which Download files an app can access.\nLimit location sharing\nYou have more control over location settings and permissions. When prompted to give apps permission to see your location you can choose: never, only when the app is running, or all the time -- even in the background. So if you are using a ride share app you can let it track your location while it's in use, but forbid the app accessing your location data when not.\nFaster sharing shortcuts\nDevelopers will be able to publish targets in the Sharing Shortcuts interface in advance, which allows them to load instantly when launched by a user.\nGoogle\nWi-Fi performance mode\nAndroid Q offers high-performance and low-latency modes for wireless connections. This will be a boon for real-time gaming and improved voice calls.\nApp security\nAndroid Q provides more support for passive authentication like face ID. It also adds specific flows for implicit and explicit authentication. Android Q updates transport layer security to TLS 1.3, which Google claims can establish a secured connection 40 percent faster than TLS 1.2.\nUp-to-date Android apps\nTo allow apps to have the most current security and performance features, Android Q will warn you when it installs a new app targeting Android Marshmallow or older. This summer the Google Play store will require all apps to have 64-bit support.\nThe company said it'll have more to share about Android Q at Google I\/O in May.\n}}

{{While there have been hopes that Google would have released or at least unveiled the long awaited Android Key Lime Pie operating system by now, it has become obvious that we will be getting another version of Jelly Bean first. Before it has even been revealed officially we have news of the Android 4.3 SuperSU root by Chainfire.\nWe have already seen the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean software out in the wild working on devices already, and the leaked Android 4.3 firmware has already been rooted before Google has even made the operating system official.\nThe root works on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Edition that has the Android 4.3 OS that leaked previously with the build number of JWR66N.S005.130625, and according to XDA Developer Chainfire is the first Android 4.3 root that is available.\nIt is not currently clear that the protections that are in place are defaults of the Android 4.3 firmware or the work of Samsung, but the root needed quite a few mods to SuperSU. All of the features are working so if you are the owner of the Galaxy S4 it will be pleasing to learn that the Android 4.3 leak can also be rooted.\nObviously installing such software to your handset is done at your own risk and only attempt to do so if you are confident in doing such things, and you must make sure you back up all your data first. The full instructions and links to the software needed can be found here.\n}}

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\nBy Foo Yun Chee and Paresh Dave\nBRUSSELS\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google will charge hardware firms up to $40 per device to use its apps under a new licensing system to replace one that the European Union this year deemed anti-competitive, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nThe new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google\u2019s Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.\nThe fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added.\nCompanies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by placing Google\u2019s search and Chrome internet browser in a prominent position. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.\nTech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents.\nThe European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.\nThe new system should give Google\u2019s rivals such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) more room to partner with hardware makers to become the default apps for search and browsing, analysts said.\nQwant, a small French search company that has been critical of Google, said in a statement on Friday that it was \u201csatisfied that the European Commission\u2019s action pushed Google to finally give manufacturers the possibility to offer such choices to consumers.\u201d\n}}

{{Turntable.fm is the social media website that allows its users to interactively share music, and today we have the news that turntable.fm for Android finally arrives to the Google Play Store, so Android users can be virtual DJs wherever they may be going.\nFor those of you that may have never heard of it turntable.fm is a music service where users become DJs in virtual clubs, and as GottaBe Mobile are reporting each room can have between one and five DJs with around 200 listeners. The DJs look to gain points by trying to get other users to give their songs the thumbs-up, but if too many users give the song the thumbs-down the song will be skipped.\nAs users gain more points they can upgrade their avatars, but other than that the idea is for DJs to play the music they love. The service is legal as it has struck deals with all the major music labels, and the Android application brings most of the functionality of the desktop version.\nThere is a chat function included in the app, but it does seem to be a little buggy on some devices, which will hopefully be addressed in future updates. There is one standout feature that is missing from the app though, which is the ability to open the current track in services like Rdio and Spotify, and the only option is to purchase the tracks via Amazon MP3.\nAnother feature missing from the app is the ability to view the previous tracks that DJs played in a room, which is normally useful for potential DJs to get a feel for the room but is only currently available in the desktop version of the service.\nTo find out more and to download turntable.fm head over to Google Play.

{{WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday closely questioned Google\u2019s claim that Oracle does not enjoy copyright protection over certain parts of the Java programming language.\nGoogle's Android 4.3 operating system, is announced to be installed in the new Nexus 7 tablet, during a Google event at Dogpatch Studio in San Francisco, California, July 24, 2013. REUTERS\/Beck Diefenbach\nThe issue, under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, is being closely watched by software developers in Silicon Valley.\nGoogle\u2019s Android operating system is the world\u2019s best-selling smartphone platform. The Java programming language was created by Sun Microsystems, which Oracle acquired in 2010. Oracle sued Google later that year, claiming that Google had improperly incorporated parts of Java into Android.\nOracle President and Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz, who took the stand during trial last year, appeared in court on Wednesday to hear the appellate arguments. She declined to comment outside the courtroom. Google attorney Robert Van Nest also declined to comment.\nThe case examined whether computer language that connects programs - known as application programming interfaces, or APIs - can be copyrighted.\nAt trial in San Francisco last year, Oracle claimed Google\u2019s Android tramples on its rights to the structure of 37 Java APIs. Oracle sought roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims.\nGoogle argued that Oracle cannot copyright the structure of Java, an open-source or publicly available software language. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that the Java APIs replicated by Google were not subject to copyright protection and free for all to use.\nOracle appealed. At the hearing on Wednesday, Federal Circuit Judge Kathleen O\u2019Malley questioned whether Alsup\u2019s ruling meant Google could similarly use APIs from companies like Apple or Microsoft.\n\u201cThis would apply to every possible computer program out there,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\nGoogle attorney Robert Van Nest said that was true, but that Google still cannot copy actual source code from competitors. Google spent over two years and millions of dollars writing source code for Android, Van Nest said.\n\u201cFifteen million lines of Android source code were original,\u201d Van Nest said.\nThe trial in San Francisco attracted widespread attention, as Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and Google CEO Larry Page both testified. Alsup deferred his legal ruling about the copyrightability of Java APIs until after a jury had heard evidence on other issues in dispute.\nThe jury deadlocked on whether Google had fairly used the Java APIs, which Alsup then decided weren\u2019t subject to copyright anyway.\nAt the appeals court argument on Wednesday, O\u2019Malley and Judge Richard Taranto said two of the main legal precedents cited by Google were not relevant to the issue of whether Java APIs could be copyrighted.\nOracle attorney Joshua Rosenkranz asked the appeals court to rule that Java APIs were subject to copyright, and that Google was not entitled to a fair use defense.\nHowever, Van Nest said if the Federal Circuit decides that copyright applies to the APIs, a second jury should consider fair use.\nThe three judge Federal Circuit panel did not say when it would issue a ruling.\nThe case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Oracle America Inc vs. Google Inc, 13-1021.\n}}

{{Phones are becoming a link between people that extends beyond just basic voice communication. Stored on phones are items that are so crucial and so private that many of us do not even realize it. From text messages explaining intimate details of our lives, including family and relationship issues, to financial data, the phone is becoming a record of all that is important to our personal and professional functioning.\nFor that reason, it becomes so important to arm ourselves with the right protections. If you have an Android using telephone, the following are three tips on securing your mobile device and protecting it from hackers and information stealers.\nBe Responsible\nPart of securing your phone will be up to you and your habits. You need to provide yourself with the best possible protection and that starts with changing your current usage patterns on your phone. One way that you can do this is by training yourself to clear your past usage and website history.\nThis is important because cookies and other tracking links can be invisibly attached to your device through these website links and unknowingly, your information can be taken because of where you have been.\nThe same extension should be given to your passwords as well. Make sure that you do not save your passwords on your device because that means anyone that has access to your phone could use it to access sensitive information. Be sure that all of your website passwords are removed after you are finished with the site such as and this will serve as an added protection for you while you use your network capabilities on your Android phone.\nDownload Restrictively\nThere are many great and safe applications available for Android phones and devices, but computer support experts say that there are also many applications that are not safe and secure. These applications seek to serve one purpose and one purpose only: to gain access to your phone. For that reason, you need to make sure that you download restrictively and with research. Just because an application seems interesting, does not mean you should bring it onto your phone. Instead consider where the application is coming from, who the publisher is, and what other consumers are saying about it. Certain applications with less than ideal intentions can clear and pull data from phone just seconds after you have downloaded so be sure to do your research.\nSecurity Applications\nThough you should download with thought and with discernment, there are great applications out there that can enhance security rather than hinder it. Android applications offer several that are meant to protect your phone from threats. Among the most basic are those that work to password protect the screen or access to certain applications once in the device. These can be very useful not only when your phone is with you and may fall into the wrong hands but also if you ever lose your device randomly.\nThere are also applications that will help you to accomplish the development of the personal habits listed above. These applications will clear history for you automatically and clear passwords as well. Both of these styles of applications can be used individually or in conjunction with one another.\nFurther, many great Android security enhancements are free to the user which means that anyone with an Android phone can get some level of protection. Some may be more enhanced but only offered at a fee. This is usually nominal and may be very well worth it in seeking complete protection of your Android phone. Choose wisely and research and this will help you to get the security that you need and deserve.\n}}

{{Alina Bradford\/CNET\nIf you've got an Android and use the default keyboard, you can get rid of autocorrect words that you would never say or misspelled words that your keyboard has learned over time. All you need to do is take out the trash.\nFirst, check to make sure you have the 5.0 update or better. Go to Message+ and open it. In the upper left side, tap on the Menu icon and select About from the menu. A screen will pop up and tell you what version of the app you have. If it's 5.0 or higher, you're golden.\nNow, pop on over to a text message conversation. Autocorrect learns from what you type. So, if you constantly misspell a word it will think that is what you want and will put the word in its dictionary.\nWhenever you autocorrect tells you to misspell something, tap on the suggested word and drag it upward. A trashcan icon will appear at this point. Just continue to drag the offending word over to the trash can icon and release it. That word will be deleted and will never come back...unless you teach your autocorrect that word again.\nWhile this works with the default keyboard on all types of Android phones, it may not work if you are using third-party keyboards. For example, on SwiftKey you can drag a word up to remove it, but the trashcan icon won't appear. You'll just get a pop-up asking you if you would like to remove the word from the dictionary.\nThis is particularly handy for those of us with salty language. I will never say \"duck\" in conversation, even though autocorrect is constantly telling me I should. Finally, I got tired of the motherly advice and chunked duck in the trash. Now I am able to cuss freely. Take that, autocorrect.\n}}

{{The well-documented wait for the BBM service for Android and iOS devices is creating a fair amount of attention at the moment. Many people are eager to start using BBM cross-platform, and we know from the many comments we\u2019ve received that the release can\u2019t come soon enough for some. However, is it the case that the BBM app for Android and iOS could simply complicate things?\nBlackBerry has promised the BBM app for iOS and Android by the end of September, and there have been several false starts and fake apps leading people to think it has already arrived. Android and iOS BlackBerry Messenger beta user guides with features recently emerged that seemed to indicate we were a step closer to the launch of the apps on Google Play and the App Store.\nWhile we wait though, it\u2019s given us time to wonder if BBM for Android and iOS is simply too late. BlackBerry is going through struggling times, and some reports recently suggested that BBM is one of the only real assets the company has left. However, if the Android and iOS apps had been released much sooner, BBM on those platforms could already have established its place in the market. Instead, it will have to compete against alternative messaging apps such as WeChat and WhatsApp.\nThe other thing to consider is that BBM for Android or iOS could just confuse the picture further. Phone Dog makes a good point when discussing this matter, noting that when BBM was first launched it created a unique niche in communication tools. However, in 2011 Apple introduced iMessage for the iOS platform, and Android and Windows Phone platforms both have their own instant messaging software.\nNot only do users have these services, but many app alternatives on different platforms also exist. Two of these are WeChat and WhatsApp as we mentioned earlier, but also Facebook Messenger, TextMe, Hangouts and more. If you have a large circle of friends and acquaintances all using different messaging services, rather than making communication easier it can simply become more complicated.\nWith many smartphone plans now including text messaging, BBM is not as pertinent as it once was, and we wonder if it will prove as popular as many people seem to think. BBM for Android and iOS is clearly not too much further away now, but we feel it may not be as relevant as it would have done if BlackBerry had introduced it far earlier.\nIt would be interesting to hear what you think though. Are you waiting for the Android and iOS BBM apps to arrive? Perhaps you feel BBM is long overdue for these platforms, and you prefer to use another service? Let us know by sending your comments.\n}}

{{A very interesting acquisition announcement from Twitter today: it\u2019s buying Cover, an Android lockscreen app that lets you customise what apps you see and when. For now, Cover will remain live in the Play store.\n\u201cIf that changes down the road, we\u2019ll provide another update here,\u201d the founders Todd Jackson, Gordon Luk and Edward Ho note in a blog post announcing the deal.\nYou can read Josh\u2019s review of how Cover works here.\nCover is being somewhat cryptic in discussing what it will be working on at Twitter. \u201cTwitter, like Cover, believes in the incredible potential of Android,\u201d they write. \u201cThey share our vision that smartphones can be a lot smarter \u2014 more useful and more contextual \u2014 and together we\u2019re going to make that happen. We\u2019ll be building upon a lot of what makes Cover great, and we\u2019re thrilled to create something even better at Twitter.\u201d\nAt the same time, when you consider the work that Facebook has done in developing its Home service around the Android lockscreen, it\u2019s clear that on some level, if an app is not owning the SIM that controls the entire phone, or the operating system, this is one very obvious way to remain front of mind for a user and incorporate a series of services that become front and center features for a user.\nApps are an overcrowded game. So owning the lockscreen gives you, effectively, a place to be first in the queue. It also gives Twitter some interesting potential routes for how it might longer-term try to deliver its stream of followers\u2019 new and messages outside of its own app. Widgets featuring Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other streams are already quite common; Cover could work on ways to formalise and improve that experience.\nIt\u2019s an area that others are eyeing up, too: Yahoo earlier this year acquired Aviate, which helps users customise their Android homescreens, for reportedly $80 million.\nOne question that lingers for me is how, when, and if companies like Twitter (and Facebook) will ever be able to think about these problems in the same way on iOS.\nMore generally, mobile has become a huge business for Twitter.

{{Clear Channel Radio already had mobile applications for iPhone, BlackBerry and Chumby devices, but today it\u2019s adding an Android version to the line-up.\nNot that there\u2019s a lack of decent radio streaming applications on well, any platform these days, but here goes: Clear Channel Radio\u2019s iheartradio app gives users free access to some 350 American radio stations, including a couple of artist-hosted stations from the likes of Christina Aguilera, Megadeth, Eagles and Weezer.\nThe app also enables you to get \u2018frequently updated\u2019 traffic reports for large markets including New York, L.A., Chicago, San Francisco and Houston.\nLike its iPhone \/ iPod Touch sister, the iheartradio app for Android can be configured to automatically start playing a specific station upon launch, includes artwork and lyrics and also enables users to tag songs for purchase on iTunes.\nTo download the free app, simply log on to Android Market from your handset (Android v1.5 or higher).\nUpdate: the app seems to have disappeared from Android Market. Kinda puts a downer on the drum-banging efforts.\nUpdate 2: And it\u2019s back!\n}}

{{Google\nUnless you're an Android developer deciding your next strategic programming move, chances are your brain isn't attuned to the distribution of operating systems among all Android smartphone owners.\nHowever, Google's periodic pie charts and stacked line graphs reveal some interesting data nuggets, at least for Android fanatics.\nAccording to data collected from July 1 to July 15, just about 60 percent of all Android smartphone owners are running version 2.0 of the Android operating system or higher, with 55 percent of the data set concentrated on version 2.1. (We'll go out on a limb to guess that of that number, 100 percent of those 2.1 users are hotly anticipating getting the 2.2 over-the-air update.)\nCompare this OS 2.1 figure to the merely 3.3 percent of Android users who have already received the version 2.2 OS update, and the 40 percent still stuck in pre-2.0 limbo on older or midrange devices.\nWhat really stands out when you flipping the statistic along the pre- and post- 2.0 OS line is that 40 percent of users running OS 1.5 and 1.6 are missing out on key Android features, including pinch-to-zoom, universal voice search, and a much more powerful Google Maps app with personalized search suggestions.\nThe figures will certainly soon shift again as more 2.1 phones migrate from \"Eclair\" to \"Froyo\" (2.2), but even then, the number of users running version 2.0 and above will still remain just over half until the next waves of Android phones on the latest OS begin to saturate the market, replacing older phones mired in older OS versions.\n[Via Boy Genius Report]\nArticle correted at 5:20pm PT.

{{Sony Ericsson's Xperia Arc and Xperia Play will waltz into the land of Android 2.3.3 next week, reports Recombu.\nAssuming that UK mobile networks approve, users should see their handsets ready for upgrade very soon. As always, there may be a variation in exactly when the update rolls out. All that should be solved with the Ice Cream Sandwich release later in the year. For now, keep an eye on your phone -- it'll tell you when it's ready.\nThose with a need to share the minutiae of their lives on Facebook should be pleased to learn that the update brings them Facebook Inside Experia. This includes the ability to 'like' the music currently playing on your phone (which posts it to your wall with a link to Sony's TrackID music service), upload your snapped photos, synchronise your Facebook calendar to your phone and Google account, and link your contacts to Facebook profiles.\nFacebook inside Xperia will wend its way on to all other Xperia phones, including the Neo, mini and mini pro, by the end of the year. The feature can be selectively turned off if you're concerned that everything you do ends up on your wall. We've spent enough time worrying about Android data thieves without facing the smorgasbord of Facebook and Sony privacy issues all at once.\nThe head of Web service partnerships at Sony Ericsson, Calum MacDougall, said the plan was to \"enrich the experience\" of using the Xperia phones alongside Facebook, with new features being added over time, rather than replacing the functionality of the Facebook app.\nPresumably we can now all look forward to frantic, non-stop wall postings and an increased need to use the 'hide' button.\n}}

{{The TCL-made BlackBerry KEYone might be one of the world\u2019s most secure (and productive) Android smartphones, but 15 full months after its commercial release, the QWERTY keyboard\/touchscreen hybrid still runs the software platform\u2019s Nougat flavor.\nAt least officially and as far as the vast majority of users are concerned, because a small minority can now sample an early, possibly unstable version of Oreo. We know, it\u2019s a little late to kick off Android 8.0 (or even 8.1) beta testing, especially when talking about a respectable mid-range handset with a decent Snapdragon 625 processor and up to 4GB RAM.\nFurthermore, since the KEY2 has been recently released powered by Android 8.1 Oreo out the box, that means the number of Nougat-based BlackBerry-branded devices upgraded to the newest OS iteration is zero.\nWorst of all, a Canadian carrier led us to believe the official software update would begin rolling out over-the-air a couple of weeks ago, which was obviously not the case. But perhaps the KEYone\u2019s invitation-only Oreo beta program is just a formality to check for last-minute bugs, and the tests will wrap up soon\u2026 enough.\nBy the way, members of the BlackBerry Beta Zone are being moved to a new BlackBerry Beta Community, where these invites are currently available, so if you want to help stabilize this particular update, as well as similar efforts in the future, make sure you join the latter group.\n}}

{{The Sony Xperia Z4 and Z5 are confirmed to be receiving an Android 6.0 Marshmallow update after a Wi-Fi certification was spotted for the mobile operating system upgrade for the Sony-built handset and tablet.\nThe Wi-Fi certification is shown in the Wi-Fi Alliance website, revealing some Japanese handset models that have been approved for Android 6.0 Marshmallow firmware upgrades. Wi-Fi certification is one of the many steps to getting a smartphone ready for an OS update, which approves a gadget for Wi-Fi interoperability, security and a range of other application-specific protocols.\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow is now Wi-Fi certified for the Sony Xperia Z5 on NTT docomo (SO-01H), SoftBank (501SO) and au (SOV32), and NTT docomo Xperia Z5 Premium (SO-03H). The Xperia Z4 tablet on NTT docomo (SO-03G), SoftBank (402SO) and au (SOV31) have also received Wi-Fi certifications.\nAndroid device owners have long been on the lookout for any signs that would confirm the arrival of an OTA update of the Android 6.0 Marshmallow mobile operating system. The firmware update, though not as major as Lollipop, promises a wide variety of new features and upgrades including a new Doze Mode, a smart standby system that is seen to bring improvements to battery life.\nOther upgrades include access to Android Pay, enhanced systems for fingerprint scanners, improved user experience designs and many more.\nThe Xperia Z5 is Sony's latest flagship handset that sports a 5.2-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution. The smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810, and has 3 GB of RAM. DxO Mark gives the Xperia Z5's camera a score of 87, one of the highest mobile photo and video scores to date.\nThe Xperia Z4 tablet, on the other hand, is Sony's latest tablet release, and sports a 10.1-inch screen with a 2560x1600 pixel display.\nThe Wi-Fi certification provides no set date as to when the Sony Xperia Z4 and Z5, neither does it imply that the update will be arriving soon, but users can expect to hear more from Sony by the time the new year comes.\n}}

{{The Apple Watch is looming on the horizon, but that hasn't stopped one man from tweaking his Moto 360...\nMohammed Abu-Garbeyyeh is a developer, and he has just cracked the code. This isn't cryptology of Turing proportions, granted - actually, it probably isn't cryptology at all - but getting iOS notifications to display on Android Wear is still pretty impressive.\nNot that it's something that both Google and Apple are against. Apple's decision not to make iOS compatible with Android Wear seems logical enough given its own smartwatch ambitions, but Google is far more open. Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang said recently that, \"we always want as many users as possible to enjoy our experience.\"\n\"In terms of enabling more people to use Android Wear we're very interested in making [cross-platform support] happen.\"\nAbu-Garbeyyeh hasn't revealed exactly how he got the hack to work, but we do know that it used the same ANCS (Apple Notification Centre Service) technology as Pebble's smartwatches, and that he didn't need to jailbreak iOS or root Android Wear to get it running.\nIf you're thinking of having a go yourself, or picking up an Android Wear watch on this basis, just hold on a second. This code will probably never be available, and if you manage to recreate it, you'll be locked out of Google Play and Google Now, natch. Still, it's cool to know what's possible.\n}}

{{Share\nGoogle, the Open Handset Alliance, and a host of mobile technology companies including Samsung, T-Mobile, Motorola, Intel , Asus, Sony Ericsson, Toshiba, Vodafone, Qualcomm, and SiRF plus many others have all been sued for breach of trademark for using the word \"Android.\" Android, of course, is Google open source mobile operating system\u2014which is increasingly looking like it might make the leap to netbooks and other devices besides phones. One problem with that, though: Sprecht runs a small software development and ISP out of Palatine, Illinois, under the name Android Data. And he had the foresight to trademark the name, applying for trademark protection in 2000, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granting the trademark in 2002.\nGoogle applied for its Android trademark in October 2007 just before publicly announcing Android, and had their trademark application rejected due to possible confusion with Sprecht\u2019s trademark. Google attempted to appeal the decision, arguing that Android Data Corporation had apparently dissolved in May 2004 (though it was later reactivated) and that the company hadn\u2019t even bothered to keep its domain registration active. However, the USPTO didn\u2019t buy it, and repeatedly rejected Google\u2019s appealed before suspending Google\u2019s trademark application last November.\nNow, Sprecht has apparently realized Google\u2019s Android is software product, not a specific mobile device, and has rushed to protect his trademark. Sprecht is seeking an injunction on the sale of Android-branded products in the United States and some $94 million in damages for trademark infringement.\nA Google spokesperson has said that the company believes Sprecht\u2019s claims are without merit, and that the company intends to defend itself against them.\nSprecht\u2019s trademark does not extend to any use of the word Android, but only as it applies to computer hardware and software in an \"International Class 009\" trademark application. The fundamentals of the case will likely revolve around the type of trademark sought and will potentially involve Sprecht\u2019s registration of the word \"data\" along with Android; Sprecht indicated the word was merely descriptive and that \"Android\" was the most significant term in his trademark application.\n}}

{{At this year\u2019s I\/O, in lieu of splashy reveals, Google is announcing some minor tools for developers, including a way to show bird\u2019s eye map views in their smartwatch apps. The company also revealed that it has 5,000 true watch apps in the Google Play Store, plus 1,500 custom watch faces. This year\u2019s conference is mainly a time to reflect, and convince app makers that Android Wear is ready to compete with the Apple Watch.\nLast week, I talked with Jeff Chang, Android Wear\u2019s lead product manager, along with a couple other members of the team. As Android Wear approaches its first birthday, here\u2019s what the company has learned, and what its next steps will be.\nAndroid Wear, like most other smartwatches, depends on a smartphone for most of its functions. But Google has realized that it needs to carve out exceptions. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to throw their phones away, but almost everyone is away from their phone for some period of time during the day, whether that\u2019s at the gym, at home, or at the office,\u201d Chang says.\nWe definitely believe in a future where these devices can be used without a phone.\nChang points to several features that Google has added since last fall: Google Play Music users can now store songs on the watch for listening through Bluetooth headphones, and watches with GPS can track more detailed workouts on their own. An update this month also turns on the Wi-Fi chips that had been dormant in most Android Wear watches. This lets users sync data from their phones over the Internet, even when they\u2019re out of Bluetooth range or on an entirely different Wi-Fi network.\n\u201cI would say, you\u2019ll see us continue to prioritize that kind of stuff, in terms of letting your watch do things regardless of where your phone is, and letting apps run directly on the watch without a phone component,\u201d Chang says. \u201cWe definitely believe in a future where these devices can be used without a phone, some of the time or all of the time,\u201d Chang says.\n\u201cA lot of people on the team would predict, \u2018Oh, such and such watch that we\u2019re launching, that\u2019ll definitely be the one that everyone likes, and this one\u2019s ugly, and this and that,\u2019\u201d Chang says. But it turns out that everyone has a different opinion on what\u2019s fashionable. \u201cEssentially, I\u2019ve given up trying to predict which styles or shapes would be popular and which wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he says.\n}}

{{Google has said that many of the patents at issue in the fight between Samsung and Apple do not relate to the \"core\" Android operating system.\nThe search giant, however, suggested that many of today's innovations are built upon technology that was created years ago.\n\"The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office. The mobile industry is moving fast and all players - including newcomers - are building upon ideas that have been around for decades. We work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don't want anything to limit that.\"\nGoogle's statement comes several days after a jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion (\u00a3665 million) after it found Samsung guilty of infringing on several Apple-held patents. Given that Samsung's line-up is largely devoted to Android-based devices, many wondered how the verdict would affect Android going forward.\nAt this point, the verdict only includes damages, but Apple plans to ask for product bans at a 20 September follow-up hearing. In a 24 August order, Judge Lucy Koh gave Apple a deadline to submit a one-page chart that identifies the products it wishes to ban in the US.\n\"Depending on the scope of Apple's preliminary injunction request, the Court may continue the briefing and hearing schedule on Apple's preliminary injunction motion,\" Judge Koh wrote.\nApple already succeeded in having the Galaxy Tab 10.1 banned in the US ahead of trial. In a more recent filing, however, Samsung argued that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 ban should be lifted since the jury found that Samsung did not infringe on Apple's iPad design patent with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - one of Samsung's only victories in the case.\n}}

{{Yep HTC seems to be flooding the market with Android powered smartphones these days and have now launched yet another Android Gingerbread smartphone in South Korea called the HTC Raider 4G, and we have the details on the new HTC built handset.\nAccording to the guys over on Android Community, HTC has only launched the HTC Raider 4G for South Korea, so it is unclear if the Android smartphone will become available in any other market although the rumour is the device will be heading for AT&T at some point in the future.\nSo here\u2019s what the HTC Raider 4G offers a 4.5-inch qHD IPS touch screen, the same 1.5GHz dual core processor as the HTC Sensation XE, along with and 8 megapixel rear facing camera with dual LED flash, and 1.3 megapixel front facing camera, and HD video recording.\nOther specs include the usual WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, 1GB RAM, 16GB internal storage, LTE upload speeds of 50Mbps and download of up to 100Mbps, 3G at 5.76Mbps uploads and up to 20Mbps downloads, and all running nicely on the Android Gingerbread OS along with HTC Sense.\nThe HTC Raider 4G measures 128.8 x 67 x 11.27mm, packs a 1620mAh battery and weighs in at 163.8 grams, and apparently HTC will offer an optional DMB dongle with the HTC Raider 4G in South Korea for those wishing to watch digital TV.\nWhen it comes to pricing there\u2019s currently no word on just how much the HTC Raider 4G will command and as I said earlier, no concrete word on if the device will see the light of day in other markets, but as soon as we hear more we will of course pass it along.\n}}

{{Starting with Metropolis and continuing all the way up through Her, filmmakers have spent more than a century probing the fundamental question of what makes us human, especially when so many of the essential qualities can be artificially replicated. That's why Ex Machina, out in theaters April 10, hits hard. It leaves you with that satisfied feeling of a slightly unsatisfying conclusion, and dozens of questions about what technology does to us.\nConsider robots we've known, or at least heard of, be they real or fiction. C-3PO, Wall-E, the ELIZA program\u2014all of them can get an emotional response from us, but the visible metal and silicon mean we never forget they're not human. In this movie, we have robots that are approaching replicant territory: the lead machine has the physical form to make the audience (and the characters) think of her as human. The problem is that this convincing design is still a human construct, and specifically a male one. When a man is given the chance to create a nearly perfect human facsimile, all sorts of unsavory desires come to mind.\nAlmost human\nThe plot of Ex Machina follows 24-year-old Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a coder who ostensibly wins a contest to visit his company's founder, billionaire Nathan Bateman. (He's played by Oscar Isaac, a talent whom you'll see in the next Star Wars.) The film takes place on Nathan's remote compound, a connected fortress with surveillance in every corner. After signing a nondisclosure agreement, Caleb is nominally a guest there, but with the copious security and eerie atmosphere, he's left unsure about how he might escape.\nAt his remote compound, Nathan shows Caleb a secret project named is Ava. She's a human-like amalgamation of motors and software that make her uncannily convincing, despite visible wires and motors. This isn't some dystopia filled with replicants and terminators. Ex Machina isn't even in a near-future. The work going on in Nathan's compound feels barely beyond the research that you can imagine taking place behind the doors of some Google or SpaceX secret skunkworks division.\nThe most alarming fact about Ava: Nathan got the data for her facial expressions from unsuspecting smartphone users. Fun fact: human skin is so elastic and has so many muscles that fitting enough actuators to mimic human emotion is currently almost impossible. But that's what's been said about every advancement in the last few decades.\nYou can imagine the work taking place behind the doors of some Google secret skunkworks division\nAva is, by director Alex Garland's design, unsettlingly convincing, right down to her comely figure containing her circuits. While seducing Caleb, it's clear that her creator, Nathan, sees robots as servile creatures. And thanks to actress Alicia Vikander's countenance, it's hard to not see her as a victim of Nathan's dominance. After meeting Ava, Caleb questions his allegiances. You see what he sees, including Ava's first appearance as an elegant mess of wires and audible motors, but with an angelic face. When she puts on a dress and wig, she's alluring, even seductive.\nRobot love\nGarland's resume contains some of the most brilliant sci-fi franchises of the last decade. He was a screenwriter and then producer for 28 Days and 28 Weeks Later, screenwriter for the 2008 Danny Boyle-directed Sunshine, and screenwriter\/producer for Dredd. This is his first director credit, and the strengths of those movies, particularly the slow-burn suspense of 28 Days Later, are here.\nIt's astounding that Ex Machina film was made on a budget of just $15 million because the visuals and airtight shot sequences look like, and I mean this in the best way, Michael Bay-caliber. Beyond the visuals, the subtle touches, like Portishead's Geoff Barrow contributing to the soundtrack, create an atmosphere that prepares you for the paranoia.\nAs the movie goes on, it becomes clear that Nathan has paid attention to outfitting his robots to satisfy base male desires. When a seemingly guileless Ava tells Caleb of how Nathan treats her, Caleb feels understandingly sympathetic. There's some inevitable romance, too (see Spike Jonez's Her for more on human\/robot love) that develops between Caleb and Ava, all colored by this constant question of what is necessary to trigger our interpersonal receptors.\nLike most good movies, Ex Machina leaves you with questions rather than answers about the ultimate conclusion of AI, but the big ideas never come at the expense of entertainment value. At a comparatively tight 1 hour and 47 minutes, Ex Machina packs in suspense and appropriately stunning visual effects that combine to make a brilliant sci-fi movie. It'll make you want to sit down with Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk and hear more about why they're so wary of artificial intelligence.\n}}

{{As far back as 2008, companies like Symantec warned that Android\u2019s comparative openness made it more vulnerable than competing mobile operating systems like iOS. Now, however, Symantec has taken another look at Android and iOS and reached a rather different conclusion this time around. According to the new study, iOS is currently saddled wth 182 more security vulnerabilities than Android.\nMost of those, says Symantec\u2019s Carey Nachenberg, are lower-severity flaws. The remaining \u201chandful,\u201d however, are far more serious \u2014 allowing carte blanche access to a compromised device\u2019s data and services. There was, of course, a rather nasty iPhone worm a couple years ago which made headlines by pilfering bank account details from users, though its impact was rather limited since only jailbroken devices were vulnerable. Ultimately, however, iOS fares better than Android in Symantec\u2019s overall analysis.\nAs you\u2019d expect, Symantec gives Apple the thumbs up for its app approval system and casts a stern glare at Google, whose current Android app vetting process has allowed many a trojanized application to appear in the official Android Market in recent months. Apple also receives high marks for the way user data is encrypted, protection Android users don\u2019t enjoy out-of-the-box unless they happen to be using a Honeycomb-powered tablet.\nSymantec proceeds to point out, for some reason, that iOS is \u201cimmune to traditional types of viruses and worms.\u201d That probably has a lot to do with the fact that iOS can\u2019t run desktop application code, which is how most malware has been programmed thus far. Android, too, should be given props for this kind of \u201cimmunity.\u201d\nOne area where both iOS and Android came up short according to Symantec: social engineering attacks. This seems more than a bit unfair, since social engineering attacks \u2014 by their very nature \u2014 actually compromise the person using the device and not the devices themselves. The human operating system is far more difficult to harden than a regular mobile OS.\nRead more at Symantec, V3\n}}

{{If you are into your vintage cars and would love to learn more about restoration tips, then think about these two apps for iOS and Android devices.\nThe app is called \u201cVintage Cars\u201d and is about restoration tips from a classic car junkie, the iOS app has been developed by AppWarrior and the Android version by KoolAppz, both apps are the same but just for different operating systems.\nEveryone has their personal favourite when it comes to cars; almost all car lovers love vintage cars. There are mint condition vintage cars out there, but most need a little loving care and attention and this is where these apps come into play.\nBringing the old car back to life again is the key to a sexy and stunning model; get the renovation love in motion and bringing something old back to life.\nThese apps give many tips on restoring a classic car, plus great information via websites and clubs. You can display the car and in return get help by other members.\nDo you want the car to simply run, or would you prefer to get it back to manufacturer\u2019s specifications, we personally like the latter. This is a book guide application that can teach you about different types of vintage cars, what you need to restore it and where to find the parts.\nThe book chapters include: Vintage Car Restoration, Things You Need, Before You Begin, Types Of Cars To Restore, Interior Restoration, Body Restoration, Mechanical Restoration, Accessories, Electrical Components, Reassembly, Where To Get Help, Care Of Your Restored Car, Professional Car Restoration, Car Shows, Where To Get Parts, Twenty Quick Tips For Car Junkies, Top Websites For Car Junkies and The Car Is Yours.\nIf you have an iOS device then please install \u201cVintage Cars\u201d via iTunes (App Store), for Android users please visit the Android Market.\nWe would love to know what vintage car you have, are you working on it now or are you thinking about it?\nA little history about vintage cars: Vintage cars are normally built around 1920 to 1930, basically around World War I time. It is not too sure the exact date a car becomes a vintage one, it is the same as the end date, in Britain it is around 1930 and in America it is around 1925. These dates define the pre-classic car period, you have only got to visit the Classic Car Club of America to see their dates. Now if it is the end of WW2 then that date is 1945.\n}}

{{Enterprise mobile software company Enterproid, which lets Android device owners split their phone between business and personal profiles with its Divide software, announced Thursday it has raised $11 million in funding.\nEnterproid launched at the Demo Spring 2011 conference back in March, and even then we had a feeling these guys had a smart idea. Business users don\u2019t want to carry two phones, one for work and one for personal (believe me, I know). The Divide software makes it super simple to switch between two profiles on one phone, and it wraps the business profile in an extra layer of security.\nThe IT departments at companies can use the Enterproid Divide software too. IT pros can remotely wipe business profiles from company phones without getting rid of personal data, and they can see which phones are accessing business databases.\n\u201cEmployees bringing their own devices to work is a growing phenomenon, and Enterproid has found a solution for the challenge it creates for businesses\u2019 privacy and security,\u201d said Dave Zilberman, Principal at Comcast Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWe think Enterproid provides meaningful customer value, has the potential to disrupt an industry and, most importantly, changes the way people live, work and interact.\u201d\nEnterproid\u2019s $11 million in first-round funding was led by Comcast Ventures, with participation from Google Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures.\n}}

{{Decho Corp.\nHot on the heels of its iOS counterpart, online backup service Mozy just released an app for Android. That's a major perk for anyone already using the service to archive their data.\nMozy, of course, is the quiet desktop tool that automatically copies your critical files to the cloud. I've been a user for years, and just this week I had to take advantage of it after a sudden system failure. Worked like a charm.\nThe app, which is free, enables you to access your files on the run. You can, for example, retrieve Word and Excel documents, view photos, and even play MP3s and certain kinds of videos.\nMozy also lets you share files via e-mail, or download them directly to your phone or tablet. (To access these options, you simply tap and hold any file. Unfortunately, you can't do likewise with folders.)\nMozy for Android is virtually identical in form and function to Mozy for iPhone, so I recommend reading Lance Whitney's coverage of the latter if you want to learn more.\nI do share his opinion that navigation could be better; drilling down through a folder structure is a less-than-ideal way to find the file(s) you want. At least there's a search option. (Lance noted that it didn't work with entire data sets, only individual folders, but in my tests that wasn't the case: you can indeed search from the top level.)\nIf you're already using a service like Dropbox or SugarSync to access files on the go, I'm not sure there's much point in switching to Mozy. But if you're a Mozy user, it's a no-brainer: grab this app. (If you're not a Mozy user, I can't recommend it highly enough--especially the free 2GB MozyHome account.)\n}}

{{T-Mobile's newly unveiled Pulse handset is the carrier's third Android device, but the first on a pay-as-you-go tariff and designed to appeal to a broader market.\nI had a very brief hands-on with the Pulse at T-Mobile's London launch event, and was impressed with the smoothness of the gesture-based user interface.\nHowever, another journalist at the same event criticised the Pulse's resistive touch screen for not being quite as responsive as the capacitive design used on Apple's iPhone.\nThe 3.5in screen is certainly a decent size, and T-Mobile even suggested that this would allow the Pulse to replace an in-car satellite navigation device when used with the built-in TeleNav software.\nT-Mobile's Canvas home screen provides a desktop area larger than can fit onto the physical display, and you can move around with the flick of a finger to pan or scroll the display.\nCanvas also lets you customise this home screen by dragging in the icons you most often access from the application menu to create a shortcut, similar to the way you would on a Windows PC.\nThe handset itself is about the same size and weight as the iPhone, but unlike Apple's device has the standard green and red call \/ hangup buttons as well as a miniature trackball bracketed by menu \/ back keys for those who don't like using the touch screen for everything.\nAn on-screen keyboard pops up whenever you need to key in text, such as when composing an email, and T-Mobile offers a choice of full Qwerty or a layout similar to RIM's SureType. Its predictive text input algorithm also offers a choice of words you can tap to select.\nThe device we saw was a pre-production unit, and so there were one or two quirks. The screen did not automatically change orientation when we twisted it round as it is supposed to, for example.\nHowever, in the brief time available we found the device seemed to deliver a reasonable experience when accessing the web. We especially liked how easy it was to browse Android Market for available applications, one feature that has driven uptake of Apple's rival iPhone.\nThe Pulse certainly ticks all the right boxes at first glance; HSPA support, Wi-Fi, GPS (with a trial version of the TeleNav navigation software), touch-screen and a decent-looking user interface.\nA full review of the T-Mobile Pulse will appear on V3.co.uk, just as soon as we can get hold of one for long enough.\n}}

{{Those who have deemed the Nexus One the best Android phone yet may like it even more now that the dock is available from Google. Not only does the phone charge while sitting in the dock, but cradling it there will automatically fire up the clock application, complete with local weather. You can even use it to run a slideshow of the pics you have stored on the phone.\nBut the really cool feature is the integrated Bluetooth, which allows the docked Nexus One to stream music wirelessly to the dock. Plug in some external speakers and the set-up becomes a full-fledged entertainment system. At $45, the Nexus One Dock isn\u2019t cheap, but all those features make it worth a look.\nSpeaking of music, personal media player maker ARCHOS, which already has a 5-inch tablet based on the Android platform for sale, this week leaked details about its forthcoming 7-inch model . This new web tablet adds a web cam to the mix, and is expected to sell for just $245.\nIn the meantime, a netbook running Android has been sent to the FCC for review prior to launch.

{{If you've long forgotten about Google's Android One initiative, well, it's not your fault. The plan to offer pure Android on low-cost phones was meant for developing nations, so you may never have seen one if you live in the US or the UK.\nBut the Android One family just got a new member: Xiaomi's Mi A1. The metal-bodied phone was announced today in New Delhi, India, and will hit 40 countries, including India, Russia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico, later this month.\nPriced at 14,999 Indian Rupees, which converts to roughly $235, \u00a3180 and AU$295, the A1 is an inexpensive way to get a pure Android experience. Unfortunately, the phone is unlikely to be made officially available in the US -- though it won't be too hard to find one through an online reseller.\nAloysius Low\/CNET\nSpec wise, the A1 is a lot more powerful than most Android One phones. It packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, while most of its Android One competition run on slower Snapdragon 400-series chips. It also sports two 12-megapixel rear cameras, similar to the ones found on Xiaomi's flagship Mi 6, which offer 2x optical zoom as well as portrait mode.\nBut if you're thinking that Xiaomi came up with a completely new phone from scratch, that's not exactly the case. The A1 is actually known as the Xiaomi Redmi 5X in China, but now repackaged for the global market.\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's a sweet phone for its price. And if you've hated the fact that Xiaomi's phones run Xiaomi's custom MIUI, the good news is that the A1 is all Android with none of the distractions (except for the camera app, which is from Xiaomi).\nQuick specs\n}}

Hopefully the Google guys will quickly get round to delivering a fix for this missing December issue sometime this month, otherwise it could be seen as a bit embarrassing to say the least.\nSo we\u2019d like to hear from any of our readers that own a Nexus device and received the 4.2 Jelly Bean update to let us know if the missing month of December 2012 will be a bit of an issue for you.

{{The release of Instagram for Android has, understandably, been met with a great deal of fanfare, with 1 million downloads in under 24 hours. The release has also been accompanied by a surprisingly vile backlash from a group of iPhone users who are annoyed, to say the least, with the appearance of Android users in their previously exclusive space.\nThe comments on Twitter were filled with complaints about the app losing exclusivity, among other things:\nEW why can Android users get instagram now? #bs #teamiPhone \u2014 ali ovenshine (@heyyali) April 3, 2012\nIf instagram gets lame we ALL know who to blame #Android \u2014 Anthony Velarde (@AntTwitty) April 3, 2012\nEw.

After all, while we saw a renewed set of flamewars sizzling their way to the forefront, we never would have imagined such an angry outburst from some iPhone users.\nKeeping that in mind, ditching Instagram, if even just for a while, until they get over themselves, seems pretty par for the course, at least for those who felt the burning desire to speak out against the introduction of the Android app.\nRead next: Why we get so angry online, and how to deal with the rage\n}}

{{At a Hong Kong press event to unveil the Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone, Google finally shared details of Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), the next version of Android. ICS is meant to clean up the user interface found in Honeycomb, the current platform for Android tablets, and unify the platform for both smartphones and slates.\nBased on the presentation I saw from Google(s goog) representatives, the company appears to have done an admirable job on both counts. Here\u2019s a look at the new platform:\nA cleaner, more consistent look and feel\nThe user interface is more consistent with left and right swipes: a central action for managing information and applications. A new font, called Roboto, is easier on the eyes and looks great on the high-resolution screen of the Galaxy Nexus. And the useful, customizable widgets found on Android tablets make their way to the handset.\nMatias Duarte, Android\u2019s head of user experience (and the main designer for Palm\u2019s webOS(s hpq)), said three design principles were used for ICS because \u201cpeople like Android and people need Android, but people don\u2019t love Android.\u201d The new edition of Android was built to be \u201cenchanting, easy, and to make me awesome; it\u2019s powerful and smart,\u201d claims Duarte.\nSome of that power and smartness is seen in the new notifications, which can be accessed from the lock screen. Individual notifications can be swiped away leaving only important items. And the platform now offers facial recognition to unlock the phone; if the handset recognizes you via the front camera, it unlocks.\nText input is vastly improved with an updated keyboard that uses in-line spell checking and a new cut\/copy\/paste method. Selected text can be copied to the clipboard or dragged and inserted on-screen. Voice recognition for input is now \u201cinstant\u201d; as Duarte spoke during a demo, the handset began typing what he said without waiting for him to finish.\nCore app updates\nHugo Barra, Android\u2019s director of product, showed off core application updates, including the browser, Gmail, Calendar, Data Usage, Photos and People. The updated web browser supports up to 16 tabs. A tab can be closed by \u2014 this should sound familiar by now \u2014 swiping it off the screen. Apps are closed the same way. Offline reading mode, incognito browsing and bookmark syncing with Google Chrome on the desktop are also supported.\nGmail still doesn\u2019t have a unified Inbox, but now has two-line previews and a contextual action bar at the bottom. Offline search is available for 30 days, but the time period is user-configurable. The new Calendar looks cleaner and supports pinch-and-zoom to view event details or different time periods.\nNew to Android is a native data usage meter showing a graphical display of mobile broadband usage. That\u2019s handy in light of bandwidth caps and ICS supports the setting of alarms to help consumers manage their data use. Geeks will like the drill-down data usage by application where they can disable background data at the app level.\nThe new Photos application is revamped to make it easier and quicker to snap images. From the lock screen, the camera is accessible with one tap and the zero-shutter lag demonstration shows that ICS \u2014 on the Galaxy Nexus, at least \u2013 can take photos as fast as you can hit the button. Filters are now part of the photo app and the camera supports face detection for portraits or group shows. A new panorama mode is added as well.\nA new feature called People reminds me of the old webOS Synergy function: All social network connections for a given contact are integrated on their People card. Swiping right shows a contact\u2019s aggregated social status updates. And very social ICS users will like the new Android Beam feature that works with a near-field communications (NFC) chip. Tapping two phones together beams data from one to the other: YouTube videos, People records, photos, web pages, maps and more.\nI can\u2019t pass final judgment on this version of Android until I use it myself, but based on the demonstration I saw, it\u2019s safe to say that Ice Cream Sandwich is a large, positive step forward for Android. It removes many of the inconsistencies found in the current versions while improving and simplifying the feature set of Google\u2019s mobile platform.\n}}

{{Nintendo's next gaming machine will reportedly use an Android operating system.\nFile this under rumor for now, as the news come from an anonymous insider speaking to Nikkei, one of the leading newspapers in Japan (via Kotaku). The source \u2014 per Kotaku's translation \u2014 indicates that the move to Android is motivated by a desire to see support for a wider range of third-party games on Nintendo machines.\nIt's still not clear if the device, codenamed \"Nintendo NX,\" is a set-top box or a handheld, but Google's OS has the ability to cater to either.\nIt's not quite that simple, however. Nintendo's troubles with bringing third-party content to the Wii U have more to do with the hardware than anything else. The 32-bit PowerPC processing core at the heart of the Wii U is unlike the 64-bit ARM architecture found in the competing PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.\nIn simple terms, it's more expensive to develop cross-platform games for Nintendo's console as a result of that hardware divide. PlayStation and Xbox are both based on the present standards in personal computing, but the Wii U is not. That's why Nintendo's robust library of first-party games isn't complemented by familiar favorites like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed.\nA switch to Android isn't without its benefits for Nintendo, however. It's a much more online-connected platform than anything the company's ever released, for starters. There's already a (long overdue) unified account system coming, allowing users to carry one profile across an entire family of Nintendo devices. And an Android-powered machine could be the first step for that.\nThe OS change also means that the \"NX\" potentially has access to the existing lineup of games offered via Google Play. It's a rapidly growing list, especially as more powerful Android-powered set-top boxes enter the market. Even now, popular multiplatform games like Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and The Talos Principle are on Google Play (but not Nintendo).\nAndroid is the headline name here, but the real news lies between the lines of this rumor: a hardware shift is necessary. Google's OS depends on the same ARM architecture that PlayStation and Xbox do, so PowerPC \u2014 the real obstacle for the Wii U in this hardware generation \u2014 has to disappear.\n}}

{{With all the excitement surrounding Android 4.2.2 this week, as you look down at your non-Nexus phone or tablet you may be feeling more than a little left out. Fortunately, the CyanogenMod team has worked quickly to release nightly builds of CM 10.1 to their lineup.\nIt\u2019s not always easy to sift through an Android update, as history has taught the CyanogenMod team. Previous Android updates that seemed small on the outside have often had so much underlying code that the merge took weeks. Android 4.2.2 is all about polish, slightly changing dozens of tiny things across the operating system. Adding colons and changing font size, as well as fixing some known performance and Bluetooth bugs.\nThere are more than a few tiny changes, but now that the changes are live in the Android Open Source Project, Android developers can get to work merging the changes into their own projects. CyanogenMod, as one of the largest third party Android OS developers, will be releasing updates to their lineup of supported smartphones over the weekend.\nOn top of the Nexus devices that are already running Android 4.2.2, CM10.1 nightlies for the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Tab P1000, and Asus Trnasformer Prime Infinity are available. Throughout the weekend, more smartphones and tablets are likely to become available. The CM team briefly commented on their progress, noting that as one device in a \u201cfamily\u201d becomes available, the others will be quick to follow behind. So, if your carrier version of something like the Galaxy S3 isn\u2019t available yet, you won\u2019t be waiting for very long. All of the work being done here continues toward the monthly stable release of CM10.1, which will be announced later this month.\nCyanogenMod 10.1 remains the best way to bring your gadget to the latest version of Android, since even phones that will be announced next week will not get the update to Android 4.2.2 from the manufacturer for at least a couple of months. In the case of a phone like the Galaxy S3, whose version of Android is so heavily augmented by Samsung, it\u2019s more likely that the Galaxy S4 will be released before an update is available.\n}}

{{Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nCNET\nI had feared that the Apple vs. Android rivalry was dying.\nI had worried that there was a peculiar detente between the two parties.\nPerhaps it's got something to do with their diets. Perhaps fans of Apple's iOS mobile software have suddenly turned healthy, even in their attitudes towards people who prefer devices that run Google's Android software.\nI wonder this after reading a report from food delivery site Eat24. The company's boffins culled data from its Android and iPhone apps over the last three months and unearthed some contrasting results.\nBefore they even consider their food, 27 percent of those using the Eat24 iPhone apps click on the \"healthy\" tab. Only 17 percent of Android users do the same.\nWhat does this tell us? That Apple users are more self-conscious about their figures and entrails? That Android users mainly live in the south?\nThere's more.\nApple users ordered vegetables 7 percent more than did their counterparts in the allegedly open kingdom. Yes, 35 percent of Apple users insisted on at least some vegetables with order, according to Eat24.\nPerhaps you feel, though, that Apple users are more bland. The evidence in your favor is that Android users have a 10 percent greater penchant for ordering something spicy.\nAs you're wondering about how to specifically insult a member of the opposite smartphone persuasion, I will leave you with one final side dish of data.\niPhone users are twice as likely to order pick up, Android users prefer to sit on their couches and wait for a student to arrive on a moped. I'm sure they tip well.\nNaturally, Eat24 delved deeper into the symbolism. They noted how Google likes to name new operating systems after (unhealthy) foods. Some might even choose to note that Apple's logo keeps the doctor away while Android's little droid is a touch on the portly side.\nEat24 declared Apple users clearly more healthy.\nSo please look around you, therefore, and consider whether your iPhone-loving friends are healthier than their Android counterparts.\nThen go for a walk, sign up for a gym membership, cut down on your meal portions and tell everyone you're merely defending the honor of your smartphone brand.\n}}

{{Millions of Android phones are still vulnerable to the Stagefright bug, after Google issued a flawed security patch which failed to fix the issue.\nIn case you haven't heard of Stagefright, it's a security vulnerability located at the very heart of the Android operating system, which allows a person to take over a victim\u2019s phone by simply sending an MMS or a video message.\nThe attacker can then gain access to sensitive data, including text logs and picture messages.\nZimperium Labs\u2019 researcher Joshua Drake first uncovered the vulnerability at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas, when it was unveiled that the vulnerability affects Android devices from version 2.2 to 5.1.\nIn response Google, Samsung and LG rolled out security patches to fix the flaw and promised to bolster the security of Android with monthly fixes.\nHowever, Jordan Gruskovnjak, a security expert at Exodus, has now released a report indicating that the four-line code included in the Google patch is not enough to fix the problem.\nThe company says the patch handles 32 and 64-bit values in a different matter, which is why Android users could still be victims to such an attack.\nGruskovnjak crafted a malicious MP4 file that was able to crash an Android Nexus 5 device in the same way as Stagefright.\nExodus said that it first contacted Google over 120 days ago but did not initially get a response.\n\"There has been an inordinate amount of attention drawn to the bug. We believe we are not likely to be the only ones to have noticed it is flawed. Others may have malicious intentions,\" the report warned.\nGoogle has since announced an open source security fix for Android devices in another attempt to plug the Stagefright vulnerability.\n\"Currently over 90 percent of Android devices have a technology called ASLR enabled, which protects users from this issue,\" Google told V3.\n\"We've already sent the fix to our partners to protect users, and Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and Nexus Player will get the OTA update in the September monthly security update.\"\n}}

{{GOOGLE HAS, as expected, rushed out its first Android P preview to developers.\nDevs can download the Android P Developer Preview 1 release now, and it's officially be supported on Google's Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, and Pixel 2 XL handsets.\nIt's bad news for users of the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, though, as Google has confirmed that, since two years have passed since the handsets were released, it's phasing out major updates for these devices. Perhaps less surprisingly, Google will also stop pushing updates to its now-ageing Pixel C tablet.\nStill, unlike last year's Android Oreo release, Android P brings with it a tonne of new features, although not all will be welcome ones.\nChiefly, Android P brings with support for 'cutout' displays, no doubt to tackle the growing epidemic of iPhone X copycats such as the Asus Zenfone 5 series and upcoming LG G7 and OnePlus 6. Google says that, by adding support for notched displays in Android P, it'll make it easier for developers to manage how a screen cutout an app's content.\nAndroid P also embraces the growing trend of dual camera setups. Google's new multi-camera API allows developers to access different streams on devices that have two or more physical cameras.\nImproved messaging notifications are also on the Android P agenda, with Google giving users the option to view more information, including photos and stickers, from the notification bar (below). Smart replies, borrowed from Google Allo, are also coming to the notification menu, offering users automatically generated contextual responses.\nAs expected, Google is also settings its sights firmly on improving the performance and security of Android with its latest OS update.\nAndroid P will bring with it improvements to Android Runtime (ART), for example, which will now use profile information to rewrite DEX files resulting in an 11 percent reduction across apps, according to Google, while improvements Doze, App Standby, and Background Limits will improve device battery life.\nOn the security side of things, Google will prevent idle apps from accessing the smartphones' camera and mic, in a bid to ensure that dodgy apps running in the background, such as the SonicSpy spyware uncovered last year, can't silently record audio and take pictures for blackmail.\nElsewhere in the first Android P dev preview, there's indoor positioning using WiFi RTT that will enable developers to build apps that make use of in-building navigation, support for HDR VP9 video and HEIF image compression, optimisations to Kotlin and improvements to Google's Neural Networks API.\nIn detailing its latest major OS release, Google advised devs that, as of November 2018, all apps will need to support Android Oreo. \u00b5\n}}

{{Cory O'Brien via Twitter\nWith all of the recent leaks and hands-on experiences littering the internet lately, I think it's safe to say that the Google Android Nexus One is all but a foregone conclusion. So rather than spending more time debating whether it will ever hit the market or how it will be sold, I'd like to talk about what it could do for Android when it does arrive. Will it be a game changer? Will it take out a certain phone from Cupertino?\nBy now it should be fairly obvious that no singular handset will be an iPhone killer. Taken as a whole, however, Android will amass an army of handsets that will eclipse Apple's market share. With an estimated 50 handsets due in 2010, it will be impossible to withstand the coming barrage for long. Android will overtake Apple's handset; it's not a question of \"if,\" but rather \"when\" it happens. And I believe that the Nexus One is the exactly catalyst needed to push Android forward much faster.\nThe pre-launch iPhone aside, we've not seen a level of excitement like this for a phone that, for all practical purposes, doesn't even exist yet. There's obviously no marketing campaign for the Nexus One, yet lately it's routinely among the most popular topics on the technology blogs. Browsing through visitor comments, I get the sense that people no longer need to be convinced of how good Android is or what it offers.\nIf any company has a brand awareness to rival Apple it would be Google. And if the rumors are correct, Google has handcrafted every aspect of the Nexus One experience, down to each panel and icon. The videos and screen shots we've seen so far indicate a much more polished interface--one that may rival the experience of the iPhone.\nI don't think it's a stretch to say that the Nexus One will have mass-market appeal. Tech geeks and early adopters are already fawning over the specs. With its rumored Snapdragon 1GHz processor, 512MB ROM\/RAM, and AMOLOED screen, the Nexus One is the most advanced Android phone yet by far. Consumers in the market for a sharp smartphone will no doubt be attracted to the thin design and large touch screen. And as with Apple, there will be people who buy it just for the fact that it has \"Google\" on it.\nPriced right, the Nexus One could be the handset that T-Mobile's been waiting for. The carrier has offered Android phones for over a year now, but this could be the one that puts them on the fast track for the No. 3 spot here in the United States.\n}}

{{For those of you worried about the Stagefright flaw in Android, be reassured, a patch will be coming down the line in the next few days.\n\u201cMy guess is that this is the single largest software update the world has ever seen,\u201d said Adrian Ludwig, lead engineer for Android security at Google. \u201cHundreds of millions of devices are going to be updated in the next few days. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nAll Nexus devices are going to be patched, and Samsung, Motorola, HTC, LG, Sony, Android One, and hundreds of other manufacturers are going to push out the patches too, he said. Some handset vendors, like Silent Circle, have already patched their operating systems.\n\u201cWith the recent security issues, we have been rethinking the approach to getting security updates to our devices in a more timely manner,\u201d said Dong Jin Koh, EVP of Samsung Electronics, Mobile R&D Office.\n\u201cSince software is constantly exploited in new ways, developing a fast response process to deliver security patches to our devices is critical to keep them protected. We believe that this new process will vastly improve the security of our devices and will aim to provide the best mobile experience possible for our users.\u201d\nIn addition, Google, Samsung, and LG have made a commitment to send out monthly security patches to users that will fix any upcoming issues in the operating system.\nThese updates have been sent out to manufacturers for years, but now end users will get them too, and they will continue for at least three years after the launch of any new handset.\nThe post Google patches Android hijack bug Stagefright appeared first on IT SECURITY GURU.\n}}

{{Android and iOS could be starting to lose their stranglehold on the UK's smart phone sales, with 17 per cent of current Windows Phone users having jumped ship from Google's platform.\nMicrosoft has made big gains in the UK, adding 700,000 users to the platform within the last year, according to figures released by market research firm Kantar. During the three months to the end of January 2013, Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system managed to grab 6 per cent of overall smart phone sales, up from 2.4 per cent in the same period last year.\nNokia's Lumia 800 was the best-selling Windows Phone in the UK in that period, but Nokia was not the only mobile-maker to benefit from a Windows boost, with HTC's Windows Phone 8X hot on its tail in third place.\nThe figures reveal that nearly one in five users of the Windows Phone platform had previously owned an Android smart phone, whereas just 2 per cent had jumped ship from iPhone. There were also gains from BlackBerry and Symbian, with 6 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Microsoft's system is also incredibly popular with first-time buyers -- 47 per cent of all Windows Phone users have never owned a smart phone before.\nWhile Android may be seeping a few users, the Big G hasn't got too much to worry about, as it still holds 56.2 per cent of the UK market, with Apple managing to grab a respectable 30.6 per cent.\nThe biggest loser was predictably BlackBerry, dropping into fourth place behind Windows Phone, with just 5.8 per cent of UK smart phone sales.\nWindows Phone has now taken third place in the UK, Germany, France, US, Australia and Italy. The operating system seems to have finally made good on its potential as a third option against the plethora of Android devices and the might of the iPhone.\nIt's not impossible that 2013 could be the year Windows Phone takes over from iOS as the number two platform, especially if more disgruntled former Android users give it a try. Apple currently commands 21.5 per cent of smart phone sales globally, but Windows Phone is snapping at its heels with 14 per cent.\nDo you think Windows Phone has what it takes to topple iOS? Or is it destined to be stuck in the shadow of the older platforms? Let me know in the comments below or over on our Facebook page.\n}}

{{Google\nAn interface coming with the forthcoming Honeycomb version of Android will open up a new ability for programmers who want to tap into hardware power unlocked by low-level programming.\nThe new interface, is called Renderscript, said R. Jason Sams, an Android performance and graphics programmer at Google. He didn't say so in so many words, but the goal for the feature has to be better games on Android. It's a broader feature, though: it's used in Honeycomb's YouTube and Books apps.\n\"The target audience is the set of developers looking to maximize the performance of their applications and are comfortable working closer to the metal to achieve this,\" Sams said in a blog post yesterday. \"The target use is for performance-critical code segments where the needs exceed the abilities of the existing APIs.\"\nTo that end, Renderscript exposes two hardware-accelerated interfaces, one for rendering 3D graphics and one for for power-efficient computing operations. To use it, Renderscript relies on a variant of the C99 version of the C programming language. And the Renderscript plumbing that comes along with Honeycomb, aka Android 3.0, makes the decisions about whether to run the computing jobs on regular or graphics processors.\nThe Native Developer Kit Google offers for Android already lets programmers directly access low-level hardware features. Renderscript has an important difference, though: it's cross-platform. Instead of coming with software coded just for a specific chip, it comes with scripts that are compiled into an intermediate format that is then translated for a specific device only when it runs.\nOne example of Renderscript in action is a physics simulation of 900 particles below interacting with each other and simulated gravity from a tilting Honeycomb tablet with a dual-core processor.\nUpdated 7:43 a.m. PT to clarify that C99 is an instance of the C programming language.\n}}

{{Google still isn\u2019t talking about its rumored Android M release, an release that could wind up being the Android 6.0 update, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we haven\u2019t seen details emerge ahead of an announcement. In fact, we\u2019ve seen a number of exciting Android M release details arrive in the days before Google I\/O 2015.\nLast year, at Google I\/O 2014, Google took the stage to show developers a number of new products. One of those products ended up being a brand new Android update called Android L. The Android L that Google showed off on stage was not a finished product. Instead, it was an early preview of the software that would become Android 5.0 Lollipop.\nAt the end of last year, Google finally released Android 5.0 Lollipop to the public alongside the Nexus 9 and Nexus 6. In the months since the initial Android 5.0 roll out, Google and its manufacturing partners have rolled out tons of updates and several different versions of Android 5.0 including Android 5.0.1, Android 5.0.2, Android 5.1, and Android 5.1.1.\nGoogle is currently rolling out Android 5.1.1 to its Nexus devices bringing feature enhancements and bug fixes to owners of the Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and more. Before Google\u2019s able to complete its Android 5.1.1 roll out, there\u2019s a good chance that Nexus users and others will be treated to a brand new Android update, an update that is currently known as Android M.\nThe company hasn\u2019t confirmed anything yet though many expect to see the first Android M release details confirmed in just a few short days at Google\u2019s annual developer conference in San Francisco. Per usual, Google itself has helped to fuel those rumors and there\u2019s now growing excitement amongst the Android community.\nWe don\u2019t have the big picture just yet but we have bits and pieces. And some of those bits and pieces are extremely exciting to us and perhaps, they will be to you as well. With that in mind, we take a look at the Android M release, a release that could end up as Android 6.0.\n}}

{{My fascination with androids, and their increasingly fast development, never ends. Along with the fascination however, lies a degree of creepiness and uncertainty about what the future might hold for them, and more importantly, us.\nIt may just be because I\u2019ve watched The Terminator a few too many times, but there\u2019s no doubt that I do share an element of fear that one day these humanoids could in fact replace us \u2013 not entirely, but indeed dramatically.\nI haven\u2019t a particular fear of them harming us physically, as I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have built in software protection of some sort (won\u2019t they?)- its more the economic implications that concern me. Yep, J O B\u2019s.\nIt\u2019s also the potential for where these androids are likely to see most uptake. I hesitate to say it, but the sex industry is the first to come to mind.

Aside from the sex industry and monotonous service based tasks, it is believed that android\u2019s have the most potential in the field of space exploration. \u201cSince androids don\u2019t need to breathe and are not bothered by the cold of outer space, they are the perfect workers for building spaceships and facilities on the Moon, Mars, and in orbit around the Earth and elsewhere in space.\u201d say CR Willis of AndroidWorld\nIn 2055 it is predicted that \u201cAndroids will be doing all the cooking, cleaning and order taking in most restaurants. In construction sites, androids will be pouring the concrete, laying brick, and building the home\u2019s frame. At hospitals robots will be flying the planes, selling the tickets, moving the luggage and handle security as well as keeping the airport clean. They will be doing all the stocking in stores.

{{Nokia, the mobile phone brand that arguably created as well as led the mobile phone market for many years, once died a tragic death, first the victim of its own arrogance at being the early leader; then the victim of Apple and Google and their domination in smartphones; and then dealt the final blow by Microsoft, who acquired it but failed badly at trying to resuscitate the brand in its own form.\nNow Nokia the mobile phone brand is back \u2014 by virtue of a company called HMD, backed by Foxconn, and staffed by a huge number of alums from the old Nokia. HMD has licensed the Nokia name, and it\u2019s hoping to right those three wrongs as it unveils three new smartphones today on the eve of the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona: the Nokia 3, 5 and a new, global version of the 6 (originally announced in January for China only).\nAll three will be rolled out globally in Q2 in this year, Nokia said, alongside a retro feature phone (which you can read about here). They will be priced as \u201caffordable\u201d smartphones: \u20ac229 for the Nokia 6, billed as an \u201cimmersive\u201d entertainment device; \u20ac189 for the smaller Nokia 5; and \u20ac139 for the more pared-down Nokia 3. And you can now pre-register for them at nokia.com\/phones.\nIf Symbian and then Microsoft\u2019s Windows never did Nokia any favors in the smartphone race, then HMD is wiping the slate clean (or trying to, at least) with this lineup. The exterior is clearly branded Nokia, and other hardware like the camera mechanics have been developed by the team at HMD (with full endorsement: \u201cWe would not license the brand to just anyone,\u201d Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri said today).\nBut inside, all three are powered by by Google\u2019s Android \u2014 and not just any kind of Android but the most straight down-the-line update of Android that there is out there of the newest OS, Nougat 7.1.1 when they hit the market, along with monthly security updates, and all of the newest features, such as Google Assistant. \u201cWe really believe that pure and secure is the right way,\u201d Juha Sarvikas, the company\u2019s chief product officer, said.\nWill this be enough to bring in new users, and those who still have nostalgia for the old Nokia brand?\nHMD believes that there is reason not to meddle with Android these days. \u201cThree years ago, the dialler for example on Android would not have been a great experience, but today the best is actually the Google service\u201d Sarvikas said. \u201cAndroid has arrived at a point in time where the best user experience is to align with it.\u201d\nThe Nokia 6 will come with a 5.5\u201d full HD screen and is built out of a single block of 6000 series aluminium (in fact, in a demonstration of the device, he presented me and other journalists with a piece of metal that is similar to what they use when they build the handset). It also comes with a smart audio amplifier, dual speakers allow consumers to experience a deeper bass and unmatched clarity, and Dolby Atmos. It will come in four colours: Matte Black, Silver, Tempered Blue and Copper. A separate Arte edition will come with an additional 64GB storage and 4GB RAM, encase in a black high gloss package and will retail at \u20ac299.\nThe Nokia 5 is also made out of a block 6000 series aluminium, but at a smaller scale. Gorilla Glass display is 5.2\u201d. Inside, it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 with the Adreno 505 graphics processor. It is available in four colours Matte Black, Silver, Tempered Blue and Copper.\nNokia 3 meanwhile will also come with an aluminium frame and a Gorilla Glass screen, as well as an 8MP wide aperture cameras in front and back. It\u2019s also available in four colours: Silver White, Matte Black, Tempered Blue and Copper White.\nThere is another reason for this: it gives the company the ability to focus just on building hardware and marketing, without pushing resources into the work needed to build a new platform, and the ecosystem around it.\nBesides, as I mentioned earlier today, the game has moved very far along indeed, and the days for building completely new smartphone platforms, at least for now, may be finished, with resources going into the next level of intelligence and interactivity.\nThat still begs the question of whether a mobile phone company that is not developing these tools itself can succeed longer term. Others that tried to go pure Android and hope for the hardware best, like Motorola, weren\u2019t knockouts.\nBut Nokia is different. When you look at all the pieces of Nokia that fell by the wayside over the years, there were several attempts at building new platforms too (remember Meego? Or what about the team at Sailfish and Jolla?). Could HMD wearing Nokia\u2019s brand ever try to build its own experience again?\nInterestingly neither Juha nor Florian Seiche, the president of HMD (pictured here on the left, with Sarvikas to his right), would rule out ever building a platform itself, although for today, it\u2019s very much a Google story to test the appetite for Nokia smartphones.\n\u201cFor us right now, we\u2019re committed to Android,\u201d Seiche said. And indeed, during an event in Barcelona today, Google exec Jamie Rosenberg appeared on stage to \u201cWelcome Nokia into the Android family.\u201d As a family, it\u2019s an unlikely union if you know the history of Nokia, but perhaps that new approach is what the brand needs to see if it can succeed again.\n}}

{{GOOGLE APPEARS to be planning to rebrand its wearables operating system Android Wear as Wear OS in a future update.\nWith Android Wear usage way behind that of the Apple Watch and notably no major tech brands launching wearables at this year's MWC something needed to happen, but this wasn't necessarily what anyone expected.\nThe discovery was made by a Redditor using the 'Nearby' feature of Google Play Services. It can be used to help set up other Android devices near the phone, and it clearly shows 'Wear OS' and a new logo with echoes of the Google Assistant design.\nLittle is known beyond this but there are a lot of theories, because Reddit, with some users pointing out that the reputation of Android Wear devices doesn't really reflect where they are today (some of the early ones were bobbins), and perhaps more importantly that devices can be used with iOS devices too, and so the 'Android' part of the name may be confusing people.\nIt also looks from the new logo like there will be a keen steer toward Google Assistant as the centerpiece feature.\nAs such, this doesn't seem to mark the beginning of the end of Android or even Android Wear, but perhaps a way of separating the associations of the past - something that will be welcome news to the increasing number of fashion brands who have adopted the operating system for their wrist-wear and have no particular affiliation with Android.\nIn fact, it's probably as likely that the hipster designer watch brigade have got iPhones.\nMost likely, we'll see this take effect properly with Android P which is currently in developer beta. If that's the case, an official announcement is likely when the Google I\/O conference happens in May.\nThis could also explain in part why Huawei is happy to confirm that there is a Huawei Watch 3 ready to rock, but there are no plans to release it. They're probably waiting to tie up with this.\nMeanwhile Android 8.0 Oreo continues to trickle out to devices, though it's an incremental update. \u00b5\n}}

{{\"It's just code,\" says WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg.\nThis week, as programmers in Washington scrambled to fix the glitch-ridden healthcare.gov, the centerpiece of the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act architecture, their counterparts in Silicon Valley viewed the situation with a mixture of rolled eyes and sympathy.\nMany Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have experienced a flawed launch of a big product, accompanied by unexpected delays and over-budget implementation. It\u2019s the way things go here, and failure is often embraced as a learning experience. Still, around the coffee shops of San Francisco and the tech campuses of the South Bay this week, the topic of the government\u2019s health-care push often elicited cynical jokes \u2014 one tech worker quipped that a Stanford computer-science class could have built healthcare.gov for a thousandth of the reported $400 million\u2013plus budget \u2014 and confusion. How could a project involving a budget of that size and five years of lead time fail so badly? What was so hard about building, as some have called healthcare.gov, a Kayak for health insurance?\nMatt Mullenweg, the co-developer of WordPress (the open-source platform that five states are using to run their own health-insurance exchanges), was among the confused. Healthcare.gov, the largest chunk of which was overseen by Canadian IT firm CGI Federal, \u201cgets more money than all the revenue of most Silicon Valley start-ups combined,\u201d he said. He added that although \u201cstart-ups have failed launches all the time\u201d \u2014 citing Twitter as an example of a site that was \u201cunreliable for years\u201d \u2014 the scale of the health-care site, and its importance to the Obama administration\u2019s policy aims, should have made transparency a priority.\n\u201cIf the government is going to spend that much money on something, it should be open source,\u201d Mullenweg told me in a phone call. \u201cHow cool would it have been if the site launched, didn\u2019t work, and some passionate coders came in and said, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s a problem, and here, and here?\u2019 But the people who want to help aren\u2019t able to.\u201d\nEric Ries, the author of The Lean Startup and a member of Silicon Valley\u2019s cognoscenti, echoed Mullenweg\u2019s concerns. Speaking after an event in San Francisco\u2019s Soma district that was filled with tech types, Ries told me that the botched healthcare.gov rollout was emblematic of what he called \u201cstate-of-the-art incompetence.\u201d He explained that the old-school approach to the site\u2019s development, which relies on a management system known as the \u201cwaterfall model,\u201d and whose back-end database appears to run on Oracle software, had all but ensured it would run over-budget, late, and riddled with technical problems:\n\u201cYou could take any engineer on the street here and ask them, \u2018I have a friend who works for a private company \u2014 don\u2019t mention the government \u2014 who\u2019s thinking about a five-year, $100 million Oracle installation, and they\u2019ve hired an outsourced contractor to build it for them. It\u2019s going to be proprietary, hosted in their own data center, Oracle-based, with waterfall management. What are the odds that it\u2019s working on Day One?\u2019 And everyone here will tell you: zero percent.\u201d\nBut while Ries blames the specific structure of healthcare.gov for its failures, other programmers, perhaps sympathetic to Silicon Valley\u2019s emerging suspicion of government, see it as symptomatic of the government\u2019s ham-fisted approach to technology. The site is \u201conly the latest episode in a string of information technology debacles by the federal government,\u201d wrote Clay Johnson and Harper Reed, two programmers with political pasts (Johnson was Howard Dean\u2019s lead programmer in 2004; Reed was the brain behind Obama\u2019s 2012 digital campaign) in a Times op-ed. The pair went on:\nThis latest failure is frustrating for us to watch \u2026 We must find a fix to the federal procurement process that spares the government\u2019s technology projects from the self-inflicted wounds of signing big contracts whose terms repeatedly and spectacularly go unmet.\nThe White House has promised that a \u201ctech surge\u201d of the \u201cbest and the brightest,\u201d including from Silicon Valley, has been brought in to repair the health-care site. But nobody knows, or is telling anyone, who those people actually are. Contractors grilled at a congressional hearing this week wouldn\u2019t name names, and several tech executives questioned yesterday said they had no inside information on the makeup of the government\u2019s emergency coder team. Verizon has reportedly been tapped to help with the revamp, but the extent of its involvement isn\u2019t known. Former budget official Jeffrey Zients is overseeing the rescue, but since he\u2019s not a known coder, his role is limited to managing the project.\nMost plugged-in Valley insiders suspect, and hope, that Todd Park is involved. Park, the nation\u2019s chief technology officer since last year, is a founder of two health-care-focused start-ups \u2014 Athenahealth and Castlight Health \u2014 and is seen by many here as the only person in earshot of the White House who truly knows his stuff.\n\u201cIf Todd Park is in charge of this, they\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d Ries said. \u201cThat guy knows what he\u2019s doing; he\u2019s an entrepreneur by background. And nobody I know has been able to reach him since October 1, so we all assume he\u2019s in there fixing things.\u201d\nWhether the \u201ctech surge\u201d consists of a few more back-end developers or a full-scale revamp of healthcare.gov, no one doubts that the site will be fixed eventually, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will continue apace. (In a conference call this morning, Zients predicted that the site would \u201cwork smoothly\u201d by the end of November.) But the episode has confirmed the suspicions of many in Silicon Valley that the government\u2019s infrastructure, even on key projects, relies too heavily on outdated legacy systems and could be run more efficiently by those inside their own camp.\n\u201cI wish there was a better way to help,\u201d Mullenweg said of the health-care site\u2019s emergency overhaul. \u201cIt\u2019s just code.\u201d\n}}

REUTERS\/Jon Nazca\nMADRID (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s new socialist government promised on Friday it would restore free healthcare for undocumented migrants, a right removed by the former administration as part of cost-cutting.\nThe move is the latest migrant-friendly initiative by the government of Pedro Sanchez, who offered on Monday to take in a rescue ship that was drifting in the Mediterranean sea with 629 migrants on board. Italy and Malta had refused to let it dock.\nThe government will draw up a draft law with the proposal, it said, which must be approved by parliament. Although the Socialists have a minority of 84 seats in the 350-member assembly, most parties back the proposal and it seemed certain to be approved.\n\u201cHealthcare is a right and the protection of health is essential,\u201d government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told a news conference.\nSpain offers universal healthcare to its citizens. The former center-right government of Mariano Rajoy withdrew the right to general healthcare for undocumented migrants in 2012 as part of a program of spending cuts.\nThe government later reinstated some rights like access to emergency healthcare in 2015, but fell short of returning full coverage to an estimated 800,000 people residing in Spain without papers.\nSpain receives a tiny percentage of the total asylum claims in Europe, and of those received it accepts fewer than the EU average, according to the Spanish Commission for Refugees.\nHowever, the EU border agency expects illegal migration will rise again in 2018, potentially turning migration into a more pressing issue for Sanchez.\n}}

{{British Muslims with diabetes need more healthcare support during Ramadan\nThe first study in the UK to explore the beliefs which influence the experience and practices of British Muslims\u2019 diabetes management found tensions often exist between observing the important religious ritual in accordance with their faith and the competing need to manage their health.\nLead author Dr Neesha Patel, from The University of Manchester, said the research \u2013 published in the Journal Health Expectations \u2013 showed British Muslims with diabetes would like support and advice from their GP on fasting safely, providing their GP was trained, emphatic and understood the significance of Ramadan for Muslims with diabetes.\nThere are 3 million people in the UK with diabetes, and a further 850,000 who have undiagnosed Type 2. It is six times more common in the South Asian population and four times more common in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups than the general UK population. Recent figures suggest approximately 325,000 Muslims have diabetes in the UK.\nShort-term risks of fasting include poor diabetes control and dehydration. Longer-term risks include a reduced quality of life and increase in mortality.\nThe research, funded by the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Greater Manchester (NIHR CLAHRC GM), found many saw fasting during Ramadan as a religious duty which should be fulfilled by all Muslims in spite of living with diabetes.\nSome avoided telling their GP or practice nurse they were fasting. While those who did inform their GP reported that they were advised not to fast but went ahead anyway because they felt they could control their diabetes or that their GP did not understand the significance of fasting during Ramadan.\nThe reluctance to disclose fasting was not influenced by the ethnicity of the GP. Regardless of whether the GP was Pakistani Muslim or white British some respondents still perceived their GP to have a lack of expertise to support them effectively during fasting.\nFive type-2 diabetes patients interviewed who were on insulin did not fast and perceived it as a threat to their diabetes. But some patients reported receiving pressure from their family to fast as well as guilt and embarrassment at not fasting. Some reported eating their daytime meals in secret or when other family were not in the house.\nDr Patel said: \u201cAlthough the Islamic law states that the \u2018sick\u2019 can be exempt from fasting for one or all 30 days, the majority of Muslim respondents with diabetes do not perceive themselves as \u2018sick\u2019 and therefore choose to fast.\n\u201cWe found many British Muslims we interviewed did not bring the topic up with their GP or practice nurse or avoided their surgery altogether that month for fear of being told not to fast.\n\u201cThe reluctance to disclose fasting to GPs or practice nurses has potentially serious consequences for diabetes control and future health. Non-adherence to daily diabetes regime may result in more Muslim patients suffering the risks and complications associated with diabetes, leading to poor quality of life and increased use of NHS health services.\u201d\nProfessor Carolyn Chew-Graham, a Manchester GP and Professor of General Practice Research at Keele University who worked with Dr Patel on the study, added: \u201cOur study shows the importance of considering patient experiences, especially when forming guidelines in this area and suggests a need for better training for GPs and practice nurses and with Mosques and community leaders.\n\u201cGPs and practice nurses need to ask patients if they intend to fast, and if they need information about how to fast safely. Health care professionals may also benefit from training and skills into providing culturally sensitive care, and patients also need to feel that they can discuss fasting openly in the primary care consultation.\u201d\nJenne Patel, Diabetes UK Equality and Diversity Manager, said: \u201cPeople with diabetes do not have to fast during Ramadan, although many will choose to and we know that for many Muslims it is a difficult decision.\n\u201cIt is concerning that this research suggests that some Muslims feel uncomfortable in talking about their fasting decisions with their doctor or practice nurse and we need to send out the message that everyone with diabetes who is considering fasting throughout Ramadan should speak to their doctor, practice nurse and their Imam, who can help people come to the decision that is right for them.\u201d\nENDS\nNotes for editors\nFor further information or to request an interview with Dr Patel, please contact Alison Barbuti Media Relations Officer, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences | The University of Manchester.

During Ramadan Muslim people only eat two meals per day, once before sunrise (sehar) and once after sunset (iftar). Between August 2009 and May 2017 Ramadan falls in summer or spring so that daylight lasts between 17 to 19 hours, increasing the number of fasting hours and posing difficulties for Muslims with diabetes that need to eat and take medication regularly to maintain glycaemic control.\nThe qualitative study reports interviews with 23 diabetic Muslims in Greater Manchester.

{{What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\nWith healthcare reform on the agenda in the US and the UK, business school students are showing much more interest in an industry that until a few years ago attracted only small numbers of MBAs.\nThe increased interest comes at a time when the job market remains shaky and sectors such as finance are still recovering from the credit crisis and the recession. Healthcare, say career counsellors, is a growth industry that offers business graduates opportunities to solve complex challenges, work toward the public good and draw a substantial salary.\nPolicymakers in countries around the world are dealing with the problems of rising healthcare costs as well as an increasingly older population. President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare overhaul aims to expand health insurance to cover millions of uninsured Americans while curbing costs. And in the UK, David Cameron, the prime minister, has pledged to make fundamental changes to the National Health Service, the state-run healthcare system.\n\u201cHealthcare reform is one of the catalysts but [MBA interest] started before that,\u201d says George Telthorst, director of the Center for the Business of Life Sciences at Indiana\u2019s Kelley School of Business. \u201cHealthcare is a social good and I think a lot of young MBAs realise they can do good but also have a more stable career in the future.\u201d\nPharmaceuticals, healthcare consultancies and insurers have augmented their full-time recruiting activities on campuses. A recent survey by the MBA Career Services Council says schools saw an increase of nearly 40 per cent in hiring by pharmaceutical, biotech and healthcare companies.\nThe numbers are still relatively small but career counsellors expect strong growth. At Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, for instance, 33 MBAs out of a class of 426 took jobs in the healthcare industry last year, compared with a handful five years ago. At Kelley, 17 MBAs took jobs in healthcare last year, compared with 2008 when six MBAs secured jobs in the sector.\nAs healthcare companies \u201cdetermine they need to take a more business-orientated approach to their own growth\u201d, the numbers are sure to climb, says Peter Giulioni, executive director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business MBA career resource centre. The growth is also coming from students, he says. \u201cIs it simply MBAs saying: \u2018I need a job so I\u2019ll take healthcare?\u2019 I don\u2019t think so. They understand that over the next 25 years healthcare is going to be a boom industry,\u201d he says.\nMost jobs for MBAs in healthcare are in the functional areas of companies, such as marketing, operations, technology, strategy and finance. But lately, newly minted MBAs are entering the industry in novel ways, according to J.J. Cutler, deputy vice-dean of MBA admissions, financial aid and career management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe are seeing more people who are going into healthcare investing, healthcare private equity, healthcare venture capital or who want to start a healthcare business or go work for a hospital or work on the policy side.\u201d\nThis crop of MBAs\u2019 desire to pursue socially-minded careers is another reason for the surge in interest in healthcare, he says.\n\u201cThis generation is different. It has a much greater social change agenda than past generations.\u201d\nRob Brown, chief marketing officer at Eli Lilly, one of the biggest pharmaceuticals groups in the world, says MBA recruiting at the company has remained steady. \u201cHealthcare is a space where students like the idea. It\u2019s a mix of the business side, with a real desire to help.\u201d\nBusiness schools with specialised healthcare programmes have recently seen a marked rise in applicants.\nThe reason, says Kevin Schulman, professor of medicine and business administration at Fuqua, is that changes within the field of medicine and healthcare now require workers to have general management skills.\n\u201cThe things you needed to be successful in healthcare in the past were strong operational skills.\n\u201cBut the things you need to be successful going forward are analytic skills, an understanding of strategy and a great grasp of technology and all its applications.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just be an excellent clinician and assume you\u2019ll have a leadership role,\u201d he says.\n}}

{{Exclusive : Former UN secretary general accuses \u2018powerful\u2019 health interests in the US of blocking universal healthcare\nThe former United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon has denounced the United States\u2019 healthcare system as politically and morally wrong, and urged American leaders to enact publicly financed healthcare as a \u201chuman right\u201d.\nBan made the comments in an exclusive interview with the Guardian in New York, as part of his work with The Elders, a group founded by Nelson Mandela to work on issues of global importance, including universal health coverage.\nSign up for the US morning briefing\nThe US has the world\u2019s most expensive health system, accounting for nearly one-fifth of American gross domestic product and costing more than $10,348 per American. The United Kingdom, by comparison, spends a little under 10% of GDP according to the latest available statistics, and healthcare is free at the point of delivery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to understand why such a country like the United States, the most resourceful and richest country in the world, does not introduce universal health coverage,\u201d said Ban. \u201cNobody would understand why almost 30 million people are not covered by insurance.\u201d\nFailing to provide health coverage, he said, was \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cpolitically wrong, morally wrong\u201d. He accused the \u201cpowerful\u201d interests of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctors that \u201cinhibit the American government\u201d of having prevented the US from moving towards universal healthcare.\n\u201cThis is for the people. Leaders are elected because they vowed that they would work for the people,\u201d said Ban. \u201cThey are abandoning people because they are poor, then these poor people cannot find a proper medical support.\u201d\nMost Americans want universal healthcare. What are we waiting for? | Bernie Sanders Read more\nDespite astronomical spending on health, millions in the US live entirely outside the health system, uninsured and unable to go to the doctor without incurring hundreds or thousands in debt. Since President Trump was elected, an additional 4 million people have lost health coverage, according to a recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\u201cIt seems with Trump just undoing Obamacare, people were not happy first of all,\u201d said Ban, about health reforms enacted to weaken elements of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. \u201cIronically, it might have motivated people to think other ways, and influence their senators and their congressmen to think the other way.\u201d\nBan revealed he had his own run-ins with the American healthcare system. While he was secretary general between January 2007 and December 2016, the UN provided him with American health insurance. About three years ago, he set out to pick up a prescription at a pharmacy, but forgot his insurance card. A worker at the pharmacy told him that without insurance, his prescription would cost $200. If he came back with his insurance card, it would be $20.\n\u201cIt was totally unfair,\u201d said Ban. \u201cPeople like myself can afford [this]. But poor people cannot afford it. They do not have any support.\u201d\n\u201cWhile swearing in as secretary general, I pledged I would make this world better for all,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody would imagine that there should be so many people \u2013 30 million people \u2013 who would be left behind\u201d in the US.\nHealth coverage has become a major issue ahead of the congressional midterm elections in November, which are widely seen as a referendum on Trump\u2019s America.\nProgressive Democrats have called for Congress to enact \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d, a proposal to expand the public health program which covers all Americans older than 65. Establishment Democrats have argued for expansions of Obamacare.\nAs well, four conservative states are attempting to expand Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, through a ballot referendum.\nTrump and Republicans have worked to make health coverage more exclusive. The Trump administration has allowed states to add work requirements to public health programs for the poor and disabled, and Republicans ended a requirement for Americans to buy private health insurance when they cut taxes.\nUniversal healthcare was unthinkable in America, but not any more | Adam Gaffney Read more\nBan blamed the \u201csectoral interests\u201d of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctors, \u201cwhich inhibit the American government\u201d for hindering moves towards a universal health coverage plan.\n\u201cHere, the political interest groups are so, so powerful,\u201d Ban said. \u201cEven president, Congress, senators and representatives of the House, they cannot do much so they are easily influenced by these special interest groups.\u201d\nBan said he hopes states, including California and New York, will pass universal health coverage and spark a national call for public financing of health.\n\u201cIt will be either California or New York who will introduce this system,\u201d said Ban. \u201cThen I think there will be many more states who will try to follow suit.

{{See how this healthcare company retained the imprint of its founder\u2019s experience and moral compass.\nAccessOne is one of those rare companies that, despite its growth, has successfully retained the imprint of its founder\u2019s intellect, experience, and moral compass. A third-generation physician, Dr. Russell Salton has a deep-seated regard for patient dignity and well-being, but he also combines the conservative, do-no-harm philosophy of the physician with the adventurousness of the entrepreneur.\nAs a result, Dr. Salton was not only sensitive to how patients feel when unable to pay for their care, but also ready to do something about it. With AccessOne, he and his team created a system of flexible payment offerings that enable patients to fulfill their obligations while helping hospitals cover the costs of the services they provide.\nAn Opportunity He Was Born to Seize\nAs Mark Spinner, AccessOne\u2019s current President and CEO points out, entrepreneurship is in Dr. Salton\u2019s DNA. In the 1920s, his grandfather built a hospital in Williamson, a mining center in West Virginia\u2019s coal country. After establishing his reputation as a physician and surgeon, he approached local mine operators with a proposal to care for its employees for a set annual fee. \u201cIn effect, Dr. Salton\u2019s grandfather created a provider-sponsored health plan long before anyone had a name for it,\u201d Spinner notes. With this extensive patient list in hand, he was able to successfully secure financing to support the construction of a community hospital.\nDr. Salton is not just an entrepreneur, however. He is an entrepreneur who has immersed himself in the healthcare industry. \u201cIf you look at Dr. Salton\u2019s life, you could say that everything he did prepared him to found AccessOne,\u201d Spinner says.\nAfter graduating from medical school at West Virginia University, he cofounded the Charlotte-based Metrolina Family Physicians, which became the largest independent family practice group in the Southeast with 42,000 patients. He then left private practice in 1990 to cofound Primary PhysicianCare, a managed-care company, and finally, he served as Carolinas Market Medical Director for Aetna US Healthcare.\nIn other words, by the time he purchased the medical credit card company in 2002 that would become AccessOne, he had an unparalleled grasp of the dynamics that shape the healthcare system. \u201cHis level of understanding and systems intelligence about how providers, payers, and patients interact is simply off the charts,\u201d Spinner says. \u201cHe is the smartest guy I have ever met in this context.\u201d\nAt a Pivotal Moment in Healthcare\nWith Dr. Salton\u2019s comprehensive grasp of healthcare dynamics, it is not surprising that the emerging popularity of high-deductible health plans caught his attention or that he had the foresight to anticipate its implications. When Medicare, Medicaid or insurance plans accounted for 95 percent of a provider\u2019s revenue, the impact of patient defaults on its bottom line was manageable. But when patients started to account for a larger percentage of revenue, high levels of default were no longer sustainable.\nDr. Salton also perceived that the typical provider response to late payments \u2014 what Spinner terms \u201cthree calls and a collection agency\u201d \u2014 was not only costly, but also ineffective. \u201cDr. Salton saw that pressure tactics did not materially improve payment rates,\u201d Spinner says. \u201cEven worse from his perspective, they were damaging to both providers and patients.\u201d\nThe experience of being pressured to pay medical bills created animosity at the precise moment that providers, faced with consolidation and increased competition, began focusing on raising patient satisfaction. At the same time, Dr. Salton felt strongly that the consequences of sending patient accounts to collections violated the physician\u2019s creed of doing no harm. In addition to impairing a patient\u2019s credit, they discouraged patients from pursuing treatment they really needed until they were very sick, which in turn increased healthcare costs generally.\nFor Dr. Salton, there was something deeply wrong about this approach. \u201cDr. Salton\u2019s mission was to build a patient-friendly credit model for hospital systems that would ensure that every single patient they treat could be covered with affordable financing,\u201d Spinner says. \u201cIt would allow patients to pursue the care they need when they need it without fear of cost.\u201d\nRethinking the Relationship Between Patients and Providers\nDr. Salton, along with co-founder Stephen Bernard, a technologist who had experience building software systems in the insurance and wealth management industry, set out to design a system that would offer affordable, patient-friendly payment programs to all individuals and their families, regardless of credit history or account size, with no credit report, fear of collections or hidden fees \u2014 and increase the amount of reimbursement hospitals receive for services provided. \u201cDr. Salton and his team realized that healthcare is not a typical consumer market and that an approach that preserves the dignity of the patient would increase the likelihood of payment,\u201d Spinner says. \u201cTammy Geis, our Chief Operating Officer was a healthcare finance executive with Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte and brought another point of view from the provider operations and finance perspective that was key to our success.\u201d\nUnder Dr. Salton\u2019s leadership, AccessOne developed a variety of payment options, including long-term plans with no interest, lower monthly payment options with a low interest rate, and plans designed for patients receiving financial assistance or who have extremely high deductibles or catastrophic balances. They have also incorporated technology that makes it easier for patients to make payments, either from a desktop or mobile device.\n\u201cBuilding on the original program design, we have developed software to drive a user experience (via patient portals, health information system integration and mobile applications) that offers all the convenience consumers have come to expect from top-tier e-commerce or mobile banking applications,\u201d Spinner says. AccessOne supports these technologies with patient advocate contact center services, payments processing, and implementation and training services for providers.\nThe Pursuit of Incremental Improvements\nThe benefits for providers have been both substantial and measurable. Typical AccessOne clients have seen their reimbursement rates rise from below 50 percent to 80 to 90 percent. One reason for AccessOne\u2019s success was the team\u2019s willingness to constantly refine and improve the model. \u201cEvery time we have a big step up in our product platform, it has come after we deeply engaged with our health system clients in a joint effort to solve a patient ayments problem,\u201d Spinner says.\nAs an instance, he cites the case of a large healthcare system that was surprised to find that its financial assistance program for the working poor did not improve reimbursements. In fact, it was only collected 2 or 3 percent of balances after its financial assistance discount. Dr. Salton designed a program called AccessOne Outreach, a long-term, zero-interest program that pairs with a hospital\u2019s financial assistance program. AccessOne Outreach has pushed reimbursement from this class of patients to over 40 percent.\nBuilding a National Footprint\nIn 2016, Dr. Salton stepped away from day-to-day operations, retaining his post as Chairman of the Board, and Spinner, with a background in healthcare, finance, and technology, joined the company as President and CEO. \u201cThe main factor in my decision to come aboard was that I felt good about the product and services AccessOne offers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a clear-cut choice.\u201d\nSpinner\u2019s mission is straightforward. \u201cMy charge is to take a management-owned regional business with an excellent product and story and transform it into an institutionally backed national leader in our category,\u201d he says. Given its ambitions, it was particularly important for AccessOne to work with a lender capable of keeping pace with the company\u2019s growth. In May 2018, Capital One tripled the size of its senior credit facility from $50 million to $150 million. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run out of capital,\u201d Spinner declares. \u201cWe have a significant runway in front of us, and we are not going to take financing risks with a counterparty that can\u2019t keep up.\u201d\nA Culture of Innovation\nAn equally important challenge is preserving the patient-centric, do-no-harm, entrepreneurial culture that has been the foundation of AccessOne\u2019s success. As a reminder of these values, Spinner recently posted the blueprints for the Salton\u2019s Williamson hospital in the company\u2019s new headquarters. And he is making sure that his management team exemplifies the values that AccessOne stands for. \u201cWe are recruiting people, acquiring companies and doing a lot of things that are changing the dynamics of our workplace,\u201d Spinner says. \u201cWhile we are doing this, we are simultaneously making a special effort to ensure that our employees leave work each day proud of what they are doing.\u201d\nFor as Spinner notes, focusing on the patient is the key to all the benefits that AccessOne provides. \u201cAs long as we can deliver new products, services, formats and technology to support patients, our healthcare system clients are going to prosper,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are going to attract more patients, drive higher patient satisfaction, and significantly lower bad debt expense.\u201d\n}}

{{England\u2019s care regulator has warned that one of the country\u2019s largest home care providers, private equity-owned Allied Healthcare, could stop operating at the end of the month.\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) has written to 84 local authorities telling them as many as 9,300 elderly and vulnerable people are at risk of losing their home care services after 30 November. The CQC has written to the local authorities across England telling them there is a \u201ccredible risk\u201d that Allied may have to cease services when a loan payment becomes due at the end of the month.\nAllied, the largest provider of domiciliary care in the UK, is owned by German private equity investor Aurelius. About 13,000 people receive care from Allied across the UK, including Wales and Scotland. Allied is also a major provider to the National Health Service.\nAndrea Sutcliffe, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, said the regulator has \u201cnot received adequate assurance that the company has, or will have, the ongoing funding or new investment necessary to ensure the business can operate beyond [30 November].\n\u201cWe have encouraged Allied Healthcare to provide us with a realistic financially backed plan to support the future sustainability of the business, and given them every opportunity to do so, but they have failed to provide adequate assurance regarding future funding.\u201d\nHowever, in a statement Allied insisted its care provision is \u201csustainable and safe\u201d. It is understood that the lender behind the working capital facility due to be repaid on 30 November intends to extend the loan until the new year, while the company is also in discussions with alternative lenders.\nThe Allied statement said the firm is \u201csurprised and deeply disappointed\u201d by CQC\u2019s move, describing it as \u201cpremature and unwarranted\u201d. The CQC \u201cdisregarded\u201d its assurances, Allied said.\nThe CQC is obliged to notify local authorities if it thinks a firm carrying out regulated care services is likely to collapse, to allow councils time to prepare contingency plans.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nSimon Bottery, a senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund, a health thinktank, said: \u201cThe problems faced by Allied Healthcare are a symptom of the huge pressures facing a social care system which is at breaking point after years of underfunding.\u201d\nHe added that the problems are \u201cyet another wakeup call to the huge problems in social care\u201d for the government ahead of an expected green paper outlining reforms to the sector.\nAllied has endured a difficult period in recent years, alongside other struggling care providers. In May it agreed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with unsecured creditors, including landlords, suppliers and a closed pension scheme, allowing it to delay payment on some of its debts.\n}}

{{For millions of netizens, the internet is the first point of reference for any health problem. But a critical issue is how to chaff out the amateur advice which may, at most times, work as a placebo, but in the worst case scenario, can aggravate a health problem. However, doctor-turned-entrepreneurs Debraj Shome and Arbinder Singal started their online venture MediAngels in January this year and positioned it as an e-hospital to provide information and services for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions.\nThe venture also seeks to reduce the health information asymmetry by providing consumers with accurate information, so that they are able to make the right health decisions.\n\u201cIt is funny that consumers can have the best pizza and buy the best laptop in India today, but most people do not have the means or the patience to evaluate medical care they are receiving in an objective manner and also have no means to consult the best doctors in the world. That is where MediAngels brought in a radical change,\u201d says Shome.See our video report.\nMediAngels has a panel of 300 doctors from 85 specialties and sub-specialties, has tie-ups with more than 21,000 laboratories across the country in India and provides online storage space for medical documents and reports, plus a live chat feature for one-to-one communication with doctors. A consultation with an Indian doctor can cost a patient as little as Rs 250 (compared to an average of around Rs 500 that a general practitioner charges in a reputed private hospital or clinic in Tier I cities in India) and a session with a global practitioner may cost around $100 (Rs 4,484).\nThe Company works on a 60:40 revenue-share model where the doctors on the panel receive majority of the money while MediAngels gets the rest.\nThe company\u2019s monthly burn rate is around Rs 40-Rs 50 lakh, and it currently has three offices in Mumbai \u2013 one for the technology team, another for the sales & distribution team and the third one for the digital sales and marketing team. One of the offices also doubles up as MediAngels operation centre.\nThe Beginnings\nMediAngels traces its roots to a personal tragedy for one of the co-founders. In 2009, Shome\u2019s father was diagnosed with lung cancer which had already spread to four organs and doctors said he had, essentially, just around six months to live.\nBut Shome was able to gain access to Dr Katherine Pisters, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and she advised him to try a new medicine for lung cancer \u2013 a medicine which was not used in India at that point of time. \u201cWe tried that drug and in six months, my dad was cancer-free,\u201d recalls Shome.\nIt has been three years now and although his father had three relapses since, the Shome family has been able to find a new medicine each time that has prevented the disease from spreading.\n\u201cBeing a doctor, I had access to all these specialists and was able to treat my dad in a way no one else would have been able to. That\u2019s why we decided to set up a consulting platform which would allow end-consumers to go and seek opinion for their particular diseases from the best doctors around the globe,\u201d says Shome.\nMoneybags & Scaling Up\nInitially, Shome and Singal invested a few crore from their own pockets to establish MediAngels but has also attracted investment of Rs 3 crore from HDFC Holdings Ltd, a wholly owned investment arm of India\u2019s largest mortgage lender HDFC. As of end May, MediAngels already had 1,500 customers, 40 per cent of whom were from outside India, from countries like Australia, the USA, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, Africa and the Middle East.\nOut of the 60 per cent customers from India, half were from metros like Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata while surprisingly, the other half were from small towns (in a country where the internet penetration is very low) like Jhumri Talaiya, Kohima and remote parts of Assam. MediAngels has far exceeded the revenue projections made by its founders and this has also pushed up its company valuation within three months of its launch.\nMediAngels is now looking at opening new offices across the country. The company will also hire at least 100 people by the end of the year for operations, marketing, sales and distributions.\nShome thinks that the company will require at least $20 million (around Rs 90 crore) more to become a globally placed e-hospital and he intends to raise more funds for the same.\n}}

Other doctors and nurses are now terrified they may have caught this killer disease and could have already passed it on to their partner or children.\u201d\nMONKEYPOX: Signs of the deadly disease MONKEYPOX is a virus that can prove fatal - especially if young and old fall sick.\nIt's similar to smallpox, the highly-contagious and deadly disease that was eradicated in the 80s. But monkeypox is still wide spread in villages of Central and West Africa. It's more prevalent in areas close to tropical rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected animals. The disease doesn't pass easily from person-to-person, making a human outbreak unlikely. Symptoms: The symptoms of monkeypox last for about 14 to 21 days, they include: fever\nintense headache\nswollen lymph nodes\nback pain\nmuscle aches\nintense lack of energy\nlesions on the face that spread to the rest of the body The lesions eventually turn into pus-filled blisters before they scab over. Treatment: There are no specific treatments or vaccines for monkeypox, but outbreaks can be controlled. Vaccination against smallpox has been proven to be 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox in the past. But the vaccine is no longer available to the general public after smallpox was eradicated. Source: World Health Organisation\nThe healthcare worker\u2019s diagnosis is said to have sparked panic among other staff on the Blackpool isolation unit where an infected patient was admitted three weeks ago.\nMost monkeypox patients recover within a few weeks, but it can be deadly \u2014 particularly in vulnerable patients like the young and elderly.\nPHE said the worker\u2019s case was detected by increased surveillance of staff. But a source said she was diagnosed by her GP when she fell ill.\nPHE\u2019s Dr Nick Phin said: \u201cThis worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made.\n\u201cWe have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so they can be assessed quickly.\n\u201cIt is therefore not wholly unexpec\u00adted that a case has been identified.\u201d\nThe first monkeypox patient was taken to London\u2019s Royal Free Hospital after being diagnosed in Cornwall this month.

It is only at this point that they become infectious.\nThey remain a risk until the rash has scabbed over and fallen off around 14 to 21 days later.\n}}

{{On Monday we kicked off the start of the 2014 JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, which is arguably the most important health care conference of the year, bringing together pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device makers all under one roof.\nJust like the recently concluded Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, this annual event gives health care companies a chance to demonstrate to investors and Wall Street where they've been and where they're headed. Because earnings guidance can be somewhat irrelevant for clinical-stage biotech and medical device companies, consider this event your chance to gain guidance from some 300 top health care companies.\nToday, we're going to take a closer look at Arena Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:ARNA) presentation, which was given by CEO Jack Lief.\nArena Pharmaceuticals' past year\nGenerally speaking, 2013 was a transformative, but frustrating, year for Arena shareholders. The Food and Drug Administration in 2012 approved its weight control management treatment Belviq, but it took significantly longer than expected for the product to get scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration. As a result, the treatment only hit pharmacy shelves this past June.\nSimilar to VIVUS' (NASDAQ:VVUS) Qsymia, Belviq sales have been less than stellar in the early going. Putting aside milestone and collaborative revenue, Belviq delivered just $5.4 million in total product sales in the U.S. in the third quarter, of which Arena is entitled to 31.5%, or $1.7 million, with the remaining going to licensing partner Eisai (NASDAQOTH:ESALY). Initial problems that have plagued sales for both Belviq and Qsymia include poor physician awareness and limited insurance coverage.\nWhat Arena Pharmaceuticals had to say\nWhile many pharmaceutical heavy-hitters gloss over numerous ideas during their presentations, Lief hammered home three points in his JPMorgan Healthcare Conference address: maximizing the value of Belviq, pursuing additional indications for lorcaserin (that's the scientific name for Belviq), and advancing its other pipeline drugs beyond weight management.\nClearly, Arena's biggest and most immediate opportunity lies with Belviq. Lief noted that Belviq is awaiting regulatory approval in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and South Korea, and that the company anticipates filing for approval in Brazil and Taiwan shortly. Perhaps most intriguing with regard to the strategy from Arena and marketing partner Eisai is the announcement Monday that Eisai had doubled its sales staff to 400 people in an effort to improve physician awareness of the product. If you recall, VIVUS' Qsymia offered greater weight reduction in trials, but Belviq had the more favorable safety profile, making it a strong choice to be prescribed by physicians.\nPrescriptions have generally trended higher with Belviq, as you can see below, but the uptrend has been somewhat hard to predict and appears to be wholly dependent on consumers' insurance coverage.\nLief also highlighted four possible additional lorcaserin indications made possible by Arena's partnership expansion with Eisai in November, which resulted in a $60 million upfront cash payment. The indications Arena intends to explore are: lorcaserin as a treatment for smoking cessation; lorcaserin co-administered with phentermine for weight control management; an extended-release formulation of lorcaserin; and the initiation of a lorcaserin cardiovascular outcomes trial known as Camellia.\nWhile pre-clinical evidence of higher doses of lorcaserin leading to reduced nicotine addiction is encouraging, and I'd have to say an extended-release formula would certainly improve patient convenience, the roughly five-year Camellia trial -- an FDA post-marketing requirement -- is what investors really care about. A primary concern about weight-control drugs has been their long-term effect on cardiovascular function. Beginning this month, Arena plans to enroll about 12,000 patients in this study.\nFinally, Lief focused on what everyone else usually forgets -- that Arena has a completely separate pipeline of experimental drugs outside of lorcaserin\/Belviq. Lief covered four compounds: APD811 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, temanogrel for thrombotic diseases, APD334 for autoimmune diseases, and APD371 as a pain management drug.\nWe didn't hear a lot of new data here necessarily, but now have a better timeline as to when these pipeline products are expected to advance, with an APD811 trial for PAH due to start in the first half of 2014, a phase 2a trial for temaogrel expected in the second half of 2014, multiple-ascending dose trials expected for APD334 throughout 2014, and a phase 1 of APD371 already under way.\nMaking sense of it all\nWith groundbreaking new drugs sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. In the case of Arena, investors certainly get a hearty dosing of both.\nOn the positive side, I was glad to see that Eisai remains committed to helping advance Belviq in the U.S., and that there's a good chance Belviq will be approved in multiple additional nations before the year is up. Arena's lorcaserin and non-lorcaserin pipelines also show promise, but none of these studies have reached a point where I'm sold on their effectiveness as of yet.\nThen again, I'm a bit disturbed that the best Arena and Eisai can come up with to boost Belviq sales is \"throw more sales representatives at doctors and that'll do the trick!\" This just feels like the wrong approach, when Arena and Eisai should be beating down insurers' doors to get them to cover this potentially breakthrough therapy. Consumers have proven they won't pay for Qsymia or Belviq using out-of-pocket money, so sales really can't be expected to take off until more insurers latch onto the treatment.\nAnother primary concern for Arena investors has to be the length of the Camellia study. Shareholders knew from the start that this gigantic study wasn't going to be completed overnight, but five years is more than enough time for a company like Orexigen Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OREX), which is developing Contrave in partnership with Takeda Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQOTH:TKPYY), to leave Qsymia and Belviq in the dust. Orexigen has already completed a cardiovascular safety trial involving some 9,800 patients known, with the results demonstrating no increase in adverse events. This could be the difference that clears the way for Contrave to be approved in Europe, a stomping ground that Qsymia and Belviq have found elusive, and it could be a reason for Contrave to be approved in favor of either Qsymia or Belviq in the U.S.\nThis will definitely be an important year for the development of Belviq, and I believe by the late second half of 2014 we'll have a good idea of whether it was just slow out of the gate or one of the biggest busts of all time.\n}}

{{Private equity firm Sabre Capital Worldwide has got commitments of Rs 250 crore to invest in India's healthcare space. Sabre Capital has set up a company called Spring Healthcare Ltd through which it plans to make these investments. Spring Healthcare will act as both an investment and operating company and is not structured as a private equity fund. The funds for investments have been raised from large family offices of Asia and a few healthcare focused institutions from the US, said Rajiv Maliwal, co-founder and managing partner of Sabre Capital, in an interview to VCCircle. Maliwal is also the chairman of Spring Healthcare.\nThe investment corpus can be increased when there are more attractive opportunities. \"If we have the right opportunities we will have Rs 1,000 crore,\" Maliwal said.\nSpring Healthcare is looking to invest in mid-sized, specialised hospitals which have 100-200 beds. It's also looking at path labs, dialysis labs, in vitro fertilization (IVF) labs and also CROs (Contract Research Organizations). \"We will also do maybe one or two greenfield hospitals,\" says Maliwal. Spring Healthcare is not looking at companies in drug discovery or pharmaceuticals space.\nA large number of private equity firms are looking at investing in the healthcare space in India. But Maliwal believes that the opportunity is too large. The developing markets of China, Brazil and Korea have 3-4 beds per 1,000 persons. India has less than 1 bed per 1,000 persons. \"We need to add 20 lakh beds just to catch up,\" he adds.\nSpring Healthcare has already invested Rs 65 crore in Pune-based Oyster and Pearl Hospital, which specialises in child, woman care and in vitro fertilisation. Oyster is now planning to open three more hospitals in the region of Western Maharashtra. The investee companies will typically expand in their own regions, said Maliwal.\nSpring Healthcare is looking to invest in cities beyond the top 6-8 metros in the country. The hospitals, being specialised, will be somewhat high end. Spring Healthcare is also building functional capabilities in areas like hospital management services, information technology, finance & administration which they will bring to the hospitals they invest in.\nFrom Finance to Healthcare\nSabre Capital now seems to be moving away from banking & finance, where it has been its area of speciality. \"At the moment for the next few years our principal focus is on healthcare,\" said Maliwal.\nSabre acquired management control of the then ailing Centurion Bank in 2003 with other investors and was responsible for turning it around. Centurion Bank was later merged with Bank of Punjab and then sold to HDFC. Sabre Capital got a 103% IRR on its investment, said Maliwal. It also set up Lotus India Asset Management with Singapore state investor Temasek, an investment which did not turn out well and was sold to Religare Enterprises last year.\nIt also floated private equity fund called Sabre-Abraaj Capital with Dubai-based Abraaj Capital which was planning to raise $250-300 million. The fund has managed to raise only $100 million, and has invested all the capital. The investments from this fund are in infrastructure space which include Ramky Infrastructure, ECI Engineering Construction, and Man Infraconstruction.\nMaliwal believes that distress opportunities in India are not yet available. \"I think distress opportunity is still not there because the Indian industry has done pretty well,\" he said. Businesses in India are slowing down but they do not have a big problem like they have in US, adds Maliwal.\n}}

{{U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) wrote to various health care stakeholders to seek input on ways to best improve cybersecurity in the healthcare industry.\nIn the letters, Sen. Warner, a member of the Senate Finance Committee and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, pointed to the increasing toll of innovation on information security, expressed concern about the impact of cyber-attacks on the health care sector, and conveyed his desire to work alongside health care entities to develop strategies that strengthen information security.\n\u201cThe increased use of technology in health care certainly has the potential to improve the quality of patient care, expand access to care (including by extending the range of services through telehealth), and reduce wasteful spending. However, the increased use of technology has also left the health care industry more vulnerable to attack,\u201d said Sen. Warner. \u201cAs we welcome the benefits of health care technology we must also ensure we are effectively protecting patient information and the essential operations of our health care entities.\u201d\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, more than 113 million care records were stolen in 2015. A separate study conducted that same year estimated that the cost of cyberattacks would cost our health care system $305 million over a five-year period. Furthermore, a 2017 report by Trend Micro found that over 100,000 healthcare devices and systems were exposed directly to the public internet, including electronic health record systems, medical devices, and network equipment.\n\u201cI would like to work with you and other industry stakeholders to develop a short and long term strategy for reducing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the health care sector,\u201d Sen. Warner concluded. \u201cIt is my hope that with thoughtful and carefully considered feedback we can develop a national strategy that improves the safety, resilience, and security of our health care industry.\u201d\nThe sensitive nature of medical information makes the health care industry a lucrative target for criminals seeking to profit from personally identifiable information. Medical records often contain private information, including a patient\u2019s social security number, address, and health history. When stolen, this information can be used to conduct identity theft or ransomware attacks.\nIn order to start a dialogue and gather facts about cybersecurity vulnerabilities, Sen. Warner also asked the following questions:\nWhat proactive steps has your organization taken to identify and reduce its cyber security vulnerabilities? Does your organization have an up-to-date inventory of all connected systems in your facilities? Does your organization have real-time information on that patch status of all connected systems in your facilities? How many of your systems rely on beyond end-of-life software and operating systems? Are there specific steps your organization has taken to reduce its cybersecurity vulnerabilities that you recommend be implemented industry wide? One of the imperatives from the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force Report is for the sector to \u201cdevelop the heath care workforce capacity necessary to prioritize and ensure cybersecurity awareness and technical capabilities.\u201d To that end, what workforce and personnel challenges does your organization face in terms of security awareness and technical capacity? What steps have you taken to develop the security awareness of your workforce and\/or add or grow technical expertise within your organization? Has the federal government established an effective national strategy to reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the health care sector? If not, what are your recommendations for improvement? Are there specific federal laws and\/or regulations that you would recommend Congress consider changing in order to improve efforts to combat cyberattacks on health care entities? Are there additional recommendations you would make in establishing an industry wide strategy to improve cybersecurity in the health care sector?\nLetters were sent to some of the nation\u2019s largest health stakeholders: the American Hospital Association, AdvaMed, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, American Medical Association, Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, Virginia Association of Health Plans,National Rural Health Association, Federation of American Hospitals, Healthcare Leadership Council, Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and Med ISAO.\nLike this: Like Loading...\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n}}

{{After flirting with the idea for years, Amazon may finally be ready to really go after the pharmaceutical market.\nAnonymous sources reportedly told CNBC tech reporter Christine Farr that Amazon is hiring a manager to lead a team focused on pharmaceutical sales and create a strategy to break into the space. Amazon is also recruiting additional employees to focus on pharmaceuticals. The team would be part of the consumable business department at Amazon, according to the report.\nAmazon lists job openings for several healthcare-focused business development managers, solutions architects, and researchers. As Farr notes, Amazon recently started selling medical supplies in the U.S. and has expanded its Prime Now delivery service to includes drugs in Japan.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is certainly lucrative but regulatory barriers can make it tricky. That may be why Amazon has only been marginally involved in drug retail so far.\nAmazon did come close to becoming a major player in online pharmaceutical sales in 2011 when Bellevue-based Drugstore.com was looking for a buyer. Amazon maintained an ownership stake in the company from a legacy investment made in 1999, sparking rumors that the Seattle e-commerce giant might acquire Drugstore.com. In the end, however, the online drugstore sold to Walgreens and was eventually shut down last fall.\n}}

{{The launch of the GP at Hand app-based primary care service in London has been met with accusations that it is damaging the NHS.\nThe service is being run by a practice in Fulham, but people across central London are able to move their GP registration there. It offers video consultations 24\/7 and face to face appointments at five clinics so far. It uses technology provided by Babylon Health, which bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first AI-driven healthcare service\u201d.\nGP at Hand has been accused of trying to make an easy profit by avoiding the patients who create the most work, threatening the viability of other practices. There have also been concerns that app-based GP services could pull lots of healthy people into the primary care system at the expense of those who really need it.\nThe recent annual conference of England\u2019s local medical committees opposed the rollout of online consulting until there was \u201cclear evidence\u201d of the benefit to patients.\nThe biggest problem with the service is the long list of people who are discouraged from signing on. The website says it may be \u201cless appropriate\u201d for 10 categories of patients, which can reasonably be summarised as people who are, or are likely to be, sick or pregnant. This has been done on the advice of NHS England.\nSeeing a GP on a smartphone sounds wonderful \u2013 but it's not Read more\nThere is some validity in the argument that avoiding the most complex patients means other practices could lose significant income while keeping most of their work. However, the payments to GPs for each patient are weighted in favour of the elderly and women on their list.\nThe NHS has been slothful in using consumer technology for the benefit of patients. For example, people with long-term conditions struggle to get advice on which apps could help them manage their health. NHS Digital is beginning to approve some apps, but rigorous checking is a long process.\nGPs who say online services are a threat to the existing primary care network are right. They will disrupt healthcare just as they have disrupted the media, retail and music. Opposing them when their colleagues have already delivered millions of online consultations is futile.\nBut the way this service and others are being rolled out needs to be reversed. The 2000 Days Project on primary care reform, which I discussed in my last column, highlights the advice of internet evangelist Martha Lane Fox, who argues that healthcare technology should be designed to meet the needs of the people who need it most, not the most people. If the service works for an older person with multiple conditions, it will work for everyone.\nThe NHS needs a digitally savvy workforce to ensure its survival | Harpreet Sood Read more\nSmartphone tech is the best opportunity we will have to get healthcare information, support and access into the hands of the people who need it most. Instead of signing up those who wear a Fitbit to their pilates class, GP apps should be turned into a big, independently run clinical trial targeting precisely the people who are being discouraged from using them.\nSmartphone access for people with serious mental health conditions could save lives. The benefits for frail elderly people are obvious (and can we nail the myth that old people don\u2019t use IT).\nWe need to understand how different types of service user interact with clinicians online, and how online services can be crafted to meet their requirements. We need data on whether fit young people really are clogging up online channels, and the impact of online services on the battle against antimicrobial resistance.\nAt long last the consumer tech revolution is coming to healthcare. It will change primary care skills, training, practice ownership, payment systems, demand, access, outcomes and much more. It could also widen health inequalities if it is handled badly.\nIt is vital for the NHS and the people who need it most that GPs lead and shape this revolution.

{{Al-Watan newspaper\nTHE most recent statistics on human resources in the health sector, which was published by the Ministry of Health about two years ago, indicate that there is a clear shortage of Saudi cadres in healthcare, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians.\nThe statistics revealed the number of Saudi and non-Saudi workers in the health sector including hospitals under the ministry, the National Guard and other government entities.\nWhen we analyze the data we can find that Saudis represent only 26.7 percent of the total number of doctors in the health sector while the ratio of Saudi nurses stood at 36.5 percent. The percentage of Saudi pharmacists stands at 22 percent, representing graduates of pharmacology faculties. On the other hand, the ratio of support staff including technicians and administrators has reached 74.4 percent.\nIn order to get a clear picture of Saudi workforce in the health sector, it is essential to shed light on the distribution of the national cadres in various health divisions in the country.\nThe Ministry of Health represents the largest employer of Saudi health workers as 33.4 percent of doctors, 57.6 percent of nurses and 93.2 percent support staff at its hospitals are Saudi. In hospitals run by the military and security sectors the number of Saudi doctors reached 50.5 percent of the total, while the number of Saudi nurses stood at 14.9 percent, registered pharmacists 65.1 percent, and support staff 70 percent.\nIn the private sector, which is the largest and most important sector considering the government\u2019s move to privatize public hospitals, we see a huge fall in the number of Saudi doctors and other Saudi health workers despite the fact that many Saudis specialized in the field remained jobless.\nSaudi doctors in the private sector account for only 3.3 percent of the total while the percentage of nursing staff stands at 5.3 percent, pharmacists 4.2 percent and support staff 29.9 percent. The data indicates that jobless Saudi health workers can be employed in the private sector if proper measures were taken to Saudize jobs in the sector.\nIt seems the recommendations of the recent health conference organized by the Health Ministry were adopted without understanding the reality on the ground. Regarding Saudi manpower in the health sector, the conference recommended not to open new public and private colleges of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy for the next 12 years until 2030.\nThe conference asked the authorities to reduce the intake into bachelor degree programs in dentistry and pharmacy by 50 percent over the next four years until 2022. It also demanded suspension of scholarships for bachelor degree courses in dentistry, medicine and pharmacy.\n\u201cSuch scholarships should be restricted to postgraduate studies because of an increase in graduates in the above disciplines in excess of labor market requirements,\u201d the conference said, adding that the number of graduates in the above disciplines was more than the training capacity of government and private hospitals.\nLack of training has weakened the capabilities of Saudi medical graduates, thus contributing to their unemployment, the conference observed. However, it called for increasing admission of students to courses in family medicine and nursing.\nNow the question is whether these recommendations conform to our aspirations to increase the percentage of Saudi workers in the health sector. Do these recommendations serve our developmental aspirations in light of the overwhelming deficit of Saudi healthcare personnel in the private sector?\nWe should also study whether there is any actual increase in the number of graduates in the above health disciplines and whether their number stands higher than what is required by the labor market especially when we notice a remarkable fall in the number of Saudi health workers in the private sector.\nWith regard to the issue of lack of training received by Saudi doctors, we should know that there are 470 hospitals in the Kingdom by the end of 2016 including 274 under the Ministry of Health, 44 with other government agencies, and 152 in the private sector. Are these hospitals not enough to provide training to medical graduates or are the private hospitals exempted from providing training facilities to them?\nWe pin great hope on the Health, Education, Civil Service and Labor ministries to increase the percentage of Saudi health workers in public and private hospitals. In order to achieve this goal, we have to increase the intake of students in our medical colleges and at the same time employ Saudi graduates in all available positions, offering them attractive salaries and benefits.\nEfforts must also be made to provide them with training, workshops and special courses to sit qualifying examinations to obtain professional licenses. This will help reduce the big gap between Saudi and non-Saudi workers in the health sector and achieve our strategic vision.\n}}

{{Healthcare is a major burden for Americans of all ages. From health insurance premiums to doctor and emergency room visits to prescription costs, the price of medical care has skyrocketed over the years, and workers and retirees alike are feeling the pain. Case in point: A good 25% of U.S. adults struggle to pay their medical bills, and medical debt is the No. 1 cause of personal bankruptcy filings in the country.\nIf your goal is to save money on healthcare, then you'll want to attack the problem from multiple angles. Here's how.\n1. Shop around for better insurance\nWhen it comes to health coverage, you tend to get what you pay for. Now, if you're the type who rarely gets sick, it often pays to buy a plan with a lower monthly premium and higher deductible. But if you tend to use your insurance a lot, a lower deductible might be the way to go. There's also the coverage itself to consider. Paying a little more money in premium costs could buy you a superior range of coverage, which could then end up saving you on out-of-pocket expenses during the year.\nIt's helpful to shop around for insurance, especially if you're buying it yourself on the open market, because there may be a plan out there that better suits your needs and lowers your total costs. The same holds true if your employer offers a plan with multiple tiers. Either way, don't assume that cheaper is better when it comes to health insurance, because less expensive plans often cost you in other ways.\n2. Lower your prescription costs\nIf you take prescription drugs, you may have some options for keeping their costs to a minimum. For one thing, always ask your provider to prescribe a generic. An estimated 90% of generic drug copays cost less than $20, compared to just 39% of brand-name copays. Furthermore, if it's a drug you take regularly, see about ordering 90-day supplies as opposed to renewing your prescription in 30-day increments. Some plans offer a huge discount for ordering pills in bulk.\n3. Examine your medical bills\nMedical offices aren't perfect, and sometimes all it takes is an improper procedure code for you to get stuck with a healthcare bill that's higher than it needs to be. That's why it's crucial to review all health-related charges you receive prior to paying your bills. Along these lines, if your insurance company refuses to pay for a service it's covered before, it's always smart to follow up and ask why. Often, claims get rejected due to improper coding, so do a little digging before busting out your checkbook.\n4. Understand your health benefits\nIt's estimated that only 52% of workers really understand their health benefits. If you have questions about what your plan does and doesn't cover, dial the number on the back of your insurance card and ask someone -- that's what those representatives are there for.\nImagine you need a procedure that requires preauthorization. If you fail to take that step and go forward with it, you might wind up with a sizable bill. Similarly, if you accidentally see a provider who is considered out of network, you could end up paying far more for that service than you would for an in-network provider. Spending some time to review your benefits could save you a bundle, so it's a worthwhile investment.\n5. Get ahead of health issues before they escalate\nWhether due to being busy or a desire to avoid that pesky copay, how many times have you skipped out on going to the doctor upon first getting sick, only to cave several days later when your symptoms got worse? It happens pretty often. In fact, 20% of Americans admit that they're able to avoid high medical costs, at least initially, by not seeking treatment. The problem with this approach, however, is that if you ignore medical issues, they can often become costlier to address later on.\nImagine you come down with a bad cough that gives you grief for days, yet you ignore it and stay away from the doctor. If it evolves into pneumonia and you wind up in the hospital for it, you might pay thousands of dollars for that stay, as opposed to the $35 copay your doctor's office would've charged. Though there's no need to run to the doctor every time you sneeze or sniffle, don't neglect more serious health issues. You'll prolong your misery, and very possibly could cost yourself more money in the long run.\n6. Open a flexible spending account\nIf you work for a company that offers a flexible spending account (FSA), signing up could save you money. The reason? FSA dollars go in tax-free, and for the current year, you can contribute up to $2,650 to pay for things like in-office copays, prescription drugs, and eyeglasses. The only caveat is that if you overestimate your out-of-pocket costs and contribute too much to your FSA, you risk forfeiting your balance. But if you're smart about how much you put into that account, you could slash your medical spending for the year via that tax break.\nImagine your effective tax rate is 25%, and you contribute $2,000 to your FSA. Doing so will put $500 back into your pocket -- and that's a decent saving.\n7. Sign up for a health savings account\nIf you have a high-deductible insurance plan, you might be eligible for a health savings account, or HSA. Like an FSA, the money you contribute goes in pre-tax, and you can use it to pay for qualifying medical expenses. But when you're not using that money, you get to invest it, thus growing that sum. Unlike FSAs, you can roll over your HSA balance from year to year, and the current annual contribution limits are much higher than that of an FSA: $3,450 for individuals and $6,900 for family coverage.\nSaving money on healthcare can alleviate a lot of the financial stress so many Americans experience. So follow these tips to lower your medical costs -- your budget and health depend on it.\n}}

{{U.S. prosecutors have charged 49 current and former Russian diplomats and their family members with participating in a scheme to get health benefits intended for the poor by lying about their income.\nThe charges come against a backdrop of tense exchanges between Russia and the United States over law enforcement actions in both countries.\nAccording to the charges, filed in November and unsealed on Thursday, the diplomats\u2019 families got around $1.5 million in benefits from the Medicaid program for families with low monthly incomes \u2013 in many cases around $3,000 or less. The benefits covered costs related to pregnancies, births and infant care, the charges say.\nMeanwhile, according to the charges, the family members had their housing costs paid for by the Russian government and spent \u201ctens of thousands of dollars\u201d on vacations, jewelry and luxury goods from stores like Swarovski and Jimmy Choo.\nEach of the 49 people was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and one count of conspiracy to steal government funds and make false statements relating to healthcare matters, according to the charges.\n\u201cWe are puzzled by the stovepiping of information to the media about accusations against Russian diplomatic mission officials in the U.S.,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax news agency.\n\u201cOne does not understand why the (U.S.) institutions involved considered it possible to make these accusations public without discussing (them) through diplomatic channels.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Peter Donald, said no one was arrested.\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a Manhattan press conference that the U.S. State Department would have had to request a waiver of immunity from Russia in order for U.S. authorities to arrest the defendants. If no waiver is granted, Bharara said the State Department can insist that the defendants leave the country.\n\u201cDiplomacy should be about extending hands, not picking pockets in the host country,\u201d he said.\nBharara declined to say how the charges might affect U.S.-Russia relations. He said his office has not been in contact with the White House.\nA spokeswoman for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Russian mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment on the case.\nTRYING TO QUALIFY\nThe charges say the defendants obtained letters to prove their false incomes from officials at the Russian U.N. mission, including a former counselor and a former second secretary, as well as from former top officials at the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in New York and the Trade Representation of the Russian Federation in the USA.\nOnly two of the seven officials who allegedly signed off on the income letters are identified in the charges by name. The other five are referred to as unidentified co-conspirators.\nTimur Salomatin, a former Russian diplomat at the U.N., and his wife Nailya Babaeva, said they made $3,000 a month when Salomatin\u2019s U.N. salary was actually $5,160 per month, according to the charges.\nAnother couple, Andrey Kalinin and Irina Shirshova, lied about their income and monthly housing costs in order to be deemed eligible for Medicaid and also sought benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, which subsidizes the cost of some types of foods and education. According to the charges, the family received more than $23,000 in Medicaid benefits over about three years.\nSome families also lied about their newborns\u2019 citizenship status, the charges say, because children born to many diplomats and their spouses do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship the way others do.\nBLACKLISTS\nHundreds of Russian diplomats and their families live in a compound in the Riverdale neighborhood in the Bronx. Three dozen of the defendants lived in Russian-owned housing in the Bronx, according to the complaint.\nBharara said only 11 are still in the United States; ten are diplomats with the Russian Mission to the U.N. and their spouses, and one is now stationed at the Russian embassy in Washington.\nRussia has in recent years accused the United States of biased and politically motivated prosecution of its citizens, including jailed arms dealer Viktor Bout and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking.\nIn response to a U.S. law enacted in December 2012 that bars Russians seen as human rights abusers from entering the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off that same month on a similar law barring Americans, including some U.S. Justice Department officials, from Russia. Bharara is among those banned from Russia.\nReuters\n}}

I wanted to preface the article with some of the patents owned by Intrexon to give readers an opportunity to attempt to value and understand the vast amount of intellectual property owned by the company.\nXOGENEX\nFirst, we will explore Xogenex which is targeting cardiac disease with its phase 1 multi-genic drug INXN-4001. Heart disease is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients aged 65+ and represents an absolutely staggering market opportunity with 25 million patients worldwide.\nThe drug INXN-4001 used a triple effector plasmid for treating heart failure. This addresses multiple malfunctions of cardiomyocytes in patients with heart disease\/failure and is differentiated by other therapies that only target one malfunction.\nCurrently the phase 1 program will have a total of 12 subjects that are followed for 12 months post treatment. The study centers include the University of Arizona and the Montefiore Hospital.\nXogenex has since released two snippets of data around the first patents that were dosed and the early indications are quite promising.\nWithin 3 months patients dosed with INXN-4001 have shown increased blood flow and improvement in overall heart function. In the February 28, 2019 Q4 results call data from a third patient that was dosed was also shown.\nThis snippet of data with early dosing shows that severe dysfunction in a patient has improved to only mild dysfunction within a 6 month time frame. If we are to assume dosing and scheduling optimization can further impact the results Xogenex may disrupt the current cardiac failure marketplace. I am keeping an eye out for more data as trials continue to progress.\nShould results show safety in phase 1 trials and early indications of efficacy continue this therapeutic opportunity will be worth significantly more than Intrexon's market capitalization at the time of writing this article (~$700M).\nACTOBIO\nActobio is focused on development of their Actobiotics platform which is a unique food based delivery platform for therapeutics using the L.lactis bacteria as a drug delivery mechanism at disease sites including the intestine, mouth and nasopharynx.\nTwo key product candidates in the Actobio pipeline include AG013 (partnered with Oragenics) to treat oral mucositis and AG019 to treat Type 1 Diabetes.\nAGO013 treats oral mucositis which impacts 850k+ patients who are undergoing chemotherapy treatment which leads to problems including pain, inability to eat, and increased risk of infection due to open sores in the mucosa. Some photos showing the condition are included below\nIn a phase 1B clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013 was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal Cancer showed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative OM (source: Oragenics.com).\nAG013 was granted Fast Track designation with the US FDA and orphan drug status in Europe. Further in 2018, the FDA approved a phase 2 trial in which approximately 200 patients will be randomized to receive either AG013 or a placebo.\nAs per a 2018 article, the estimated size of the OM market is >$1 billion US annually. Thus representing another opportunity for an Intrexon healthcare asset that exceeds its current market capitalization.\nThe second opportunity that we will explore in the Actobio portfolio is around Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). As per the LA Children's Hospital, T1D accounts for over $14.9 billion in healthcare costs with the treatment market alone expected to expand to $13.6 billion by 2023.\nThough there are currently ways to manage the disease there is no cure available for the underlying condition.\nAs per a 2018 news release \"AG019 is formulated as an easy-to-take capsule consisting of engineered Lactococcus lactis specifically modified to deliver human proinsulin and the tolerance-enhancing cytokine human interleukin-10 to the mucosal lining of the gastro-intestinal tissues. The microbe-based platform offers several advantages over injectable biologics including a unique delivery method of a therapeutic agent capable of inducing oral immune tolerance to reverse T1D. Pre-clinical studies in mice have demonstrated that AG019, in association with a short-term treatment with systemic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, successfully induced reversion to normal blood sugar levels in 60% of diabetic mice, and effectively reversed the disease in 89% of mice treated at early stage.\" (source)\nIf successful, this opportunity represents another multi-billion dollar therapy in Intrexon's healthcare portfolio.\nAnother potential partnership solution for Actobio is to use their drug delivery platform for existing therapeutics in a partnership. Which leads us to discussing the numerous opportunities for the largest Intrexon healthcare asset, Precigen.\nPrecigen\nThe crown jewel of the portfolio is Precigen. Precigen recently received approval for two first-in-human trials for AML, MDS; and for Platinum resistant Ovarian Cancer in the last 3 months.\nI have included an image of the current Precigen portfolio below.\nPrecigen technology platforms allow for it to construct, deliver and control various gene therapy programs.\nFirst I will explore the UltraCar-T platform and the Adenoverse delivery solution. These drug delivery platforms and solutions are extremely important to our understanding of Precigen's pipeline. If we are to take an extremely bias approach to Precigen's gene constructs, the delivery solutions and platform alone carries immense value.\nThe UltraCar-T platform is a transformative technology with the ability to disrupt the current Car-T market. In 2017and 2018 two groundbreaking deals in the Car-T space were announced with Gilead acquiring Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion and Celgene acquiring Juno for $9 billion. In both of these deals the Car-T technology being used requires centralized manufacturing and wait times sometimes in excess of 3 months before a patient can be treated. Further, they are extremely expensive and even are being rejected by some geographies due to the cost of treatment.\nPrecigen's UltraCar-T can be manufactured in a decentralized fashion and takes only 2 days before a patient can be treated. Further, the method can incorporate a kill switch to turn off the gene therapy or Intrexon's proprietary Rheoswitch which can turn off and on the gene therapy being delivered.\nOn the February 28, 2019 earnings call an analyst asked if the two day processing of the UltraCar-T platform is achievable today or requires further technological developments and it was confirmed that it was \"totally achievable today\". If the rest of Precigen's portfolio doesn't pan out, the UltraCar-T technology would be a huge asset to existing players in the Car-T landscape.\nThe AdenoVerse Vaccine is also showing tremendous therapeutic benefit in initial results. In comparison to competitor vaccines and even using competitor products in the AdenoVerse delivery system showed significant improvements to existing technology.\nAgain, if Precigen's gene constructs do not work, there is value in the delivery platform for existing vaccines.\nExploring the portfolio further, Precigen released data of PRGN-5001 in direct comparison to an already approved Anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor and showed that the PRGN-5001 multifunctional therapeutic candidate has significantly better efficacy in T-Cell activation.\nAssuming that the already approved inhibitor that was used in this study was Keytruda, Opdivo, or Libtayo, early results indicate that the Precigen technology is substantially better than all three of these drugs which accounts for multi-billion dollars in sales annually. The 2019 projections for Opdivo and Keytruda alone are upwards of $15 billion in annual sales.\nDrugs recently approved for phase 1 trials also showed efficacy in both liquid and solid tumors in-vivo models. For me, the more interesting of the two is PRGN-3005 which targets solid tumors. These results are compared against traditional mbIL15 Car-T therapies which have little efficacy on tumor burden, the PRGN-3005 solution showed significant antitumor effects in early clinical research.\nIf this trial is proven successful for platinum resistant Ovarian Cancer tumors, Precigen should be able to target other solid tumors effectively, which would instantly turn it to the largest oncology company in the world.\nPRGN-3006 also now entering phase 1 trials showed efficacy in liquid tumors in mice models in comparison to traditional CAR-T treatments as shown below.\nConclusion\nIntrexon owns one of the leading healthcare pipelines in the world when it comes to address unmet medical needs. Coupled with industry leading patents and technology should Intrexon be successful in even a few of their current healthcare ventures the upside is tremendous in providing scalable solutions in multiple markets.\nIntrexon will need to partner with a big pharma company or raise money (through partnerships, sale, or revenue) to continue to drive their healthcare assets forward in the clinic.\nRecently the company disclosed going concern language in their latest conference call. Though executives stated that this was only there for language and they believe the future of the company is strong.\nA criticism of Intrexon so far has been that they have great technology and intellectual property but need better execution with their existing assets.\nI believe that the healthcare portfolio alone is worth more than Intrexon's current market cap and in my next article I will further examine Intrexon's Methane Bioconversion (Energy) platform. Ultimately assigning a sum of the parts value and price target for $XON.\nDisclosure: I am\/we are long XON. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.\n}}

{{Healthcare has been one of the best-performing sectors in 2014, and investors are right to question whether stocks in the industry will continue their winning ways in 2015. While increasing share prices have made many healthcare companies a bit pricey, these five stocks offer enticing valuations and intriguing reasons that could make them worth considering for portfolios.\n1. Overcoming an obstacle\nTeva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) is the globe's biggest maker of generic drugs, but it's also a major manufacturer of specialty medicines.\nCopaxone, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis relapses, is a multibillion-dollar blockbuster that represents 20% of Teva's annual sales. Copaxone is the most widely prescribed therapy for MS patients, with $4 billion in annual sales; however, fears regarding Copaxone losing patent protection this year caused Teva's shares to fall sharply in 2012 and 2013. Although the risk of a generic competitor remains, the stock has climbed nicely this year given that the Food and Drug Administration has been slow to approve a generic biosimilar, and Teva has been very successful at converting Copaxone patients to a new, longer-lasting formulation of the drug that remains under patent protection. In this context, Teva shares could offer a significant opportunity. Currently, investors will pay just 11.34 times next year's earnings per share to own stock in the company.\n2. Building on its lead\nThanks to the December 2013 launch of Sovaldi, a highly anticipated hepatitis C therapy, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) shares have performed strongly this year. Sovaldi notched more than $8 billion in sales through the first nine months of this year, putting it on pace to challenge AbbVie's Humira as the world's top-selling medicine.\nDespite Sovaldi's success, investors worried that competitors working on alternative hepatitis C drugs will eat away at Gilead Sciences' market share have kept a lid on the company's valuation. Shares are trading at just 10.6 times next year's expected earnings. That valuation suggests there's plenty of room for upside.\nGilead Sciences won FDA approval of Harvoni, its second-generation hepatitis C drug, in October. Analysts believe the drug, which clears hepatitis C in up to 99% of patients, will in 2015 rack up sales similar to what Sovaldi recorded this year. If so, Gilead Sciences' earnings per share could total $9.95 in 2015, up 25% from this year.\n3. Capitalizing on a bargain\nHorizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP) might not be as big as Teva Pharmaceutical, or as well known as Gilead Sciences, but it could be a nice value stock to own next year.\nThanks to some savvy acquisitions, including the 2013 purchase from AstraZeneca of commercial rights to the rheumatoid arthritis drug Vimovo, analysts think Horizon's growth might drive EPS up from $0.81 in 2014 to $1.04 in 2015.\nHorizon paid AstraZeneca just $35 million for Vimovo, betting that its existing rheumatology sales force could significantly increase sales of the drug. That bet seems to be paying off, as Vimovo's sales reached $43.2 million in the third quarter, for a total of $119.6 million through the first nine months of the year.\n4. More paying customers\nAcquiring Health Management Associates early this year turned Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) into one of the nation's top hospital operators.\nHospitals operators such as Community Health struggled during the recession as budget-strapped patients put off elective surgery and the number of write-offs for the uninsured jumped. However, the economic recovery and growing health insurance enrollment tied to the Affordable Care Act is resulting in admissions growth and a drop-off in charity care.\nCommunity Health's trailing 12-month operating margin improved from about 5.6% in the first quarter of the year to nearly 6.5% in the third quarter. The amount of money set aside for doubtful accounts fell from 14.4% of its gross sales last year to 13.8%.\nThat trend should persist in 2015 as admission growth continues and more people sign up for insurance through the ACA's federal and state exchanges or through Medicaid. As a result, analysts think Community Health will deliver EPS of $3.97 next year, up from $3.21 this year. That would give the company a forward P\/E ratio of just 13.05 and a price-to-sales ratio of just 0.34.\n5. More members and higher prices\nCigna (NYSE:CI) took a measured approach to the Obamacare health insurance exchanges during the first enrollment period, participating in just five states. But this year, Cigna insurance plans will be offered in three more states , and that could provide a nice lift to the company's revenue and profit next year. Ultimately, Cigna believes insurance plans offered on the exchanges will offer an operating margin of between 3% and 5%. Thanks to price increases for 2015, the company could see those offerings become profitable sooner rather than later.\nAdditionally, while many of its peers generate revenue solely from health insurance, Cigna also has a booming supplemental insurance business in Asia. That business, which offers health, life, and accident insurance products, has grown by 19% annually over the past five years.\nGrowing enrollment in exchange plans and higher demand for supplemental policies has Wall Street expecting that Cigna's EPS will reach $8.14 in 2015, up from $7.39 this year. That works out to a forward P\/E of just 12.8 times.\nReasonably priced growth\nThe healthcare sector has an opportunity for growth again in 2015, and a variety of healthcare investments could pay off for investors. Teva Pharmaceutical, Horizon Pharma, Gilead Sciences, Community Health Systems, and Cigna provide investors with exposure to different areas of healthcare, and each is arguably inexpensive relative to the earnings growth expected in 2015. For that reason, investors might want to consider placing these stocks in their portfolios.\n}}

{{SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - At its Silicon Valley headquarters, network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc is going to unusual lengths to take control of the relentless increase in its U.S. healthcare costs.\nThe inside of a Walgreens-operated pharmacy is seen at a Cisco health clinic at Cisco Systems in San Jose, California, U.S., March 22, 2018. Picture taken March 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\nThe company is among a handful of large American employers who are getting more deeply involved in managing their workers\u2019 health instead of looking to insurers to do it. Cisco last year began offering its employees a plan it negotiated directly with nearby Stanford Health medical system.\nUnder the plan, physicians are supposed to keep costs down by closely tracking about a dozen health indicators to prevent expensive emergencies, and keep Cisco workers happy with their care. If they meet these goals, Stanford gets a bonus. If they fail, Stanford pays Cisco a penalty.\nAt the center of it all is a spacious clinic inside Cisco\u2019s San Jose campus, the first point of contact for many employees and their families. They often see Dr. Larry Kwan, a Stanford Health general physician who rubs shoulders with workers in the cafeteria and company gym.\n\u201cI\u2019m in their space. I\u2019m actually where they work,\u201d Dr. Kwan said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a village doc.\u201d\nCisco said costs for Stanford plan patients are 10 percent lower than conventional coverage still used by most of its employees. Chipmaker Intel Corp told Reuters it is saving 17 percent on its workers enrolled in a similar plan, known as Connected Care. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and Walmart Inc, the world\u2019s largest retailer, have likewise hammered out health plans directly with providers.\nThe movement is small, just a few very large U.S. corporations that have signed up tens of thousands of workers so far. Their early efforts show the challenges of changing behaviors among patients and doctors.\nBut they speak volumes about corporate America\u2019s frustration with inexorably rising medical costs and the traditional insurers that sell them coverage.\n\u201cBefore they were simply saying \u2018Okay, our vendor is going to help us with this,\u2019\u201d said John Jackson, who handles corporate programs like Cisco\u2019s for Stanford Health. \u201cMany are no longer willing to do that.\u201d\nCorporations help pay for healthcare for more than 170 million Americans, in most cases working with an insurer to handle everything from the price of treatments to medical claims.\nThese employers will spend an estimated $738 billion on health benefits in 2018, a figure that has been rising about 5 percent annually in recent years, according to federal data.\nCUE AMAZON\nOther big firms are watching closely. Amazon.com Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Berkshire Hathaway Inc said in January they will form an independent company to improve healthcare for their roughly 750,000 U.S. employees, prompting speculation that they would displace health insurers and other industry \u201cmiddlemen\u201d.\nAmazon and partners say they will use big-data analysis and other high-tech tools to improve care and cut wasteful spending. The trio will study the new plans coming from Intel and other pioneers, a source close to the venture told Reuters.\nIf they do, they will find plenty of hurdles. Reuters interviews with executives at Cisco, Intel and Boeing and their health partners revealed similar challenges.\nChief among them is habit. Many workers will not stray from conventional plans because they like their doctors or worry about access to the best specialists.\nTo boost enrollment, all three companies have dangled sweeteners such as extra money for health savings accounts or lower monthly premiums and co-pays. The approach also requires employers to take a more hands-on role.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you just turn the switch and not manage,\u201d said Katelyn Johnson, Cisco\u2019s senior integrated health manager for global benefits.\nCisco\u2019s experiment began in 2008 when it opened the campus clinic for all of its employees there. Designed like a spa, the facility offered primary care in new-age sounding treatment areas: body, mind, heart and spirit.\nThe savings were notable: about 30 percent compared to an offsite doctor\u2019s office. Cisco later brought in Stanford to develop a full-blown medical plan, which took effect in 2017. Stanford operates the clinic and provides more specialized services through Stanford University\u2019s medical system.\nLike a health maintenance organization, the plan requires enrollees to stick to a closed network of doctors. There is emphasis on primary care and fewer referrals to specialists. Treatment for back pain, for example, often begins with physical therapy at the clinic.\nCisco also mandates that Stanford track a dozen health measures, including glycemic levels for diabetics and blood pressure for those with hypertension.\nJohnson said fewer than 1,000 people are enrolled, below Cisco\u2019s goal of 1,300 for 2018. The plan has yet to make a dent in Cisco\u2019s $500 million annual healthcare tab, which has been rising by 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.\nStill, Cisco is encouraged enough by the savings that it may expand the program to the company\u2019s second-largest U.S. center, in North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle Park.\n\u201cWhat we were doing in the past wasn\u2019t really working,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo this model ... is worth it.\u201d\nCHIPPING AWAY AT CHALLENGES\nExperts warn Cisco\u2019s approach is not suitable for most employers.\nFor starters, companies need thousands of employees in one place, usually a city, said David Muhlestein, Chief Research Officer at healthcare consultancy Leavitt Partners in Washington D.C. Then their healthcare partner needs to be committed to improving patient health, rather than just offering a discount to win a big client.\n\u201cThere are not a ton of providers who are really well positioned to make those changes,\u201d Muhlestein said.\nSanta Clara, Calif.-based Intel says it has found such partners since it launched its Connected Care health plan five years ago. About 38,000 employees and dependents are now enrolled in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Oregon.\nTechnology is critical to curbing costs. In Oregon, patients are encouraged to use video conferencing to speak with physicians when appropriate. At $49, the cost is one-third of an office visit.\nJennifer Leo, a 41-year old Intel project manager in Hillsboro, Oregon, chose Connected Care mainly because it covers 100 percent of her husband\u2019s insulin, a drug whose U.S. retail price has more than doubled over the past five years.\nHospital network Providence Health & Services tracks her husband\u2019s condition closely. But Leo said she, too, got personal attention when she came down with a sinus infection on a weekend.\nShe booked a quick video appointment with a doctor, who prescribed an antibiotic. The next day, the office of her primary care physician reached out to \u201ccheck that everything got taken care of,\u201d Leo said.\nSuch follow-through has led to high patient satisfaction; Connected Care boasts a 95 percent enrollee retention rate, says Angela Mitchell, Intel\u2019s head of U.S. healthcare delivery.\nAnd it has curbed costs and boosted patient health, she said. Last year, for example, 78 percent of diabetics on the plan had their sugar levels under control, up from 69 percent in 2016, Mitchell said. Spending on people with the most complex health conditions was about 10 percentage points lower than on those with comparable issues outside the plan.\nIntel spent nearly $700 million on healthcare last year, up about 1 percent from $690 million in 2016.\nStill, Intel employees will sometimes ask Mitchell for help when they cannot see specialists quickly enough. In some cases, she will intervene and call the health system directly to make it happen.\n\u201cThere are thousands of doctors in these networks. We\u2019re not trying to act like it\u2019s perfect every single time,\u201d Mitchell said.\nBoeing, too, has hit some snags with plans it negotiated directly with hospitals in four states covering 15,000 employees plus family members.\nDoctors have willingly prescribed cheaper generic drugs, says Boeing global healthcare head Jeff White. But getting them to commit to, say, physical therapy first before scheduling a costly knee replacement has been harder, he said.\nWhite said direct arrangements have boosted quality and saved Boeing money; he declined to provide exact figures. The aircraft maker spends about $2.4 billion annually on healthcare for more than 120,000 U.S. workers and their dependents.\nSome healthcare experts point to the inherent conflict for providers: If they prevent expensive health crises through better care, they also lose out on more profitable services, such as hospital admissions.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge of trying to ask the health system to save money,\u201d said Jack Hoadley, a health policy expert at Georgetown University.\n}}

{{Healthcare is the most dangerous industry for injuries and illnesses, with 653,000 nurses, aides, orderlies and others injured or falling ill every year, according to a new Public Citizen Report.\nForty-five percent of all workplace violence incidents in the USA that result in lost workdays occur in the health care sector. Among attendants, orderlies, and nursing aides in 2011, the incidence rate of injuries requiring days off work was 486 cases per 10,000 employees, over four times higher than the national average for all workers.\nEven though health care workplaces are more dangerous than anywhere else, OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) carries out relatively few inspections of health care facilities. The authors added that even when it does find safety problems, there is often not much OSHA can do because of \"an absence of much needed safety standards\".\nCo-author, Keith Wrightson, a worker safety and health advocate for Public Citizen, said \"OSHA is required by law to ensure safe conditions for every employee in the United States. The record is clear that the government has broken its promise to health care workers.\"\nMore musculoskeletal injuries are suffered by orderlies, attendants, nurses and nursing aides than workers in any other industry. Back injuries in the health care industry are estimated to cost over $7 billion every year.\nDr. L. Toni Lewis, chair of the health care division of the Service Employees International Union, which advised Public Citizen on the report, said:\n\"Most Americans are not aware that hospitals and other medical facilities are actually the most frequent site for workplace injuries. This is an issue that affects so many frontline workers and their patients - nurses, CNAs, radiologists, physical therapists - women and men who are trying to meet the needs of their patients safely and effectively. The current patchwork approach is not working for workers.\"\nIn 2010, there were 152,000 workplace injuries and illnesses in the manufacturing sector, compared to a whopping 653,000 in health care.\nThe industry with the most inspections, construction, has been criticized for not having enough OSHA inspections and enforcements.\nHealth care, the most people and fewest inspections\nThe two stark statistics below clearly show how desperately in need the healthcare industry is for safety regulations, inspections and enforcements:\nHealth care has twice as many workers as construction\nFor every OSHA inspection in health care facilities, there are more than 20 in construction sites. There were 52,179 construction site inspections in 2011 compared to just 2,504 in health care and social assistance facilities.\nSuzy Harrington, director of the American Nurses Association's Department for Health, Safety and Wellness, said:\n\"It's alarming that health care workers rank right alongside laborers, truck drivers and other physical, labor-intensive jobs in terms of musculoskeletal injuries. This is a primary reason health care workers leave direct patient care. We can't afford to lose health care workers to injury and still meet rising demands for health care services.\"\nAssistant Secretary of Labor, David Michaels, who is also head of OSHA, said in 2012 regarding the safety problems that need to be addressed in health care \"It is unacceptable that the workers who have dedicated their lives to caring for our loved ones when they are sick are the very same workers who face the highest risk of work-related injury and illness.\"\nWhen preparing the report, Public Citizen asked OSHA why it is not more involved in raising standards in health care workplaces, OSHA responded \"At this time, OSHA is not pursuing a rule on safe patient handling for health care workers. We continue to be concerned about this serious issue and promote sensible solutions through the National Emphasis Program, guidance, and outreach activities. However, OSHA does not have resources to move forward on all rulemaking necessary to address all the pressing workplace health and safety hazards.\"\nThe report blames Congress\nYears of repetitive strain increase the risk of\ncareer-ending injuries for health care workers\nThe authors say that Congress is to blame for OSHA for not being able to protect health care workers. OSHA's budget of $535million is \"woefully inadequate\" to monitor 7 million job sites.\nIn 2000, the authors wrote that after OSHA published a final standard to protect all workers in every industry from ergonomic stressors, Congress repealed the rule before it came into effect.\nAt the beginning of the Obama administration, OSHA proposed a rule to \"add a column on employers' incident reporting logs to designate whether workplace injuries were musculoskeletal disorders.\" The administration dragged its feet until Congress finally blocked it.\nOSHA is trying to address the injury rates among nursing home workers with a \"National Emphasis Program\" (NEP), which aims to address ergonomic stressors, falls, trips, slips, workplace violence, tuberculosis and bloodborne pathogens. However, NEP does not cover health care settings, not even hospitals, where injury rates are particularly high.\nBuilding Massachusetts General Hospital is\nsafer than working in it as a nurse\nAs there is no specific standard for ergonomic safety in the health care industry, OSHA has to rely on its catch-all \"general duty clause\" to issue citations for unsafe working conditions.\nOver the last two fiscal years only seven citations regarding ergonomics have been issued to nursing homes, the authors revealed.\nThe report recommends that OSHA increase the number of inspections of health care facilities significantly (\"several fold\") and \"pursue binding standards to ensure that workers are protected from the risks posed by musculoskeletal disorders, workplace violence and other threats.\"\nThe authors also urge Congress to increase OSHA's funding \"significantly\".\nStatement by the American Nurses Association (ANA)\nIn an online communiqu\u00e9, the American Nurses Association wrote that an enormous number of health care workers are suffering preventable back, shoulder and neck injuries from manual patient handling. Workers and their managers often are not aware that these potentially career-ending injuries commonly occur after years of repetitive strain, rather than from one event.\nWhy should a nurse consider moving a 90-pound person up in bed as quick and easy when no other profession would see that weight as \"light\"? In no other sector would a 90-pound weight be lifted without mechanical support.\nThe ANA added \"Research shows that the use of assistive technology reduces injuries to workers and patients, and lowers costs attributable to workers' compensation, lost productivity, and turnover.\"\nWritten by Christian Nordqvist\n}}

{{The Medical Society of New Jersey has filed a lawsuit to block the merger of Oxford Health Plans (NJ), Inc. and UnitedHealthcare Inc., claiming it would create a health care monopoly that would not benefit consumers.\nThe filing of the lawsuit effectively stays the merger in the state, pending a ruling by a judge of the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey whether the acquisition by UnitedHealthcare should be allowed to proceed.\nWithin days of the final hearing on the matter, Banking and Insurance Commissioner Holly Bakke approved the $3.7 billion merger. The combination would create the third-largest health insurer in New Jersey. A total of 440,620 policyholders are covered by the two companies, according to the state.\nAccording to the medical society, the projected statewide market share of the merged entity approaches 20 percent, and it will be significantly greater in New Jersey\u2019s six northern counties (Bergen, Essex, Passaic, Sussex, Union, Morris) where the vast majority of United\u2019s and Oxford\u2019s insured base is currently located. The market shares in these regions violate anti-competitive guidelines set by the state\u2019s attorney general, the doctors have charged.\n\u201cUnlike the state of New Jersey, physicians are accustomed to advocating for patients, which is why we take legal action today,\u201d said Michael T. Kornett, executive director nd chief executive officer,, MSNJ. \u201cPatients deserve to get the tests, treatment and prescriptions they need when they need them. People are paying more for their health care, and should demand more. After having to jump managed care bureaucratic hurdles for years, physicians and patients have had enough.\u201d\nBakke said the decision to approve the merger come after a thorough review. Insurance regulators said combining the companies would bring increased efficiencies that could result in lower costs and improved access to health care. She also stressed the importance of the marketplace\u2019s responsibility to preserve access to healthcare and address the issue of the uninsured.\nThe merger of the health care companies has also been approved by California, Connecticut and New York.\nIn filings submitted to New Jersey department as part of the application process, MSNJ had encouraged Bakke to apply more restrictive New Jersey guidelines to determine whether a merger will substantially lessen competition and be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.\n\u201cThese two companies systematically interfere in the patient\/physician\nrelationship, so much so that MSNJ is in court now with both of them for unfair and deceptive business practices,\u201d continued Kornett. \u201cThis acquisition intensify United\u2019s power over patients and providers, leading to even more one-sided contracts and medical decisions made by clerks \u2013 not physicians. With less available health care, we will see increased costs to the patients, employers, labor organizations and others who purchase insurance in New Jersey.\n\u201cIt is quite obvious that this was a pre-determined and politically\nmotivated decision,\u201d added Kornett. \u201cWe trust that the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey will take a very close look at the far-reaching implications and impacts of this merger and decide in the favor of New Jersey patients.\u201d\nUnder New Jersey law, the proposed acquisition must complete a seven-prong test. Bakke said she found that none of the seven statutory disqualifiers existed in this filing or public hearing. These include:\n\u2022 If the acquired company will be able to continue to maintain its license as an HMO in New Jersey;\n\u2022 Whether the acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the New Jersey health insurance market or create a monopoly;\n\u2022 If the financial condition of both merging companies will be jeopardized due to a merger;\n\u2022 Whether a merger will create changes in the corporate structure of both companies, which would be unfair or unreasonable to the acquired company\u2019s policyholders; or if the merger is not in the public\u2019s best interest;\n\u2022 The new leadership spurred from a merger must prove to be competent and possess the requisite ability to run the newly formed company; and\n\u2022 The merger must not be hazardous or prejudicial to New Jersey consumers.\nThe department found that the merger would result in various efficiencies that would enable a combined entity to achieve lower costs in reimbursement rates and administration than it could have achieved as separate companies. This could allow the combined company to offer health plans at a lower price, according to officials.\n}}

{{Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell has unveiled the latest bid to improve design quality in the public sector.\nSpeaking at the AJ100 Breakfast Club in London this morning, the cabinet minister revealed CABE's latest campaign, called Designed with Care, which aims to force up standards in healthcare architecture.\nWhile the campaign will also look at large-scale hospital design, the main focus will be on smaller projects, such as primary healthcare centres and buildings for the treatment of people with mental illness.\n'Design of housing is still woefully poor in many cases,' said Jowell, 'but also in some healthcare projects. We are lagging behind places like Spain and we could be setting ourselves up for a fall.\n'This is why today I am delighted to announce CABE's latest campaign, Designed with Care. It will raise standards in healthcare design.'\nThe campaign will be launched with a new report of the same name, which will come out later this week. It assesses where healthcare design currently stands in the UK and where it ought to be.\nThe study deals with healthcare design in a manner similar to that used by CABE in its reports on housing, such as Better Housesand Delivering Great Places.\nSee Tessa Jowell's full speech here\nby Ed Dorrell\n}}

{{by NW Spotlight\nThe UK Telegraph is reporting that an upcoming one-day doctor strike (\u201cindustrial action\u201d) by the UK doctor\u2019s union, the British Medical Association, will cause a three month backlog and affect one million patients needing surgery or hospital appointments.\nThe British doctors\u2019 union is planning the strike over proposed changes to doctors\u2019 retirement pensions. The move by the British doctors\u2019 union has led to accusations of them being \u201cgreedy\u201d and leaving patients \u201cwaiting in pain\u201d for surgery.\nThe British Medical Association has also been accused of hypocrisy after staff working for the British Medical Association itself voted to strike in a dispute over pay.\nIn England\u2019s publicly funded healthcare system \u2013 the National Health Service (NHS) \u2013 the government is the single-payer and it owns healthcare resources (like hospitals) and employs personnel.\nSEIU-care: Although government-run healthcare in the U.S. would certainly be good for the SEIU \u2013 SEIU was a major player in pushing Obamacare \u2013 nationwide doctor strikes are yet another possible downside.\nSEIU is the largest healthcare union in the country, and is the fastest-growing union in North America.

{{WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Obama's approval rating for handling healthcare policy, now at 42%, has recovered from a downtick measured in January and February of this year -- before the healthcare bill became law.\nObama's approval ratings on healthcare policy were in the 40% to 44% range in surveys conducted in the second half of 2009 but fell to the upper 30% range earlier this year as the debate on healthcare reform intensified. The current uptick suggests that the president regained some positioning on the issue as a result of the healthcare bill's passage.\nObama's approval on handling healthcare policy has consistently been lower than his contemporaneous overall job ratings. His 42% rating on healthcare in the March 26-28 USA Today\/Gallup poll is slightly below the 47% overall job approval rating he received in the same poll, and below his average in Gallup Daily tracking for the same period of time.\nObama's current approval ratings on other dimensions range from a high of 48% for his handling of foreign affairs to a low of 31% for his handling of the federal budget deficit and the situation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nObama's ratings on handling foreign affairs, the economy, and the federal deficit are roughly in line with readings earlier this year, albeit down significantly from several points in 2009. For example, as recently as November of last year, Obama's approval on handling the economy was at 44%; today it is 37%. Obama began his administration back in February 2009 with a 59% approval rating on the economy.\nAs noted, the trend on Obama's handling of healthcare reflects a slightly different pattern. Although his January and February ratings on healthcare showed a modest decline from what was measured last summer and fall, his rating has rebounded to 42%, not significantly different from those readings. (Full trends on these approval measures are presented on page 2 of this report.)\nSurvey Methods\nResults are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,033 national adults, aged 18 and older, conducted March 26-28, 2010. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points.\nInterviews are conducted with respondents on land-line telephones (for respondents with a land-line telephone) and cellular phones (for respondents who are cell-phone only).\nIn addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.\n}}

{{Healthcare is quickly becoming about much more than the provision and reception of medical treatment. To a disturbing degree, healthcare public policy is becoming a means of imposing a secularist, anti\u2013sanctity-of-life ideology on all of society.\nConsider the following examples of this accelerating trend:\nErasing pharmacists' conscience rights in Washington: In 2007, Washington state\u2019s Board of Pharmacy\u2014at the prompting of the governor and Planned Parenthood\u2014promulgated a regulation requiring pharmacies to stock and dispense all FDA-approved medications. But because there are so many of these drugs, certain exceptions were made. For instance, a pharmacy may refuse to stock a drug due to low demand. In those cases, the refusing dispenser may refer patients to a pharmacy that does carry the prescribed drug.\nIf a pharmacy refuses to stock a drug for reasons of religion or of moral conscience, however, referral is not an option. Indeed, the governor was so intent on stomping on conscience rights that he threatened to fire and replace regulators when an initial version of the rule contained a conscience exemption.\nAfter the rule went into effect, one small pharmacy chain owned by Stormers Inc. continued to refuse to carry Plan B\u2014the \u201cmorning-after pill\u201d\u2014because of studies that indicate it might act as an abortifacient. The company\u2019s owners sued the state to be exempted from the regulation on grounds of the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause. (Washington does not have a Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2013type law like the one that protected Hobby Lobby from being forced to cover the morning-after pill in its employee health-insurance policies.)\nAt first, things looked good for the company. A trial concluded that the rule violated the religious liberty of Stormers (and similarly situated religious objectors) by requiring religiously opposed companies \u201cto choose between their First Amendment rights and their ability to provide for their families.\u201d But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, since the law applies equally and \u201cneutrally\u201d to all pharmacies\u2014to those whose owners object to dispensing the drug, and to those whose owners don't. Therefore, in Washington, if a pharmacy refuses to stock Plan B due to business considerations, it acts within the law, but if the same pharmacy refuses to stock the drug because of conscience concerns, it could face legal repercussions. (The Supreme Court recently refused to review the case.)\nACLU sues to force Catholic hospitals to violate Church teaching: Directive 45 of the \u201cEthical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services,\u201d published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, states explicitly that\n[a]bortion (that is, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted. Every procedure whose sole immediate effect is the termination of pregnancy before viability is an abortion, which, in its moral context, includes the interval between conception and implantation of the embryo.\nIn our anti\u2013sanctity of life era, it is no surprise that Catholic hospitals adhering to their Church\u2019s teachings on abortion are being targeted. A suit that sought to prevent Trinity Health Corporation from obeying the Ethical and Religious Directives was dismissed earlier this year; the dismissal was based on a procedural issue and prevented a principled ruling based on First Amendment rights.\nA similar case was recently filed in California after administrators of Mercy Medical Center, a Catholic hospital operated by Dignity Health, refused to permit a requested sterilization because of Catholic moral teaching that such a procedure is \u201cintrinsically immoral.\u201d Indicating the anti\u2013religious liberty bias in healthcare, the California Medical Association has joined the ACLU in trying to force the hospital to violate Church teaching.\nForcing pro-life crisis-pregnancy centers to provide abortion information: Many pro-life crisis-pregnancy centers provide women with information about pregnancy issues and non-termination options for an unwanted pregnancy. The state of California, in a major hit to free speech, recently passed a law requiring such pro-life centers to advertise where abortion information could be obtained. Specifically, the law requires that\n[a] licensed covered facility shall disseminate to clients on site the following notice in English and in the primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries as determined by the State Department of Health Care Services for the county in which the facility is located.\n(1) The notice shall state:\n\u201cCalifornia has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women. To determine whether you qualify, contact the county social services office at [insert the telephone number].\u201d\nNeedless to say, abortion clinics have no concomitant obligations to advertise where pro-life counseling can be accessed.\nThese few examples reflect a growing trend of opposition to pro-life and religious conscience rights in healthcare. Quebec\u2019s Minister of Health successfully ordered a palliative care center at the McGill University Hospital Medical Center to perform euthanasia. California now requires religious institutions to include elective abortion coverage in their health-insurance plans as a \u201cbasic health service.\u201d In Australia, physicians who object to abortion must procure an abortionist for a woman requesting a termination or they will face professional discipline. At least one doctor was so sanctioned when he refused to refer for a sex-selection abortion. The ACLU is suing to prevent Catholic hospitals that follow Church teaching from receiving federal funds. Most recently, in Vermont, Alliance Defending Freedom has filed a lawsuit to try to prevent state authorities from forcing doctors to counsel their terminally ill patients about assisted suicide (which is legal in the state) even if they consider it a profound moral wrong to participate in doctor-prescribed death.\nThis is the message being sent by the secularist attempt to stifle medical conscience: Sanctity of life has no place in healthcare. If you are pro-life, get out of medicine. If these legal and regulatory efforts succeed, only those who willingly cooperate with the culture of death will be welcomed in the medical field.\nWesley J. Smith is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute\u2019s Center on Human Exceptionalism.

{{The US economy added 156,000 jobs in December, with the biggest gains in the healthcare industry, which expanded by 43,000 jobs, according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data released Friday.\nNotably, manufacturing workers finally saw relief in December when that industry added 17,000 jobs. This was after months of declines amid a shrinking energy sector slammed by low oil prices, and amid a strong dollar that hurts US companies that export goods and services to countries with weakening currencies, such as Japan, China, and members of the European Union.\nAnother modest highlight for workers in December was a .4 percent bump in average hourly earnings from November. This reflected an increase of 10 cents to $26 an hour, according to the labor department report, and helped push average 2016 earnings up 2.9 percent, the biggest hike since June 2009.\nOther labor market indicators in December reflected upward trends that have been percolating throughout the year, all reflecting a solid economy to that will be handed over to Donald Trump by President Obama\u2019s administration. Mr. Obama took over the White House during the biggest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nThe unemployment rate last month also remained low, reaching near pre-recession levels, and way below a 10 percent peak during the height of the recession. Though December\u2019s rate rose to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent in November, the rise is a symptom of a positive trend, according to business analytics firm IHS Markit. The labor force grew by 184,000 last month, adding more people to the job statistics pool which can cause the unemployment rate to rise.\n\u201cAt this pace of growth, we can expect to continue to see improvements in the labor market over the next couple of years as we approach full employment,\u201d wrote Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank, in a newsletter Friday.\nThough economists expect the economy to grow modestly through next year, with wages expected to rise by 3 to 3.5 percent, some worry that many Americans who lost jobs during the Great Recession have not come back to work. The labor force participation rate, which tracks people over 16 years old who are working or looking for jobs, in December was 62.7 percent, down from 66.4 in December 2006, according to the labor department.\nSome of this decline can be attributed to retiring baby boomers, as Business Insider points out. But not all of it. Workforce participation among working-age Americans has been declining for decades, and has been especially low after the recession. In part this has to do with a shift in the labor market that makes it much harder to earn a living wage without post-secondary education. Some economists worry that among those who are not returning to the workforce are Americans who don\u2019t have the skills and training for the jobs that employers say they are struggling to fill, from machinists to health technicians.\nThis could help explain why the economy added fewer jobs in 2016 than in 2015, says IHS chief economist Nariman Behravesh: 2.2 million versus 2.7 million.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201cWe can hope that there are still some discouraged workers who might come back, though that pool is diminishing,\u201d Dr. Behravesh says.\nBut with the labor market having absorbed most available workers, businesses will become more eager to fill open slots, which should continue raise wages. Economists expect the unemployment rate to stay low, around 4.5 percent, in 2017.\n}}

{{When enrolling at a private school such as Georgetown, there are often \u201chidden costs\u201d that not all students and their families may be aware of. These costs have the most serious consequences for students from low-income backgrounds and are significant. At Georgetown, the forefront of these hidden costs is the student health insurance policy.\nBeginning in 2014, 28 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid eligibility to include households whose income was at least 138% of the federal poverty level. Figures vary according to state, it is currently 210% in D.C. This expansion finally made healthcare accessible to millions of Americans who were previously uninsured.\nI applied for and received my first health insurance policy through Medi-Cal, Medicaid of California, earlier this year. When I finally received my card from Anthem Blue Cross, it was the first day of my life that I knew if I fell and broke a bone, it wouldn\u2019t break the bank.\nThe fear that comes with living uninsured is a feeling known all too well for millions of Americans. For uninsured families, sickness means long waits at free clinics and the overarching fear of the financial strife, or even bankruptcy, that a medical condition could cause. We grow up knowing that the best thing to do when you are sick is to simply hope it passes without escalating. \u201cUnless you\u2019re dying, just wait it out,\u201d was a common phrase in my household growing up.\nBut all that is supposed to change in college. We have a student health center on campus, a program for student health insurance and a hospital. Certainly it is important when students are living in such close quarters to be able to access adequate health services, if at the very least to prevent the spread of potentially hazardous infectious disease. This is ostensibly why most colleges, including Georgetown, require all students to have full healthcare coverage before enrolling and living on campus.\nMany Georgetown students have a form of health insurance, either through a private provider or their parents\u2019 job, and are therefore able to waive the Premier Plan. However, for students who are either uninsured or beneficiaries of Medicaid, that is sadly not an option. The Office of Student Health Insurance capitulates the requirements that an existing policy must have in order to waive the Premier Plan \u2014 and no out-of-state Medicaid coverage is eligible. This begs an important question: If students who have other health coverage can opt out of it easily, for whom is the Premier Plan designed? It seems likely that it is targeted at low-income students who are otherwise uninsured and cannot afford its high price.\nWhen I received my first Georgetown bill in August, I was surprised to see the $2,375 health insurance fee, a fee that I had not been made aware of earlier during the financial aid process. I called the Office of Student Health Insurance and explained to them that I was receiving state benefits and could not pay for the student coverage. They informed me that my Medi-Cal was not adequate. When I asked if D.C. Medicaid would be accepted, I was told that no information about anything besides the Premier Plan could be provided. Another student was told that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t have come here if she couldn\u2019t afford the Premier Plan.\u201d\nAs previously mentioned, the expansion of Medicaid in D.C. allows all adults who make less than 210 percent of the federal poverty line to obtain free health care coverage (319 percent for children under the age of 18 and pregnant women, and 216 percent for parents). However, D.C. residency is required \u2014 something that a student living in California before Georgetown cannot possibly have. Even if D.C. Medicaid were to be accepted as a viable way to waive the egregious Premier Plan requirement, students wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain coverage until their second year.\nAdmittedly, the Georgetown endowment is comparatively small, so there is not as much money to devote to student needs, but not small enough that it cannot afford to give low-income students equal access to affordable health coverage. The administration should embody its own values of \u201cwomen and men for others\u201d and realize that the student health insurance policy is unjust. For Georgetown, University $2,375 might be negligible, but for many low-income students it poses a significant hardship that may prevent them from attending this university, accessing its resources and benefitting from the excellent opportunities that a Georgetown education undoubtedly provides.\nI propose that for the first year, Georgetown should waive the cost of the student health insurance plan for families who are beneficiaries of Medicaid or who are uninsured in states that have not expanded Medicaid but whose income falls within federal Medicaid guidelines. After that, the Premier Plan could be waived for D.C. Medicaid. Alternatively, scholarships and\/or grants should be available to cover this hidden cost that disproportionately affects low-income students. And last but not least Georgetown should offer counseling and information to its students on different health care options including applications for D.C. Medicaid.\nSerafina Smith is a junior in the College.\n}}

{{Austin's South-by-Southwest Conference (SXSW) is one of the world's largest innovative gatherings. Over 100,000 forward-thinking attendees from all walks of life came together last week to showcase their latest-and-greatest ideas and to share their visions of the future.\nI've covered SXSW for the past five years, and I always report on my key takeaways. I've noticed in recent years that healthcare is becoming one of the conference's fastest-growing and most popular tracks.\nFuturistic topics such as consumer genomics, population health management, and personalized medicine are inspiring a creative new era. High-profile healthcare heroes such as Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, 23andme co-founder Linda Avey, and Singularity University founder Ray Kurzweil pack auditoriums full of attendees eager to learn about where progressive technology and evolving payment methods are steering our system. The changing landscape will set the stage for several forward-looking Foolish recommendations to shine, such as Illumina's industry-leading genomic sequencers or athenahealth's interoperable electronic patient-health records.\nThis year, I got a chance to speak again with Dana Abramovitz, who's the business-development liaison of SXSW Interactive. In this role, Dana is responsible for planning, organizing, and managing the Health and MedTech sessions of SXSW -- so she gets an inside look at where the industry is heading. Dana also has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia University and a Master's in Management from Stanford's Graduate School of Business. She knows a thing or two about the technology and the business of healthcare!\nIn the video interview below, Dana shares the topics that were most popular this year, where the genomics industry is heading, and the impact of people taking greater control of their own health information.\nA full transcript follows the interview.\nSimon Erickson: I'm here with Dana Abramovicz, who's one of the lead programmers for SXSW Health Track this year. Dana, thanks so much for joining with us this afternoon.\nDana Abramovicz: Thank you for talking with me, Simon. It's always a pleasure.\nErickson: It's our pleasure, too. One of the things that you focus on is scheduling the sessions for the Health Track of SXSW. What did you want to accomplish in the programming for the Health Track this year?\nAbramovicz: To me, health touches everyone, so whether you're in the medical industry as a provider or an insurer, or just a patient or a caregiver, it touches everybody. Because SXSW attracts people from all across the world and across different industries, I wanted everybody to at least spend five minutes thinking about their health. I really tried to get programming that touched upon that -- that these things are important to everybody.\nErickson: I know we have hundreds of thousands of people descending on Austin this year. It's always completely crazy. What are some of the sessions that you think people are really interested in and that people have been attending this year?\nAbramovicz: We've had a lot of interest in things that were more personal. Personal stories. Things people are touching through technology or in person [with] each other. A session on loneliness and how that affects our health, and ways that we can disconnect a little bit from technology to improve our health. Or exercising with friends. Just more of a personal interest.\nI wanted to focus a little bit more on being proactive and how we, as a society, can make improvements. There were two sessions on the social determinants of health -- that how you live and what you have access to can impact your health. How bias may impact your health. How your doctor treats you [can impact your health]. You have these unconscious biases [that create an] impact you probably don't even know about.\nAnother one would be trauma during childhood and experiencing [such] things. You may not even realize the impact to a child. It can impact physical health, as well as [mental health]. And just the importance of recognizing that, both as patients and [as providers] in the medical industry.\nErickson: It sounds like a lot of behavioral health.\nAbramovicz: Yes. Actually, we have a session coming up this afternoon on inspiring men to take charge of their mental health. I hear mental health being discussed in the news all the time, but men aren't [actively] participating in that healthcare discussion. That can really impact so much in public health.\nErickson: A very important topic. And technology is great, but sometimes it's good to put the cellphone down and unplug a little bit.\nAbramovicz: Absolutely.\nErickson: One of the other things you and I have chatted about before, Dana, is genomics, which is becoming more and more popular. There's more and more headlines about the genome. Where do we stand in genomics, in general? Where is this industry versus where it was a couple of years ago?\nAbramovicz: This is what's so exciting to me. SXSW always tries to program [in such a way that] we're forward thinking and just steps away from the future. I love that we've seen the growth of genomics in that conversation over the past few years. This year, we have five different sessions [where we're] talking about genes and genomes. I'm hoping to get to a point [where just] like the internet was first being introduced at SXSW in 1993...\nErickson: That's a long time ago.\nAbramovicz: A long time ago. And now we can't even function without having access to it. We don't even think about having to turn it on. Getting to the point where [when you're born] you have your genome sequence. It's now part of your health record. It's now part of the things that you do. And all we can do with that information. How it can be not [only] for prevention, but [impact] the foods that we eat, and nutrition, and understanding all of that.\n[I was] talking with one of the speakers from the last session. [What happens once] you get your genome sequence at birth? Does epigenetics play in? We haven't even gotten into that conversation, but hopefully that will be coming down the road at SXSW.\nErickson: So just like the internet when it was first starting, a lot of people were kind of afraid of it. They didn't know about the privacy of the internet, but over time, they got more comfortable and it just enabled so many things. Are you seeing the same things with genomics today? People are still maybe a little scared of sharing their DNA, but with time, that's going to become more comfortable?\nAbramovicz: Absolutely. It was interesting in that one session. The moderator asked the audience how many people had had their genome sequenced? And about one-third of the audience raised their hands. So we are getting to [that] point [of] consumer-based genomics. FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of genomic testing. Being able to get certain drugs based on genetic markers. The first drug to get FDA approval.\nRather than [getting approval] based on disease type (like cancer), actually being approved based on the genomics is just so exciting, because we're getting to the root. We're looking at things at the micro level to know what's happening. We now have so much more data. We know so much more. We don't know everything, yet, but that's part of the fun.\nErickson: Data driven for more objective and less subjective decisions.\nAbramovicz: Yes. And inspiring people to figure out what's going on and taking ownership of their healthcare. That [gets] back to inspiring everyone who comes to SXSW to think about their health.\nWe had a session where a man was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer and his prognosis was terrible. But he took his health into his own hands. He got his tumor sequenced. He identified clinical trials. He is alive because he took ownership of his health and used genomic sequencing to identify what was going on and find the treatment to treat [what was going on] at the micro level. How do we get patients and doctors working on the same page? We've had sessions about that.\nEvery time I talk to somebody about anything in healthcare, we have a session on that, so it's really exciting for me to be able to hopefully have such a positive impact on so many people.\nErickson: And we're seeing more success stories every year.\nAbramovicz: Yes. The Health Track at SXSW has been growing year over year, which is wonderful. It creates much more work for me, but it is my pleasure to be a part of that.\nErickson: Well, thanks so much for spending the time with us, also, this afternoon.\nAbramovicz: Thank you.\n[End]\n}}

{{Dr Theophilus Owusu-Ansah, Eastern Regional Director of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), has said avoidable deaths by pregnant women due to hermorrage were enough basis to justify the use of drones in delivering blood in emergencies.\nHe said the argument that Ghana was not ready for drone\u2019s delivery in the healthcare system was unfortunate and that whiles it is critical for government to invest in health infrastructure especially in the rural areas, it is equally good that in the meantime a fastest way of delivering essential commodities such as blood and medicines are explored.\nDr Owusu Ansah said the call for enough ambulances is a genuine concern and a step in the right direction \u201cbut that did not negate the fact that drones services are not important, considering the nature of our road networks we can\u2019t compare the speed of a drone to an ambulance\u201d.\nThe NHIA Director made the submission at the Eastern Regional Health Dialogue on the theme \u201cEnsuring Sustainable and Equitable Access to Quality Health Services: Prospects and Challenges\u201d organized by the Star Ghana Foundation in collaboration with the African Rights Initiative International and the Doctors in the Gap Project in Koforidua.\nHe said ambulances are critical components in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to quality healthcare services, but given the circumstances that our road networks are bad and ambulances have to travel long distances to save lives, the drones would play very critical roles as a stop gap whiles government builds the road infrastructure and networks.\nDr Owusu-Ansah cited for instance Afram Plains and many other island communities whose movement were determined by the availability of the pontoon and wondered the difference that an ambulance would make in times of emergencies as compared to the drone.\nDr Kwame Amin Boamah, Medical Director of the Eastern Regional Hospital, said due to poor road networks and scattered nature of our communities, accessibility to timely and quality healthcare was a challenge and therefore anything that would leverage on the speed for the time being is a good initiative.\nHe said many women died of hemorrhage due to lack of blood and some essential medicines and so if blood and some critical medicines could be delivered within \u201cthe calculated space then why not\u201d adding that government must also map up strategies in addressing the human resource base in addition to all other interventions.\nHowever some participants made up of members of the media, civil society organizations, the academia and experts in the healthcare were of the view that government should rather invest in getting every community or health facility an ambulance rather than the huge investment in the drone service.\nSome of them argued that the drone service was a secondary matter and what the country needed now was putting in place a well-equipped health infrastructure in the rural communities to ensure equitable and timely access to health care services.\nSource: GNA\n}}

But insurance is rarely free.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve shifted the healthcare costs and the pension costs on to employees, so employees are making less and they\u2019re spending less,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million members. \u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy.\u201d\nConservative legislatures\u2019 push to shift health and pension costs on to individual teachers means in some states, teachers take home less pay than they did five years ago.\nThe most high-profile example is West Virginia, where teachers earned a 5% raise after a nine-day wildcat strike. Before that, they earned less take-home pay than in 2012 because of soaring health costs.\nOver the last decade, private insurance companies have increasingly demanded more \u201ccost-sharing\u201d from patients, a euphemism for more money out of people\u2019s pockets. This week teachers in Oklahoma became the latest to take industrial action.\nIn 10 years, out-of-pocket costs have increased dramatically for all Americans. From 2005 to 2015, the average amount of money people have to pay themselves before insurance cover kicks in grew from $303 to $1,505. Once insurance starts paying, people are liable for another cost, called \u201ccoinsurance\u201d. That grew from $134 to $253, on average. Overall, cost-sharing rose 66% in 10 years, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.\nIn the last decade, workers\u2019 contract negotiations have orbited around health costs. What will an employer pay? Can the employee take on more?\n\u201cThey are center stage in every contract negotiation,\u201d said Weingarten. \u201cI don\u2019t know a contract negotiation where they haven\u2019t been center stage.\u201d\nSo extreme is the situation that a group of billionaires have set out \u201cdisrupt\u201d health insurance because it would help their bottom line. Among them was investor Warren Buffett, who called health costs a \u201ca hungry tapeworm on the American economy\u201d.\nIncreasing health costs are not unique to teachers \u2013 Americans across the labor spectrum have paid more out-of-pocket for healthcare. However, conservative policies have inadvertently made them the most visible victims.\nIn states such as Arizona, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin, conservative legislatures pushed for all teacher pay raises to go through the statehouse. Now, with mounting labor actions, it\u2019s those same statehouses that face pitched battles to improve teacher benefits.\n\u201cThe right wing thought if this would happen we would be less politically engaged,\u201d said Weingarten. \u201cBut this requires you to be more politically engaged.\u201d\nIn Jersey City, New Jersey, teachers cited the burden of health costs when they went on strike in mid-March. It was the first strike in 20 years.\n\u201cWe want nothing more than to get back to work under a contract that respects the expertise of our members and the need for affordable healthcare,\u201d said the teacher union president, Ronald Greco, according to NJ.com. Teachers are required to pay between 3% and 35% of their pay to health insurance, thanks to a recent state law.\nA student enters the Academy I middle school in Jersey City, New Jersey, as teachers strike on 16 March. Photograph: Julio Cortez\/AP\nIn Oklahoma, where teachers have the lowest average teacher pay of any state, a walkout started Monday. The state pays for health insurance for employees. Benefits for their families cost extra, but that care is constantly under threat.\n\u201cThe state will start complaining that the cost of healthcare keeps rising and it\u2019s becoming burdensome,\u201d said Ed Allen, the president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers chapter. \u201cThey will do comparisons with other states and say their salaries are much higher, but they don\u2019t pay as much on the healthcare.\u201d\n}}

{{Story Highlights 58% favor replacing the ACA with federally funded healthcare system\nAbout half would also be OK with keeping the ACA as is\nSeparate question shows that just over half would favor repealing the ACA\nPRINCETON, N.J. -- Presented with three separate scenarios for the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), 58% of U.S. adults favor the idea of replacing the law with a federally funded healthcare system that provides insurance for all Americans. At the same time, Americans are split on the idea of maintaining the ACA as it is, with 48% in favor and 49% opposed. The slight majority, 51%, favor repealing the act.\nFavor or Oppose Three Proposals Relating to the Affordable Care Act Please tell me whether you strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose each of the following. Favor % Oppose % No opinion % Replacing the ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans 58 37 5 Repealing the Affordable Care Act 51 45 3 Keeping the Affordable Care Act in place 48 49 2 Gallup, May 6-8, 2016\nGallup included these three questions in its interviewing on May 6-8 to provide insight into how Americans might react to the three remaining presidential candidates' proposals for dealing with the ACA. Bernie Sanders calls for replacing the ACA with a single-payer, federally administered system that he calls \"Medicare for All.\" Donald Trump has said he would repeal the ACA, and Hillary Clinton generally says she would keep the ACA in place. Americans were asked in the survey to react to each of these proposals separately, and there was no mention of the candidates in the question wording.\nThe results show that many Americans are OK with several ways of handling the ACA rather than favoring only one possibility. In particular, 35% of all Americans say they would favor keeping the ACA in place and separately say they favor the idea of replacing it with a federally funded universal health insurance system. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 59% favor both of these approaches. In short, many Americans would apparently go along with Clinton's idea of keeping the ACA in place as it is now, or with Sanders' bolder proposal to replace it with a Medicare-for-All system.\nGallup also asked those who favor either keeping the ACA in place or replacing it with a federally funded system to choose between these two options. The federally funded system wins among this group by a 2-to-1 ratio, 64% to 32%, meaning this system garners the most support among the initial favor\/oppose questions and wins when those who like both approaches are forced to choose.\nAdditionally, 27% of Americans say they favor repealing the ACA and say they favor replacing it with a federally funded system. This means the group of Americans in this survey who favor the law's repeal, a core policy proposal of many Republican presidential candidates during this campaign season, includes some who apparently want the ACA repealed to replace it with an even more liberal system. Only 22% of Americans say they want the ACA repealed and do not favor replacing it with a federally funded system.\nDemocrats Favor Keeping the ACA and Replacing It With Single-Payer System\nThe breakdown of reactions to these proposals by partisanship shows the expected patterns: Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are highly likely to favor the two options put forth by the Democratic candidates, while Republicans and Republican leaners are highly likely to favor Trump's position, repeal of the ACA.\nProposals to Deal With Affordable Care Act, by Partisanship Democrats\/Leaners % Republicans\/Leaners % Replacing the ACA with a federally funded healthcare program\nproviding insurance for all Americans Favor 73 41 Oppose 22 55 Repealing the Affordable Care Act Favor 25 80 Oppose 72 17 Keeping the Affordable Care Act in place Favor 79 16 Oppose 19 82 Gallup, May 6-8, 2016\nOne notable exception to the strong partisan skew in reactions to these proposals comes from Republicans when they are asked about replacing the ACA with a federally funded system. Forty-one percent of Republicans favor the proposal -- much higher than the 16% who favor keeping the ACA in place. This may reflect either that Republicans genuinely think a single-payer system would be good for the country, or that they view any proposal to replace the ACA (\"Obamacare\") as better than keeping it in place.\nApproval of the ACA and What Should Be Done About It\nResponses to other questions included in the May 6-8 survey show that Americans remain split in their overall views of the ACA, with about as many approving as disapproving of the law. Almost nine in 10 of those who approve of the ACA in general subsequently say they would favor keeping it in place, which is logical. But 72% of those who approve of the ACA also would favor replacing it with a single-payer federally funded health system. This reinforces the idea that ACA supporters can agree simultaneously with several different ways of dealing with this law.\nBottom Line\nAmericans express considerable support for the idea of replacing the ACA with a federally run national healthcare system, which is similar to the proposal championed by presidential candidate Sanders. To be sure, many Americans, primarily Democrats, also favor the idea of just keeping the ACA in place. But given a choice, those who favor both proposals come down on the side of the Sanders-type proposal. Four in 10 Republicans also favor the idea of a federally funded system.\nAdditionally, Americans have been more positive than negative in two previous Gallup measures of the idea of a single-payer federally funded system, although when given a chance to say so, a sizable percentage of Americans say they don't know enough about it to have an opinion.\nThe current survey used shorthand descriptions to describe the alternatives for dealing with the ACA, and it's possible that not everyone understands the implications of each approach. Instituting a universal healthcare system, in particular, would be one of the most significant overhauls of a major part of American life in modern U.S. history, and would create huge consequences and challenges. Additionally, other research shows that when given a choice, Americans are philosophically more inclined to favor a private healthcare system than one run by the government. Americans are generally satisfied with their personal healthcare, something that also could slow down the process of adopting a major overhaul of the healthcare system. Still, the general idea of a single payer system seems to play well with the majority of Americans, something both the presumed Democratic nominee Clinton and the Republican nominee Trump will need to keep in mind as they debate healthcare in the months to come.\nHistorical data are available in Gallup Analytics.\nSurvey Methods\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted May 6-8, 2016, on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey, with a random sample of 1,549 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

I have the template to ensure the right allocation of funds to education agencies in Bende LGA and vigorously pursue the implementation of the education budget heads\u2019\n\u2018Promotion of the vocation of farming as a viable means of livelihood shall be a key objective, especially for the youth and women.

{{\u201cIt\u2019s constitutional. Bitches.\u201d \u2014Patrick Gaspard, Executive Director, DNC\nObamacare lives. And, with it, Barack Obama\u2019s case for a second term.\nIn laying the groundwork for 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney have had dueling imperatives: The president needs to make sure that the November election is a choice. Romney needs to make it an up-or-down referendum.\nIn Team Obama\u2019s frame, choosing to reelect the president is a vote to continue moving \u201cForward\u201d; choosing Romney is a vote to return to the policies that created our current pain.\nThat frame only works, however, if you can demonstrate that you\u2019re, in fact, creating forward progress that\u2019s easing the pain. And June has been a hazardous month for that narrative. The nation\u2019s slow, steady economic recovery appeared to stall out. Job growth flatlined. Then Obama gaffed, calling the private sector\u2019s stagnating performance \u201cfine.\u201d\nThe June gloom played right into Team Romney\u2019s frame: \u201cObama isn\u2019t working.\u201d The president hasn\u2019t delivered. You need to vote him out of office (by, oh yeah, voting for me.) The upshot of this referendum model is that you don\u2019t even have to like Romney, just so long as you want to oust Obama.\nNow, imagine for a moment that the president\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment had gone down the tubes this morning, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the dissenters in finding the Affordable Care Act \u201cinvalid in its entirety.\u201c\nThe Romney camp could have rightly blasted Obama for two years of wasted effort.\nAn economy treading water. An historic legacy invalidated. Nothing about that says \u201cForward.\u201d It would have said \u201cFail.\u201d Yes, Obama has bin Laden\u2019s scalp, but even Jimmy Carter had Camp David.\nThe death of Obamacare would have underscored the Romney frame: It\u2019s time to kick this guy out of office. (Don\u2019t look too closely at me.)\nBut that\u2019s not what happened: Chief Justice Roberts, with a keen eye toward the legacy of the Roberts Court, broke boldly from his Federalist Society frat brothers and tailored a narrow decision that allowed Obamacare to stand \u2014 on a technicality: The individual mandate to buy health care is constitutional when considered strictly as a matter of taxation, not regulated commerce.\nObama\u2019s historic legislative legacy is now secured. He cleared, by the narrowest of margins, a high bar for universal health care set by generations of Democrats.\nAnd his reelection frame has been strengthened immeasurably.\nThe president can now run on the popular forward progress already brought by Obamacare: Millions of young adults insured on their parents\u2019 plans; millions of seniors benefitting from reduced prescription drug costs; the end of lifetime caps on insurance coverage.\nHe can also campaign on the progress yet to come, starting with the millions who will be receiving a rebate check this summer from their insurers for excessive administrative costs, as well as the \u201cBig Fucking Deal\u201d provisions that would kick in during Obama\u2019s second term: An end to insurance denials based on preexisting conditions; new health care markets for individual purchasers; and generous premium supports for those buying policies.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Romney campaign is now enthusiastically reinforcing the president\u2019s Forward\/Backward narrative by jumping on the #FullRepeal bandwagon, promising to undo Obamacare.\nInstead of talking about the economy and how he\u2019s got the right experience to get the private sector moving, it\u2019s now Romney who will be wasting time trying to refight the battles of 2009, seeking to reverse course on a health care law that\u2019s modelled on his own (highly successful) reforms in Massachusetts.\nRomney\u2019s hopes of turning 2012 into a referendum on Obama\u2019s failed presidency have been dashed. Today\u2019s Supreme Court decision may not have quite enshrined Obama in the club of Democratic lions FDR and LBJ. But with Obamacare cemented, BHO has certainly put the specter of Jimmy Carter in the rearview mirror.\nWhatever economic struggles face the nation come November, voters will now have a choice to make:\nStick with the most accomplished Democrat in two generations; or back the Republican whose idea of progress is updating the economics of George W. Bush.\n}}

{{Despite a looming strike next week, there was no last minute deal struck today in the last bargaining session between the Motion Picture and Television Fund and the union that represents the healthcare workers at the Wasserman Camus in Woodland Hills and other facilities. \u201cAfter extensive good faith bargaining on MPTF\u2019s part, we have reached an impasse. No further negotiating sessions have been planned,\u201d said MPTF CEO Bob Beitcher in a statement Wednesday. Union officials insist they are still willing to meet in good faith with the MPTF before the three-day strike scheduled to start Monday night. However, with no deal on a new three-year contract and no one scheduled to talk further, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West says it does intend to follow through on the formal strike notice it gave the MPTF last week and hit the picket line starting late on March 18. Further action could follow, a source confirmed to me. Part of that action could stem from the MPTF\u2019s intention to bring in replacement workers during the strike. \u201cWe have completed the polling of our employees and have lined up qualified temporary staffing for a five-day period starting Monday night for those employees who have elected to walk out. Patient and resident safety is and will always be our primary concern and we are confident that our extensive strike preparation will ensure that, said Beither today. \u201cAn organization like ours relies heavily on federal and state healthcare reimbursements, and these are shrinking by the moment. We need to size our costs to fit our anticipated revenues and in so doing we are asking all of our staff to join in a shared sacrifice. SEIU-UHW has insisted on its own framework for settlement. We believe its proposal is inconsistent with our ability to serve our patients and residents as well as our ability to provide job stability now and in the future,\u201d he added.\nRelated: Union Pickets MPTF Hospital\nThe SEIU-UHW represents around 500 nurses, their aides, medical-records workers and other caregivers at the MPTF\u2019s Wasserman Camus hospital and other venues. The union and management have been in talks about a new contract since August 2012. Members at the MPTF\u2019s care facility and hospital overwhelming voted to authorize strike action on January 30. Picketing and leafleting action followed on February 21 and outside Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s 11th Annual \u201cNight Before\u201d Oscars Fundraiser for the MPTF on February 23 at the Beverly Hills Hotel. After the last bargaining session between the SEIU, the MPTF and a federal mediator on March 8 ended with no progress the union gave management a formal 10 day labor action notification. The SEIU-UHW says wages, low staffing levels, raised health care premiums and frozen retirement contributions are the main issues on the table. CEO Beitcher told employees on January 31 that staffing levels were not part of the bargaining.\n}}

{{United Healthcare and Florida Hospital, which owns Florida Hospital Flagler, have been negotiating a contract since November. They\u2019re at a deadlock. The contract expires on Aug. 15. Florida Hospital has decided that it will no longer honor United Healthcare rates after that date, and United Healthcare has decided that it won\u2019t cover its patients according to in-network rates should they decide to go to Florida Hospital facilities, unless it\u2019s for emergency treatment. In that case, in-network rates apply regardless.\nFor half a million Central Florida patients, including thousands in Flagler County (and thousands of children on Medicaid who are covered through United Healthcare), that means going to any one of Florida Hospital\u2019s 17 major facilities and many more clinics will not be an option anymore, unless the patients are willing to pay the far larger cost of going to an out-of-network health care provider.\nThe Flagler County school district, the county\u2019s largest employer, just signed a contract with United Healthcare that covers most of the district\u2019s 1,800 employees and their families. That contract kicks in Sept. 1. They\u2019re luckier: United Healthcare has told the district that even if the contract runs out on Aug. 15, United Healthcare claims at Florida Hospital Flagler and its clinics will be honored indefinitely, at in-network rates. But United Healthcare may give the district a 90-day notice at any point, beyond which in-network rates would no longer be honored.\nThat makes the district nervous. The school board and a United Healthcare official will discussed the matter publicly this afternoon in a meeting, but the discussion was inconclusive beyond the district\u2019s agreement to stay with United Healthcare for now and re-visit the issue at its next meeting, pending further discussions with United on attempts to extend the assured window of coverage.\nOther people covered by United Healthcare, and restricted by income, geography or circumstances to getting their care at Florida Hospital Flagler, may not be as lucky, though United Healthcare is pledging to extend in-network rates for at least 75 days after Aug. 15 (should negotiations fail) to all Flagler residents who have United Healthcare coverage.\nThe Dispute in Context\nThe dispute sums up for Flagler County an emerging conflict that hospitals and insurers are inflaming across the country. Health care providers and insurers are lining up to maximize their profits under the new health care reform law. That law extracts higher payments from hospitals and limits how much insurers can gouge their clients in premiums or arbitrarily dump them from coverage.\nTo make up what they fear they\u2019ll lose, hospitals are raising rates, and insurers are pushing to lower or minimize the reimbursements they pay, and to increase the decision-making of insurer adjusters when a patient wants a procedure done, among other tactics. The contradictory forces are playing out in negotiations between hospitals and insurers\u2014at patients\u2019 expense.\nThat, in essence, is at the root of the conflict between Florida Hospital and United Healthcare, two giants of their respective industry who are also gigantically profitable, even though Florida Hospital is ostensibly a non-profit company. For all their claims to fairness, \u201cparity\u201d and competitiveness, neither United Healthcare nor Florida Hospital are anywhere near difficult financial straits. To the contrary. Despite the recession, both companies have thrived, recording record profits.\nProtecting Record Profits\nUnited Healthgroup, which is United Healthcare\u2019s parent, told shareholders two weeks ago that it expects current-year revenue to reach $93 billion. Its second-quarter profits of $1.12 billion was a 31 percent increase over a year ago despite the recession. United\u2019s health-benefits division such as United Healthcare added 700,000 clients in three months after accounting for a loss of 400,000 clients due to jobless people losing their benefits. Flush with cash, United increased dividend payments to shareholders to 13 percent of the company\u2019s cash\u2014an enormous proportion by any measure. UnitedHealth Group is shouting to shareholders: look how rich we are.\nFlorida Hospital is ostensibly a non-profit organization run by Adventist Health Systems. Some companies are more non-profit than others. Adventist and Florida Hospital are not among them. They\u2019re non-profit in name only. Florida Hospital\u2019s network of 17 hospitals in the state is part Adventist\u2019s 38 hospitals in the nation. Every year since 1999, Adventist has averaged year-over-year profit gains of 29 percent, including 55.5 percent in 2009, when it earned $363 million in profits. In 2007, Florida Hospital CEO Lars Houmann\u2014who\u2019s featured affably talking about the unfairness of United Healthcare\u2019s demands in a three-minute spin video\u2014was paid $1.1 million. Adventist CEO Don Jernigan earned $3.5 million in 2007. (Read an analysis of Houmann\u2019s video here.)\nFlorida Hospital makes much of its charity payments. But the company\u2014like all non-profit hospitals\u2014significantly inflates its charity through accounting tricks. For example, when an uninsured patient gets a $10,000 procedure, the hospital eats that cost. But a $10,000 appendectomy may actually cost $5,000 for an insured patient, because that\u2019s the rate negotiated with insurance companies. The hospital doesn\u2019t list that rate as its charity cost, but the full $10,000, literally doubling the actual cost to its bottom line. So while Florida Hospital talks a good game of wanting \u201cparity\u201d in the cost structure insurers pay for given procedures, the hospital doesn\u2019t apply the same parity to its own accounting procedures.\nThe company\u2019s website claims that it is \u201ca not-for-profit healthcare organization that emphasizes Christ at the center of care.\u201d Emphasizing the health security of half a million patients, at the moment, appears to be in a differenc circle of care.\nThe Disputed Contract\nFlorida Hospital says it hasn\u2019t renegotiated the contract with United Healthcare since 2001. Now United Healthcare wants to keep its rates lower than what other private insurers are paying the hospital. \u201cIf we were to accept the original rate increase proposed by Florida Hospital, it would mean employers and their employees would be paying 63% more for their services at Florida Hospital by 2014 compared to what they pay today,\u201d says Tracey Lempner, a United Healthcare spokeswoman. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our enrollees and employers in central Florida to provide access to health care at affordable rates, and we could not agree to increases that would raise their expenses so sharply.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about what the number is. They\u2019re the ones who have thrown the number out there,\u201d Florida Hospital spokeswoman Sam Olenick said. But Olenick didn\u2019t dispute the figure, either, saying it only shows how far United Healthcare is lagging behind other insurers in terms of what it ought to be paying. For example, an MRI might cost $700 more in three years than it does now, for a United Healthcare patient.\n\u201cThe parity issue with United is that all of their competitors are at a certain point with Florida hospital on our contracts,\u201d Lars Houmann, the Florida Hospital CEO, says in a video on Florida Hospital\u2019s website, \u201cand we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at with all of them, and United has a distinct head start because they\u2019re, what they\u2019re paying for services from Florida Hospital, it is not where those others are, and we don\u2019t think they should have that unfair advantage in the market.\u201d\nBut there is no parity between what private insurers pay for procedures and what Medicare pays, which is typically lower. Florida Hospital isn\u2019t about to jeopardize the coverage of Medicare patients over that (and run afoul of federal regulations or lose one of its most lucrative source of income: elderly patients).\nLempner said \u201cUnitedHealthcare fully supports a single fee schedule across all plan designs to simplify the contract and make it easier for both parties to process claims.\u201d\nAnother point of contention is United Healthcare\u2019s emerging demand from hospitals that the insurance company be notified within 24 hours whenever a patient wants services. The reason the insurer wants that leverage is because it increases the insurer\u2019s ability to deny coverage upfront and limit exposure to payments down the line.

Fewer Americans than a year ago cite the high cost of living or unemployment, and the percentage naming oil or gas prices is down from 2012.\nGallup has been asking Americans about the most important financial problem facing their family in an open-ended format for the past 10 years. Healthcare this year has returned to the top of the list for the first time since early 2010, when the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare,\" was signed into law. Still, Americans viewed it as an even bigger financial problem in 2007, when a range of 16% to 19% said it was most important.\nNotably, 6% of Americans see the high cost of living or inflation as their family's biggest financial problem, down from 13% just over three years ago. And in today's era of sub-$50-per-barrel oil, only 2% name energy costs, or oil or gas prices as their most important financial problem, down significantly from 11% in 2012 amid a spike in oil prices.\nThe percentage who don't mention any financial problem is up five percentage points from last year, to 17%. This sizable uptick suggests that the economic recovery may be reducing the financial problems that families face.\nMost Important Financial Problems Vary Across Income Groups\nFor Americans earning $75,000 or more a year, retirement savings, college expenses and healthcare costs rank as the most important financial problems. Among lower-income Americans, retirement savings and college expenses are less important. Healthcare costs, however, have double-digit-percentage support across the board.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, lower-income Americans name \"lack of money\/cash flow\" and \"not enough money to pay debts\" as their top most important money woes. The stock market or investments, interest rates, retirement savings and controlling spending do not rank among lower-income Americans' top financial problems.\nBottom Line\nThe American economy continues to recover. With Gallup's Economic Confidence Index in positive territory for the first time since the Great Recession, and with President Barack Obama stating that the U.S. last year had its best year for job growth since 1999, certain financial problems have receded from the nation's memory, while others have persisted in the forefront. Americans have consistently cited healthcare, a topic of fierce debate this decade, as one of the most important financial problems, and it remains so.\nLack of money and low wages are still an important problem for many Americans, yet unemployment and the high cost of living are mentioned less often than in recent years, as are energy prices. Whether these developments result from a stronger economy or are just not top of mind, Americans' financial worries clearly have shifted over the past few years.\nIssues that have remained low-level concerns all decade -- including Social Security, the stock market, controlling spending and transportation costs -- remain low again this year, suggesting that, good times or bad, Americans are not concerned about these issues affecting their families' financial situation.\nSurvey Methods\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 5-8, 2015, on the Gallup Poll Social Series, with a random sample of 804 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.\nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50% cellphone respondents and 50% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.\nLearn more about how Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n}}

{{If you could travel back in time just one week, it would be a smart move to buy a few stocks during your visit to the recent past. Three healthcare stocks skyrocketed 35% or more over the last five days: Reata Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RETA), resTORbio (NASDAQ:TORC), and LifePoint Health (NASDAQ:LPNT).\nUnfortunately, time travel isn't possible right now. Investors are stuck with trying to predict what might happen with stocks in the future. Are any of the week's biggest healthcare winners still great stocks to buy now? Here's what you need to know about Reata, resTORbio, and LifePoint Health.\n1. Reata Pharmaceuticals: Two for two in phase 2\nReata Pharmaceuticals ranked as the top healthcare stock of the week with shares soaring 67%. All it took for the huge gain was a little good news from phase 2 clinical studies. On Monday, Reata announced positive results from two phase 2 studies evaluating bardoxolone methyl (bardoxolone) in treating patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nOne of those studies focused on patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. In this study, patients receiving bardoxolone experienced significant improvements in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure for kidney function, after one year of treatment.\nThe other results announced by Reata this week related to a cohort of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in another phase 2 study. Reata observed a statistically significant improvement in eGFR for these patients also.\nInvestors were understandably excited about these study results, especially since the Food and Drug Administration had told Reata previously that a statistically significant improvement in eGFR after one year could potentially support accelerated approval of bardoxolone. The company is enrolling a phase 3 clinical study targeting Alport syndrome, with results expected in the second half of 2019. If all goes well after one year of treatment, Reata could be on track to win its first drug approval.\n2. resTORbio: Breathing easier\nResTORbio wasn't too far behind Reata. The biotech stock jumped 61% this week thanks to its own encouraging phase 2 clinical study results. On Wednesday, resTORbio announced positive data for its lead candidate, RTB101, in treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in elderly patients.\nJust how good were those results? There was a 30.6% reduction in the number of patients with RTIs for patients who received a 10-milligram dose of RTB101 compared to patients on a placebo. Even better, certain subsets of patients in the study achieved even greater improvements. For example, there was a 68.4% reduction in RTIs for asthma patients age 65 and up, as well as a 66.7% reduction overall in patients with RTIs age 85 and older.\nRTIs in elderly patients is a serious healthcare worry in the U.S. It's the No. 7 leading cause of death for elderly Americans and the No. 4 cause of hospitalizations. RTIs result from infections by many different viruses, with no FDA-approved drugs for treating many of them.\nThese positive phase 2 results were a major relief for resTORbio shareholders. RTB101 is the company's only pipeline candidate.\n3. LifePoint Health: A private victory\nLifePoint Health's share price rose 35% this week after the healthcare facility operator's announcement that it was merging with RCCH HealthCare Partners, which is owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. As you might expect with this deal, if it goes through, LifePoint Health will be taken private.\nThe resulting entity will be known as LifePoint Health, with current LifePoint CEO William F. Carpenter III still at the helm. The combination of LifePoint and RCCH will create a company with more than $8 billion in annual revenue. Its facilities will include 84 community hospitals across 30 states, plus regional health systems, physician practices, outpatient clinics, and post-acute care facilities.\nIt's not a done deal just yet, though. LifePoint Health can still look for other potential acquirers until Aug. 22. If a better opportunity comes along, the merger with RCCH could be off.\nThe LifePoint Health transaction is one of several recent cases where private equity firms have bought healthcare companies to take them private. In June, KKR & Co. announced its acquisition of physician staffing provider Envision Healthcare, and Veritas Capital announced that it was buying healthcare technology services provider Cotiviti Holdings.\nAre they buys?\nReata Pharmaceuticals' phase 2 results looked great. However, it's important to remember that these were really small studies -- one study involved only 30 patients, and the other 31 patients. Investors would be better off waiting to see how Reata's promising CKD drug fares in a larger clinical trial.\nI'm cautiously optimistic about resTORbio's prospects as it advances RTB101 to late-stage testing. Again, though, it's still too early to know how successful the drug will be. In addition, I suspect that resTORbio will use its share price boost to raise more cash via a stock offering -- a move that Reata has already taken.\nAs for Lifepoint Health, I don't think the company will get a better deal than what Apollo has put on the table. The stock has probably jumped about as much as it's going to.\nThese three stocks were definitely hot this week. But for investors hoping to catch some of that heat, my view is that they'll need to look elsewhere.\n}}

{{Mary Meeker\u2019s latest Internet Trends Report, out today, was full of insights on how tech is shaping our future \u2014 including now in healthcare. This was the first year Meeker included healthcare in her report and it shows just how much of a role tech is going to play in improving our lives going forward.\nA few key insights from the report:\nWearable devices have continued to gain momentum with 25 percent of Americans now owning one (up 12 percent from 2016). The most popular of these are devices tracking our speed, followed by heart rate.\nMore of us are now downloading health apps and willing to share our health data, too.\nMeeker\u2019s report says a full 60 percent of us were willing to share our health data with Google in 2016.\nConsumers also have more access to commercially available lab tests than ever before.\nIn other good news, hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices now offer patients access to their own digital data, as well.\nAll that data has now helped medical knowledge double every 3.5 years (as opposed to doubling every 50 years like it did in 1950).\nLarger amounts of available health data is possibly helping to accelerate clinical trials and encouraging collaboration within the scientific community, too.\nMuch of these insights aren\u2019t all that surprising. Wearables are ubiquitous, there\u2019s money to be made in disrupting old systems by making them digital and venture firms have poured a bunch of money into new health startups to do just that. According to Rock Health, financing in the space rose to $4.2 billion in 2016 and VCs are now reportedly \u201ctripping over themselves\u201d to hire more experts in the bio field.\nThere are a few drawbacks, of course. Healthcare is a highly regulated area and, unlike an app, you can\u2019t just spit something out and tweak later. As Theranos sadly learned, you have to be right about your product the first time. But it\u2019s pretty neat to see the health field get in-depth coverage from Meeker this year. It shows the power Silicon Valley holds in shaping the way we handle our future well-being.\n}}

{{PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday promised extra money and more doctors in rural areas to ease pressure on France\u2019s hospitals, which are creaking under the weight of budget constraints and closures of clinics outside towns and cities.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on the transformation of the French healthcare system at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, September 18, 2018. Etienne Laurent\/Pool via REUTERS\nMacron\u2019s announcement came days after he unveiled a separate 8 billion euro plan to help some 8.8 million people who live below the poverty threshold.\nMacron hopes his social reforms will help counter criticism from left wingers that he is a president of the rich and help turnaround a sharp fall in popularity.\nSpending on healthcare will increase by 2.5 percent in 2019, higher than the initial 2.3 percent target and amounting to an additional 400 million euros ($470 million) in a near 200 billion euro budget, Macron said.\n\u201cWithout changes, the hospital system will collapse,\u201d Macron said in a speech at the Elysee Palace. \u201cWe need to rethink how we organize healthcare for the next 50 years.\u201d\nFrance\u2019s public healthcare system is considered one of the world\u2019s best, but an ageing population and financial constraints have put it under strain.\nPatients increasingly complain of overcrowded emergency rooms and, in rural areas, travel times to the nearest clinic, while nurses frequently bemoan a shortage of beds and staff.\nMacron promised the recruitment of 4,000 medical assistants to handle paperwork and free-up doctors in urban areas to treat patients. Some 400 doctors will be deployed to rural zones where coverage is thin. No hospitals would be closed, he said.\nSome non-critical emergencies will be diverted to local practices to alleviate pressure on hospital emergency rooms, he added.\nMacron said that in time he wanted to overhaul the convoluted financing of hospitals.\nSince 2004, hospitals have paid for their costs from the income they receive from the state for treatments. The state regulates how much it will pay public hospitals for each intervention.\nPressure to keep public spending down over the past decade has, however, led some hospitals to carry out unnecessary procedures to generate sufficient revenues to cover their costs.\n\u201cThis has gotten crazy. Everything in our system encourages it and we lose sight on quality of care,\u201d Macron said.\nSamuel Bottaro, a healthcare specialist with private consultancy firm Mazars, said he was encouraged by the proposals but cautioned a number were short on detail.\nFunds for the digital modernization of France\u2019s healthcare system will also be available from a 4.9 billion euro envelope set aside for \u201csocial cohesion\u201d investments during the 2018-2022 period, the government has previously said.\n}}

{{OUT of hours GP services have come under \"chronic stress\" in Scotland, according to an official review which has recommended a major shake-up of the system.\nThe probe into the way patients are looked after in the community when GP surgeries are shut, found services are \"fragile\" and warned the situation will \"worsen\" without immediate action to attract doctors to careers in general practice.\nHowever, it also said in future patients would not automatically see a doctor when they had pressing health problems during evenings and weekends - instead proposing mixed teams of nurses, pharmacists, therapists and social care staff based in \"urgent care hubs\".\nEven fire fighters, with training in resuscitation techniques, could have a bigger role to play in some areas.\nThe report also said the public and professionals were confused about how to use out of hours (OOH) systems, and suggested a high profile information campaign. It stresses OOH services are for \"urgent\" health problems - rather than issues which can wait until morning - through-out.\nThe review, chaired by Professor Sir Lewis Ritchie, was ordered by the Scottish Government amid concern health boards were finding it increasingly difficult to find enough GPs to cover OOH shifts.\nFamily doctors were able to give up responsibility for providing medical cover during evenings and weekends under a new contract which was introduced in 2004 and Sir Lewis' report says: \"This has resulted in a number of unforeseen and adverse consequences - including insufficient participation of GPs in OOH services.\"\nThe report notes younger doctors who started work after the contract came in are the least likely to help man OOH clinics and warns about the impact on staffing levels as the older generation retire.\nIncreasing exposure to OOH work during training, providing mentors for those who are new to the service and making OOH jobs more attractive are among the remedies suggested.\nDr Sian Tucker, co-chair of the National Operations Group which represents OOH staff, said: \"We are delighted that this review has launched because we wanted it to evaluate the challenges out of hours were facing and the feeling we were an invisible service. People did not know we existed.\"\nThe report, commissioned earlier this year, acknowledges this, saying: \"Specific lack of recognition of these services within (health) boards results in a \u2018Cinderella\u2019 service with underinvestment and chronic stress in the system.\"\nInvolving the internal NHS watchdog Healthcare Improvement Scotland in monitoring standards for OOH care are among the measures suggested to address this.\nThe report also recommends creating specialist palliative care support specifically for patients at the end of their lives so they do not go through the same NHS 24 phone system as everyone else if they need medical advice. It calls for falls services, which exist in a number of areas to look after the frail if they fall without being injured, to become standard.\nBetter sharing of patient records is also discussed.\nSir Lewis said while his remit was to look at OOH care, the model of GPs leading a team of mixed professionals in urgent care centres matched the vision for daytime GP surgeries.\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison said \u00a31m had been made available immediately to fast-track test sites for the urgent care hubs. She said: \u201cWe are already taking a comprehensive range of actions across all areas of our health service in order to meet the changing demands and the recommendations in Sir Lewis\u2019 Review will build on this, helping ensure a more effective and sustainable service for the future.\"\nA plan on implementing the proposals will be published in the spring.\nThe review was released on the same day as research showing GPs in Scotlands most deprived communities receive \u00a310 less per patient than those in more affluent areas. Ms Robison has said she is \"sympathetic\" to the need to address this funding issue.\nThe key points from the OOH Review are:\n* In future OOH care will be delivered by a GP-lead team including nurses, other health professionals, paramedics, social services and voluntary agencies in urgent care hubs.\n* A national workforce plan to prepare for this should be rapidly drawn up.\n* GPs should spend more time in OOH during training and be encouraged to work in the service\n* OOH staff should have rapid access to specialist paediatric doctors and paediatric medicine should be part of their training.\nMeanwhile, a \"potential agreement\" has been reached between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Government which could lead to strike action being suspended, the Health Secretary has said.\nJeremy Hunt told MPs in the Commons there had been a \"time-limited\" agreement for further talks, where the BMA would suspend strike action if the Government agrees not to impose a new contract on doctors.\n}}

{{The best argument for a single-payer health plan is the recent decision by giant health insurer Aetna to bail out next year from 11 of the 15 states where it sells Obamacare plans.Aetna\u2019s decision follows similar moves by UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, and by Humana, another one of the giants.\nAll claim they\u2019re not making enough money because too many people with serious health problems are using the Obamacare exchanges, and not enough healthy people are signing up.\nThe problem isn\u2019t Obamacare per se. It lies in the structure of private markets for health insurance \u2013 which creates powerful incentives to avoid sick people and attract healthy ones. Obamacare is just making this structural problem more obvious.\nIn a nutshell, the more sick people and the fewer healthy people a private for-profit insurer attracts, the less competitive that insurer becomes relative to other insurers that don\u2019t attract as high a percentage of the sick but a higher percentage of the healthy.\nEventually, insurers that take in too many sick and too few healthy people are driven out of business.\nIf insurers had no idea who\u2019d be sick and who\u2019d be healthy when they sign up for insurance (and keep them insured at the same price even after they become sick), this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But they do know \u2013 and they\u2019re developing more and more sophisticated ways of finding out.\nHealth insurers spend lots of time, effort, and money trying to attract people who have high odds of staying healthy (the young and the fit) while doing whatever they can to fend off those who have high odds of getting sick (the older, infirm, and the unfit).\nAs a result we end up with the most bizarre health-insurance system imaginable: One ever better designed to avoid sick people.\nIf this weren\u2019t enough to convince rational people to do what most other advanced nations have done \u2013 create a single-payer system that insures everyone, funded by taxpayers \u2013 consider that America\u2019s giant health insurers are now busily consolidating into ever-larger behemoths.\nUnitedHealth is already humongous.\nAetna, meanwhile, is trying to buy Humana in a deal that will create the second-largest health insurer in the nation, with 33 million members. The Justice Department has so far blocked the deal.\nInsurers say they\u2019re consolidating in order to reap economies of scale. But there\u2019s little evidence that large size generates cost savings.\nIn reality, they\u2019re becoming huge to get more bargaining leverage over everyone they do business with \u2013 hospitals, doctors, employers, the government, and consumers. That way they make even bigger profits.\nBut these bigger profits come at the expense of hospitals, doctors, employers, the government, and, ultimately, taxpayers and consumers.\nThere\u2019s abundant evidence, for example, that when health insurers merge, premiums rise. researchers found, for example, that after Aetna merged with Prudential HealthCare in 1999, premiums rose 7 percent higher than had the merger not occurred.\nWhat to do? In the short term, Obamacare can be patched up by enlarging government subsidies for purchasing insurance, and ensuring that healthy Americans buy insurance, as the law requires.\nBut these are band aids. The real choice in the future is either a hugely expensive for-profit oligopoly with the market power to charge high prices even to healthy people and stop insuring sick people.\nOr else a government-run single payer system \u2013 such as is in place in almost every other advanced economy \u2013 dedicated to lower premiums and better care for everyone.\n}}

{{December is an expensive month for anyone, and tech companies across Africa went on a fundraising spree in advance of the festive period last month.\nCompanies from across the continent, in a variety of sectors, raised funding in December. Most notable was pan-African e-commerce company Jumia, which raised strategic investment from the alcoholic beverage brand Pernod Ricard.\nAnother major fundraiser was infrastructure firm Liquid Telecom, which secured a $180 million USD cash injection from CDC Group, while Nigerian travel company Wakanow raised $40 million USD. South African fintech company JUMO took its total raised funds to over $103 million USD after Odey Asset Management invested $12.5 million USD in the company.\nDecember also saw an acquisition in the tech space, in Tunisia, with retailer Magasin G\u00e9n\u00e9ral buying e-commerce startup Founa. It was a busy month for the North African country, which also saw fintech startup Expensya raise $4.5 million in investment and Utopixar secure grant funds from UNICEF. Egyptian startups Halan and Vezeeta also bagged cash.\nThe long list of tech startups that secured investment also included Nigeria\u2019s Kobo360, Kenya\u2019s UTU, Ghana\u2019s AgroCenta, and Zambia\u2019s Rent to Own. South African startups HouseME, Snapt and Naked Insurance also raised.\nSeparatists go crypto\nMeanwhile, in Cameroon, separatists in anglophone areas, who are rebelling against the francophone government, have created their own cryptocurrency, AmbaCoin, as they look for an easier way of moving money around.\nTech is being used in a slightly more developmental way in Ghana, where the government has partnered with drone operator Zipline to launch emergency health and blood delivery services. Ghanaians will also soon be able to access their National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) policy via mobile thanks to new government policy.\nAnother government taking positive steps is Rwanda, which will roll out free Wi-Fi on public transport next year. In Kenya, however, the authorities are busying themselves with filtering access to adult content websites in order to \u201ccurb teenage pregnancies.\u201d\nThe usual global tech giants were active over the course of the month, with Google launching Google Station in the Nigerian capital Abuja. Google Station is a platform for the provision of free Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, and its deployment in Abuja follows its launch in Lagos in July.\nUber and Careem do battle in Egypt\nAnother major firm that had a busy month was Uber, which launched a bus-hailing service in Egypt, where it will go head to head with the Dubai-based Careem, which has done exactly the same thing.\nUber has also launched 24-hour helplines for drivers and riders in Kenya and South Africa, but will have to contend with the new Nairobi County Finance Bill in Kenya, which will see ride-hailing companies pay an annual licensing fee.\nAnd that was December in Africa.

Without a budget bill, programs in operation today will be funded with \"continuing resolutions,\" a stopgap measure.\nFor the Iowa-Nebraska Primary Care Association , it puts growth on \"hold.\" Base funding is \"solid and secure,\" according to Ted Boesen, Executive Director for the Iowa-Nebraska Primary Care Association, but new \"access points\" are an issue for which funding is not so clear.\nWhile existing centers are likely to remain open, Boesen says the problem is the need for more. There are communities with applications in for new community healthcare center \"access points\" in Burlington, Dubuque, and northwest Iowa\u2026but without a final federal budget that contains an increase for them, there won\u2019t be funding for the communities that want a new center to open.\nCommunity Health Centers are outpatient clinics that provide primary medical care, dental care, and mental or behavioral-health care to anyone who comes to ask for care, regardless of their ability to pay. They\u2019re charged on a sliding fee scale. Boesen says while the centers only offer outpatient care, they help many people with their preventive health care, like vaccinations, diabetes monitoring, and prenatal care for pregnant women.\n\"We\u2019re an essential part of the safety-net fabric,\" he says. People who don\u2019t have any other options have a place they can go, and the programs help keep them well, and avoid the costly and inappropriate trips they might otherwise make to hospital emergency rooms. He says many can avoid being admitted to hospitals if they get the proper care from the community centers, which fill the role of a family physician. There are ten community healthcare centers in Nebraska, and more than 30 in Iowa funded by the association.\n}}

{{Opponents more likely than supporters to base their 2010 vote on the issue\nPRINCETON, NJ -- The American people are no less divided on healthcare reform today than they were a month ago. A new Gallup Poll finds 39% of Americans saying they would direct their member of Congress to vote against a healthcare reform bill this fall while 37% want their member to vote in favor.\nOne in four Americans (24%) say they have no opinion about which way their representative should vote on a healthcare reform bill, down only slightly from early August.\nThe new Gallup Poll, conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 2, suggests the issue could be politically potent in 2010. Sixty-four percent of Americans say their representative's position on healthcare reform will be a major factor in their vote in the next congressional election; just over a third say it will be no more than a minor factor.\nOpponents of reform have the edge in intensity here. Among Americans who want their member of Congress to vote against healthcare reform, 82% say the issue will be a major factor in their vote in next year's elections. Among those wanting their member to vote for reform, 62% say the issue will be a major factor for them.\nDemographic Breaks on Support for Healthcare Reform\nPublic attitudes about how members of Congress should vote on healthcare reform are highly partisan. Two-thirds of Democrats (68%) want their representative to support a healthcare reform bill while a comparably sized majority of Republicans (72%) want their member to vote against it. Independents lean against healthcare reform, 44% vs. 29%, although their opposition does not rise to the level of a majority (28% of independents offer no opinion).\nApart from Democrats, support for healthcare reform is highest among women, lower-income Americans, those with postgraduate education, and residents of the East.\nLooking at support by gender and age, women under 50 are particularly supportive (47% in favor of passage vs. 27% against), whereas women 50 and older are about evenly split.\nA slight majority of upper-income Americans want their representative to vote against healthcare reform. Middle-income Americans are divided on the question while lower-income Americans are more supportive than opposed.\nYoung and middle-aged Americans are closely divided in their views, while adults 55 and older lean against reform. These generational findings are consistent with other Gallup polling in recent months finding seniors to be the most hesitant of all age groups about healthcare reform.\nBottom Line\nA month of town-hall meetings across the country during Congress' August recess has hardly budged Americans' views about passing a healthcare reform bill, or helped many more Americans form an opinion. The public is as divided over healthcare reform today as at the beginning of August (37% in favor and 39% opposed), with a large segment still undecided.\nAlthough the two sides on healthcare reform are about evenly matched numerically, opponents may have a political edge. The 82% of reform opponents saying the issue will be a major factor in their vote for Congress next year eclipses the 62% of reform advocates who say the same.\nSurvey Methods\nResults are based on telephone interviews with 1,026 national adults, aged 18 and older, conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 2, 2009. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points.\nInterviews are conducted with respondents on land-line telephones (for respondents with a land-line telephone) and cellular phones (for respondents who are cell-phone only).\nIn addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys\n}}

{{Photo by AFP\nIn this perception survey, carried out by the Herald with financial and technical support from the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), Islamabad, we asked the respondents to rate the health service provision by various administrations during the last five years. They were also asked to identify five key issues related to the provision of health services. We additionally asked them what they thought of the expenditure made on healthcare by various governments and how they managed their personal health-related expenses.\nThe responses reflected how well (or badly) different provinces manage the health sector. We then calculated the average of all the responses to form a national baseline of public perceptions about the health service provision. This showed that 44 per cent respondents saw health service provision as average \u2013 neither good, nor bad. Another 23 per cent were of the view that the provision of health services is above average or excellent and 32 per cent rated the provision of health service as below average or very poor.\nLikewise, a national baseline (average of responses from all the four provinces) on key issues related to health service delivery was also prepared. These issues include lack of availability of public health services at the union council and community level (highlighted by 59 per cent respondents), difficulty to access health facilities due to distance\/time (flagged by 53 per cent respondents), lack of availability of medicines\/supplies (recorded as a key issue by 47 per cent respondents), lack of facilities for the patients (pointed out by 46 per cent respondents), lack of secondary and tertiary level health facilities (underscored by 40 per cent respondents) and corruption\/misuse of resources (indicated by 39 per cent respondents).\nPunjab\nA sizeable number of respondents (42 per cent) rated the health service provision in Punjab as average. This is just a little short of the national baseline. Another 30 per cent respondents, much higher than the national baseline, termed the provision of health services in the province above average or excellent whereas 27 per cent (significantly lower than the national baseline) rated Punjab\u2019s health service provision as below average or very poor. In other words, compared to the national baseline, Punjab is doing better.\nA majority of the respondents (59 per cent) thought that the provincial government\u2019s expenditure on health services is not sufficient whereas 32 per cent perceived the government\u2019s spending in this sector as sufficient. When it comes to the five key issues, lack of availability of public health services at the union council and community level was pointed out by 62 per cent respondents; lack of facilities for patients (waiting area, toilet, etc) by 46 per cent respondents; lack of availability of medicines\/supplies at public health facilities by 45 per cent respondents; difficulty in access to the facilities in terms of time\/distance by 42 per cent respondents and lack of secondary and tertiary level facilities by 41 per cent respondents.\nIt is important to note that 37 per cent respondents ranked corruption and misuse of resources, 35 per cent respondents flagged behaviour of staff at health facilities and 34 per cent respondents pointed to the non-availability of doctors as the key issues in the province. Another 30 per cent respondents highlighted the non-availability of lady doctor as an important issue.\nThese responses endorse that the focus of the Punjab government is on infrastructure development or brick and mortar projects (communication and transport and electricity) and that too in major cities. This is why a large number of respondents have complained about the lack of public health facilities at local level. Complaints about corruption, behaviour of staff and non-availability of doctors also seem to contradict the general perception of Punjab as a \u2018better managed province\u2019.\nThe perception of exclusion and marginalisation among the residents of peripheral and remote districts only suggests that there is a difference between a \u2018shining Punjab\u2019 and a \u2018suffering Punjab\u2019. The recent defectors from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PMLN) have cited this \u201cexclusion and marginalisation\u201d of their constituencies as a major factor behind their decision. This may not be entirely true in each case yet the \u2018suffering Punjab\u2019 needs to be taken care of by the next government if it wants to turn the province into a model of governance.\nSindh\nThe percentage of the respondents who termed the health service provision in Sindh as average and those who termed it below average or poor does not differ much: 48 per cent of them termed health service provision in the province as average (this is in line with the national baseline); another 44 per cent (much higher than the national baseline of 32 per cent), however, termed it below average and or very poor. Another major (negative) departure from the national baseline is seen in the case of \u201cabove average and excellent\u201d; only 7 per cent respondents from Sindh (compared to the national average of 23 per cent) rated health service provision in the province as above average or excellent.\nSimilarly 76 per cent respondents felt that the government expenditure on health is not sufficient; only 7 per cent termed it sufficient. The key health-related issues identified by the respondents were: lack of availability of public health services at the union council and community level (by 68 per cent respondents); difficulty in access to the facility in terms of distance\/time (by 53 per cent respondents); access to health facilities due to road and transport problems and lack of availability of medicines\/supplies at public health facilities (each by 51 per cent respondents); lack of facilities of patients (by 49 per cent respondents) and corruption and misuse of resources (by 47 per cent respondents).\nClose to 40 per cent respondents complained about the behaviour of staff at health facilities, a similar number complained about the lack of secondary and tertiary level facilities and 34 per cent complained about the lack of availability of doctors at public health facilities. Like Punjab, one also sees a clear difference between the health service provision in major cities and interior Sindh. The major difference perhaps is that in the case of Punjab one can identify many major cities with reasonable public sector health facilities while in the case of Sindh it is difficult to name a third major city (in the context of public health service delivery) after Karachi and Hyderabad. While one observes a \u2018shining\u2019 Punjab and a \u2018suffering Punjab\u2019, in the case of Sindh, one observes a \u2018suffering Sindh\u2019 and a \u2018slightly less suffering Sindh\u2019.\nBalochistan\nIf our respondents offer a perfect sampling of the national public opinion, then the health service provision during the last five years has remained least satisfactory in Balochistan. Only 17 per cent respondents termed it as average; 7 per cent termed it as above average or excellent and 76 per cent viewed it as below average or very poor. That 91 per cent respondents deem the government spending on health sector as insufficient is only another indication of this large scale dissatisfaction.\nUnlike Punjab and Sindh, where lack of availability of public health services at the union council and community level is seen as the most pressing health related issue, in Balochistan it is the third key issue, highlighted by 62 per cent respondents. The most important issue identified by our respondents in Balochistan is the lack of availability of doctors at public health facilities, highlighted by 73 per cent respondents.\nThen come the lack of availability of medicines\/supplies (highlighted by 64 per cent respondents), lack of availability of lady doctors (highlighted by 53 per cent respondents), lack of secondary and tertiary facilities (highlighted by 44 per cent respondents), corruption and misuse of resources (highlighted by 43 per cent respondents), lack of facilities for patients (highlighted by 39 per cent respondents) and problems in access to health facilities (highlighted by 31 per cent respondents).\nThese results endorse a general perception of the failure of governance in Balochistan which has led to increased insecurities among the residents of the province. My hypothesis is that when an individual insecurity interacts with a collective identity crisis, be it is ethnic, sectarian, provincial or any other, it leads to a clash between \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots\u201d. The perception of exclusion, marginalisation and deprivation in Balochistan is rooted in the insecurities created by the failure of governance and will continue to threaten development initiatives such as Gwadar Port and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The next government (both at the federal as well as the provincial level) will have to take care of these insecurities, not only to improve the social indicators of Balochistan but also to keep its social and political fabric intact.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa\nThe public perception about the healthcare provision in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is way better than the national average. A majority of our respondents (54 per cent) termed provision of health service in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as average; 26 per cent termed it above average or excellent (three per cent above national average) and 18 per cent termed it below average or very poor. The last category, which shows the level of dissatisfaction with health services, is almost half of the national average \u2013 and way lower than in Punjab and other provinces.\nDespite this rather positive public opinion, 57 per cent respondents were of the view that the provincial government needs to spend more on health services and 33 per cent deemed the current level of spending as sufficient. On both counts, the province has performed marginally better than Punjab.\nOur respondents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also show significant departure from the countrywide baseline numbers in at least two key issues concerning healthcare: corruption and misuse of resources is identified as a key issue by 24 per cent of them, compared to 38 per cent nationally. Similarly, lack of availability of medicine\/supplies is highlighted by 41 per cent respondents in the province whereas the national average is 47 per cent. On most other issues, negative approval rating is less than that of every other province, including Punjab that gets a slightly better rating on the access to secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. The two provinces are also tied on the access to healthcare facilities in terms of time and distance.\nConclusion\nWhen it comes to the provincial governments\u2019 performance in the health service provision during the last five years, one can see a visible change in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the level of satisfaction with public health services is higher than in other areas. Punjab government has, on the other hand, focused on infrastructure and energy-related projects which has led to a situation where major cities of the province are in a better condition (including in terms of health service) but the remote and peripheral districts are still suffering, thus creating two provinces in one \u2013 a \u2018shining\u2019 one and a \u2018suffering\u2019 one.\nIn Sindh, the level of dissatisfaction with health-related services is quite high. With very small percentage of those who rate health service delivery as above average or excellent, we can see that half of Sindh is \u2018suffering\u2019 and the rest is \u2018slightly less suffering\u2019 when it comes to public health facilities. Balochistan, on the contrary, is presenting an entirely gloomy picture. Cost of inaction there will erode our national, societal and social fabric which no one can afford. Next governments, both at the federal and the provincial level, will have to impose a health emergency in Balochistan. Otherwise it will be too late to rectify the situation.\nSurvey Coordination: Momina Manzoor Khan and Namrah Zafar Moti\nData Compilation: Aliyah Sahqani, Sarah Dara, Namrah Zafar Moti, Momina Manzoor Khan\nThe writer is the executive director of SDPI\nThis is the second part of our end-of-term public opinion poll.

{{The healthcare plans of Amazon.com are slowly beginning to come into focus. No surprises, the Seattle ecommerce giant plans to upend everything, again.\nCompany engineers are working on software capable of reading digitized patient records and clinical notes, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 27.\nIt could be a major new business for Amazon.\nThe market for storing and analyzing health information is worth $7 billion, according to the Journal. Amazon Web Services is the leading provider of cloud computing services to businesses. Data storage is in its wheelhouse. The bigger story for Amazon is software.\nThe new code would beat current efforts in natural language processing by also recognizing hand written notes from clinicians. To date, misspellings, abbreviations and other jargon have tripped up algorithms. AWS engineers used extensive deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to clear this hurdle.\nIf true, it would be a significant leg up on competitors IBM (IBM) and United Healthcare (UNH) , the two leading players in the processing of digital records.\nAmazon has been coy about its healthcare plans. Jeff Bezos, its wily chief executive officer, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, and Jamie Dimon, chieftain at J.P. Morgan, announced in January that the firms would work together to tackle healthcare costs. The idea was to use their combined scale and technology to deliver high-quality employee healthcare at a reasonable cost.\nSeven months later, Amazon acquired for $1 billion PillPack, a business that presorts medications, then ships them directly to customers' homes in 49 states.\nAt the time, industry watchers assumed the online giant was readying entry in the $400 billion pharmacy business. Given the latest software developments, prescriptions look like a piece of Amazon's larger healthcare ambitions.\nBeyond interest payments on the national debt, healthcare costs are the fastest growing part of federal spending. The U.S. government spends a staggering $3.2 trillion annually on healthcare. There is a lot of waste in the system, and sadly, there has been little incentive to alter course.\nFortunately, the sector is undergoing a digital transformation. The same process that turned vinyl records into bits of data is spreading throughout healthcare as medical records come online. If history is any indication, better outcomes for end users, and much lower costs are coming.\nAmazon is not the only new player.\nAlphabet (GOOGL) has a dedicated life sciences business. Its subsidiary, Verily, is working to bring data analytics to drug discovery. The division reached 500 staffers in 2017, and has projects in the works with Sanofi, Glaxo Smith Klein, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) .\nIts most ambitious project is Baseline, a four-year study to determine why people get sick. The company will track 10,000 participants through every aspect of their lives, on a continuous basis. Engineers even developed a wearable device filled with sensors. The goal is simple: Collect a lot of data, use machine learning to make sense of it, then put the insights to work to create better outcomes for patients.\nIt is the same thinking behind a new drug discovery platform being developed by Accenture (ACN) . Most investors would not normally associate a global consulting firm with drug discovery, but it is part of an emerging trend. Information technology is intersecting with medical technology in profound new ways. The common ground is data and digital transformation.\nFor its part, Amazon has been working with hometown Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research center, one of the leading research facilities in the country. Since April, some 60 technicians and researchers have been employed at the Seattle center to help Amazon algorithms learn to extract select data from the records of 500,000 anonymized cancer patients.\nEventually, AWS software should be able to automatically identify eligible patients for experimental cancer drugs simply by scanning medical records. While this may seem like a lot of work for an incremental outcome, the key is automation, and ultimately scale.\nThose two factors will go a long way toward reducing the escalating cost of healthcare. Technology firms do automation and scale really well. Better outcomes for governments and end users is on the way.\nTo learn more about my recommendations at the crossroads of health care and technology, check out my daily newsletter Strategic Advantage.\n}}

{{Of the many industries that have successfully implemented and benefitted from the use of AI, provided by machine learning algorithms, there is one, in particular, that is looking to unceasingly leverage the limitless capabilities of the AI revolution, i.e. Healthcare Sector.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is used by many people in their daily lives, knowingly or unknowingly, services like voice command tools, navigation services like maps are some common uses of AI. These examples by now would have given many of you an idea of the power of AI and the numerous possibilities it presents for impacting varied business sectors. In most general terms, Artificial Intelligence can be described as the assimilation of human intelligence in machines.\nLooking at how AI is now going mainstream, it is no surprise that this tech innovation was one of the major highlights of the Interim Budget 2019, with the announcement of the government\u2019s plan to launch a national program on AI by starting the National Centre for AI and further development of the National AI portal. This encouraging development will now open many avenues and areas for this technology to showcase its advantages and offerings for sectors across the board.\nOf the many industries that have successfully implemented and benefitted from the use of AI, provided by machine learning algorithms, there is one, in particular, that is looking to unceasingly leverage the limitless capabilities of the AI revolution, i.e. Healthcare Sector.\nAI has an immense potential to transform each vertical of the ever growing healthcare sector. Telemedicine or Telehealth is one such emerging field in the healthcare which is steadily gaining traction. The synergy between AI and telemedicine can bring forward a long term solution to address the problem of accessibility, cost, and quality. The sector has already started using AI in understanding and analysing medical data to facilitate better consumer experience by automating many of its processes. Furthermore, AI can help in improving the telemedicine services by using machine learning algorithm to better diagnose ailments, give better insights and help prognosis in patients\u2019 way ahead and prescribe medications & treatments accordingly. Also, with Indian\u2019s government\u2019s initiative and promotion of digital technology, this sector with the support of telemedicine can reach out to remote areas to provide better healthcare to one and all.\nIn a country like India where there is a huge disparity in the distribution of healthcare facilities and where there is an unfavourable doctor-patient ratio, which is further compounded by the rich-poor and urban-rural divide, an efficient tandem of telemedicine and AI will play a critical role. The 2030 vision of 1 lakh digital villages could further transform the way healthcare will be accessed and delivered. The steady adaptability can act as a mediator in resolving the issue and making healthcare reachable and affordable to all.\nWorldwide valued at USD 38,046 million in 2018 and expected to grow at USD 103,897.77 million in 2024, according to a market intelligence firm, the growth drivers of the teleconsultation market are the need for cost-effective healthcare solutions, technological advancements and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases.\nSome other areas of healthcare are already expertly leveraging the power of AI. To start with, many are using bots for customer service. These bots, like any medical assistant, have the capability of doing all the basic and mundane tasks of registering patient information, booking an appointment with doctors or labs and even managing test results while providing impeccable service. It also provides secure customer support from the first step, wherein the patient interacts with an AI application through a chatbot on a website or an app. In fact, the popularity of chatbots gave way to voice bots, which is the next level of the bot era, wherein, after analysing various recordings, an algorithm is formed that has the capability of answering the basic questions pertaining to routine health issues and suggesting its cure on call. This also lessens the long call-waiting time for customers and is intelligent enough to transfer the call to a doctor, when it does not have a solution. This can help offer 24\/7 assistance for basic requests, improve customer service and productivity of the sector.\nAnother important aspect where AI can be used in the healthcare segment is for the treatment of chronic diseases. With every fifth person in India suffering from such a condition, according to a 2018 study, keeping a hawk\u2019s eye on early detection and fitting in regular monitoring is crucial. Thus, AI can help in successfully diagnosing diseases, and can also facilitate regular contact between these patients and healthcare providers. The digitization of this process can assist in continuous monitoring of the patients\u2019 status and administering the medication in patients.\nAlso, prediction of epidemics is another integral area where AI can support public welfare. In case of communicable diseases, with the help of AI, certain patterns like the weather condition, wind speed, proximity to water bodies, pollution, or earlier outbreaks, can be observed by the machine to give intelligent insights that can further help in clinical decision making.\nWith prospects galore, the use of AI can lead to incredible results that will bring a paradigm shift in the way doctors treat patients. The collection of data will give the healthcare industry the power to insights that can result in early detection, better care, and thus, improve patient longevity to a certain extent. However, this means, in a long time to come is only a step towards helping real doctors and nurses deliver better and not replace their services and personal touch, which is one of the most central areas of healthcare.\nBy Ashish Gupta- CEO, Docprime.com.\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the original author.

{{Central West nurses involved in mental healthcare services have welcomed NSW Labor\u2019s promise to introduce nursing ratios into 37 adult acute inpatient mental health units across the state. Orange-based president of the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association Mid-Western (NSWNMA) Mental Health Branch, Angela Walton, says it's fantastic news and with more staff they can provide the best care to patients. \"They [patients] come to us when they are most vulnerable,\" Ms Walton said. \"With the current staffing we are not able to provide the care that they [patients] require.

Ms Walton said the introduction of nurse-to-patient ratios will help with the recruitment and retention of nurses. \"Mental health is a specialty in its own right,\" Ms Walton said. \"The ratios will hopefully encourage nurses to look at mental health, which they have not considered as a career beforehand, and it will reduce the burden on staff who are currently working in the profession. \"Extra nurses will ensure a safer and more stable environment which will make for a happier work environment, which in turn produces better health outcomes for the patients.\" Read more: Lithgow will not have the same winter by 2050: New climate report NSWNMA general secretary Brett Holmes asked the Liberal-Nationals coalition to follow Labor's suit. \u201cFor too long our mental health nurses have had to struggle with ongoing understaffing, excessive workloads and poor skill mix issues,\" Mr Holmes said. \u201cMental health nurses are burning out under the pressure and they are already in short supply.\" Mr Holmes said Labor\u2019s pledge will deliver nurse-to-patient ratios of 1:4 on morning and afternoon shifts, and 1:7 on night shifts, as well as an in-charge nurse across all shifts.\nhttps:\/\/nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net\/transform\/v1\/crop\/frm\/WZXauW9i8bTNuviVjjuS7d\/075e4ed4-813c-44c4-833f-bb6881fbb768.jpg\/r0_494_1137_1136_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n}}

{{From all the reading I\u2019ve been doing on healthcare lately it has dawned on me that medicine should not be a business. Education, which is vital to a strong democracy, is not treated as a business (except for those \u201cvoucher\u201d people), and healthcare is even more vital. A couple of months ago I was wondering if health insurance was really good for us and tried to discover how much those companies made in net profits\u2013wondering if it would be enough to finance \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d as opposed to \u201chealth insurance.\u201d Ad Policy Dr. Marc regularly answers readers' questions on matters relating to medicine, healthcare and politics. To send a query, click here\nAfter searching the Internet for two days I discovered that the companies who were publicly traded made gobs of money, but without the profits of all the other health insurance companies which aren\u2019t publicly traded, I really couldn\u2019t reach an informed conclusion.\nToday I found a couple of reports that made my eyes cross. Consumers Union and Families USA have put together some shocking numbers. Since you are concerned about Medicare, you may want to read these reports. One telling statistic that I came across showed that the per-case cost of administering healthcare by the government was in the neighborhood of 15 cents, compared with $1.25 for the same work done by health insurance companies. The reports I\u2019m sending you links for tells why. The other concern about the cost of healthcare is prescription drugs, of course. I\u2019m still working on that, but if Canadians can get drugs for 25-50 percent of what Americans are paying, I\u2019m feeling fairly confident that \u201creform\u201d is greatly needed. Here are a few numbers in the reports:\nTotal Compensation to CEOs of Health Insurance Companies (2002)\nNorman Payson, M.D., CEO of Oxford Health Plans: $76,010,825\nLeonard Schaeffer, CEO of WellPoint: $21,765,532\nD. Mark Weinberg, executive VP of WellPoint: $14,046,201\nThe total of the twenty highest-paid executives in 2002 annual compensation, not including stock options: $237,907,917! Add to that the stock options: $1,153,864,691! Yes, that is a billion dollars! Together you are looking at $1.75 billion that went to twenty people in that industry in 2002. I think that answers the question I had about the profitability of health insurance companies.\nOn the subject of drugs: Public Citizen found that in 2002 the drug industry hired 675 different lobbyists from 138 firms in 2002\u2013nearly seven lobbyists for each US senator. The industry spent a record $91.4 million on lobbying activities in 2002, an 11.6 percent increase from 2001.\nFor the Health Insurance reports go to:\nwww.familiesusa.org\/site\/DocServer\/Top_Dollar_report.pdf?-docID=1381\nwww.consumersunion.org\/pdf\/medicare-603.PDF\nMy question: Why don\u2019t we eliminate the insurance part of healthcare?\nTEDDI CURTIS\nCorona, CA\nDear Teddi,\nThis is so informed that all I can say is RIGHT ON! I will publish your letter without a qualification from me except to say that my concerns are the same as yours, and my frequent points about the perils of privatized healthcare are complementary to your analysis.\nWould you be so kind as to share your observations regarding any possible psychiatric problems that could result from overuse of the Internet and other forms of electronic telecommunication?\nEVELYN HALPERIN\nAuckland, New Zealand\nDear Evelyn,\nThe word that comes to mind for overusers of the Internet is \u201cdepersonalization.\u201d The medium provides a great way of reaching out across oceans and across conceptual barriers, but, as with all two-dimensional mediums, it can be abused, with the risk of a loss of a sense of what\u2019s real. Emotions may become fractured, or anesthetized.\nI am a federal employee with numerous work-related afflictions that are mostly physical in nature. My problem is that my insurer requires considerable paperwork to document the necessity of my treatments, and most physicians I\u2019ve encountered are not good technical medical writers. Since most MDs also don\u2019t like to spend much time with worker\u2019s comp claims, and in particular federal claims, it becomes very difficult to get help with written claims, which I need for reimbursements. How can I help my doctor?\nJEFFREY S. GREEN\nPort Orchard, WA\nDear Jeffrey,\nLike any branch of medicine, you will do best with a specialist or doctor who tends to focus in the area you are concerned about. One of the problems with the work-related injury field is that not all physicians are experts in this sort of medicine. I suggest finding a physiatrist, or specialist in rehabilitation medicine, who makes these kinds of evaluations\u2013and has to write them up regularly\u2013on a daily basis.\nWhy do the majority of doctors, insurers and politicians ignore the issue of disease prevention and physical fitness? Like many things in our society, healthcare seems to focus on repairing the damage done. We have no focus on exercise, diet and other beneficial factors, such as relaxation. In the 1960s the Kennedy Administration started a national fitness program for elementary school children. This seems to have disappeared. President Bush seems to relish exercise and fitness, but he makes no attempt to pass it on to the plebes. Couldn\u2019t we save many billions simply by cutting down on obesity?\nTOM CARBERRY\nDenver, CO\nDear Tom,\nNo question that our society would do well to stress regular exercise far more than it currently does. The Atkins diet is for couch potatoes. Exercise and water are a lot less expensive than medicines and coffee. Our use-em-up philosophy works against us, as we use ourselves up and then seek replacement parts. And there are even numerous little things that most Americans can do without any radical changes in their lives\u2013walking up stairs rather than taking an escalator, for instance. Or walking a few blocks for that pint of skim milk, rather than driving. You don\u2019t need to join a gym to derive the benefits of simple exercise.\nI\u2019m an honorably discharged veteran who uses the VA as my primary healthcare provider. About two years ago I underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatment for sqamous-cell carcinoma for a tumor in my mouth at the Dallas VA. Since the treatment, I\u2019ve been going through depression, which I\u2019ve been told is not abnormal, considering the treatment. I\u2019m scheduled to see a psychologist (I think that\u2019s what he is) in regard to my mental health. Is there any way the Bush Administration can \u201cplay\u201d with the entitlements I was promised upon discharge? Bush seems to be cutting military benefits every chance he gets, and after what he did to our combat troops in Iraq, concerning a cut in combat pay, I\u2019m beginning to wonder.\nRICK HERRING\nFt. Worth, TX\nDear Rick,\nThanks for your refreshing perspective and honesty. And I wish you well in terms of your healthcare. As far as I know, VA benefits have not yet been touched, and in the current political climate, I doubt anyone would take such a chance\u2013though you never know what can be done either to manipulate the media or to slide under its radar.\nCan you advise me as to the best health insurance to get if I am self-employed, or direct me to a reliable source for this information? I remember that a few years back, the MacArthur Foundation awarded one of their \u201cgenius\u201d grants to a woman studying the issue of insurance for the self-employed, and\/or organizing group packages for freelancers.\nPAM GREEN\nPalm Springs, CA\nDear Pam,\nI see that you live in California, so I will be chastised by some of my readers if I fail to point out that many of the Western HMOs are not-for-profit, and are motive-distinguishable from the for-profit HMOs\u2014the anti-Robin Hoods of healthcare. That said, I really can\u2019t recommend one particular insurance over another, though I do believe that if you have a physician whom you trust, his or her office manager would probably have that information for your area. And that MacArthur grantee you\u2019re referring to was Sarah Horowitz, founder of a group called Working Today, which can be found at www.workingtoday.org.\nI just read the letter from your reader who caught tinea versicolor. My experience with travel in warm and\/or tropical climates taught me how to deal with another skin fungus: heat rash. The secret is, don\u2019t use soap on one\u2019s body. Soap leaves a residue that creates an environment for fungus growth under hot and humid conditions. The letter writer lives in Maryland, a place that\u2019s hot and humid in summer. He might be using regular soap on the body when he bathes. In that climate, it would be safer to use a mild detergent like phisoderm, which washes off completely and does not leave residue.\nJO KIRKPATRICK\nAustin, TX\nDear Jo,\nThanks! I think your advice is sound, though the rash one may develop from soap residual is often allergic in nature rather than fungal.\nI\u2019m the new parent of a 2-month-old boy, and soon it\u2019ll be time to decide on vaccinations. Until I started researching the issue, I thought everyone agreed that it was best to give shots to infants. But it seems that some possibly credible folks have serious reservations about doing so, stating that numerous shots aren\u2019t needed and\/or could be harmful to children. Should I get vaccinations for my child, and if so, which ones and when?\nZOE KOP\nWooster, MA\nDear Zoe,\nIt\u2019s a complex issue, because much of the purpose of the childhood vaccines is to help stamp out a serious disease across society, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your child will contract a given disease if not vaccinated. Many of the childhood diseases are rarer these days than they used to be. However, when the National Health Service stopped giving the measles vaccine in Britain for a period of months in a trial of new policy, the incidence of the disease increased, and they went back to regular vaccinations.\nOverall, I am in favor of all the recommended vaccines for infants and feel that they are safe. There is always room for further study, but at this point, the good seems to me to far outweigh the potential harm. (On a side note, I do not believe these vaccines should include serum made from bovine products in Europe.)\n}}

{{In a week when the NHS attracted furious front-page headlines for allegedly giving preference to providing drugs to save gay men from the risk of contracting HIV through \u201cunprotected sex\u201d over cataract operations to save the sight of the elderly, it seemed appropriate that I should last Monday have had a cataract operation myself.\nOn the several visits I have now made to our local \u201cNHS Treatment Centre\u201d in Somerset, I could not have praised its performance more highly. Without exception, from the reception desk to the medical team, the staff of this small modern hospital could not have been more efficient, helpful and cheerful. Free taxis to take me to and from home 10 miles away were available at the ping of a telephone call (and, for those able to drive, parking, in contrast to the exorbitant charges familiar at most other hospitals, is also free).\nMy two surgeons \u2013 one Indian, the other Iranian \u2013 could not have been more friendly or competent. And even when a possible complication arose after the operation, I was rushed back in on Friday morning to see a third, young surgeon, who gave me a superbly clear explanation of what was going on that was wholly reassuring.\n}}

{{The recent deaths by suicide of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain have caused an outpouring of shock and grief on social media, and naturally raise questions as to how we can better support people with a mental illness at risk of self-harm. While sharing advice like \u201creach out to your friends and family\u201d and \u201cseek medical help\u201d is undoubtedly positive, actually \u201cgetting help\u201d in the Australian healthcare system can be both difficult to achieve, and very expensive.\nThe cost of getting well in Australia is keeping us sick | Fiona Wright Read more\nIf you have a Medicare card, visit a GP and present with signs of a mental health condition and\/or disorder, your GP can set you up with a mental healthcare plan which consists of 10 subsidised psychology sessions per year. For some people, 10 sessions a year is enough to talk through personal issues and work on developing effective coping strategies. For others with more complex or severe conditions or histories of trauma, 10 sessions barely scratch the surface. As a survivor of family violence (which we know is at epidemic proportions in this country), I have done years of work with various psychologists, and a great proportion has been paid for out of my pocket. The gap for psychology sessions tends to be anywhere from $40 to $100, depending on the charges of the psychologist or practice.\nPsychiatrists, unlike psychologists, are able to prescribe psychiatric medications. An initial consultation with a psychiatrist is around $360, with a Medicare rebate of $220, which leaves a gap of around $140. It generally takes a psychiatrist three 45-60 minute sessions to diagnose a patient and set up a treatment plan. This means the patient will be a minimum of $400 out of pocket before they are able to even start medication or treatment. The gap for psychiatry varies, but is around $67 for a half hour appointment and $114 for an hour.\nOnce you have spent $460 on the gap as an individual or as a family, you reach the Medicare safety net and receive back 100% of the scheduled Medicare fee for that particular service. However, this fee doesn\u2019t necessarily match what the medical specialist charges, and Medicare fees notoriously haven\u2019t kept up with inflation, which has left patients increasingly out of pocket. It also has to be noted, that a patient needs to pay for the session before they get the Medicare rebate. What this means is that if you don\u2019t have $360, for example, to pay the psychiatrist upfront, you can\u2019t go to the appointment.\nSteps towards making our society more equal would help to improve the mental health of those most vulnerable\nIf you can\u2019t afford to access assistance in the private sector, you will have to go through the public system, which is overloaded and can barely handle those who are at crisis level, let alone provide preventative care. The tragic story of Naomi Watson-Ley exemplifies this \u2013 she took her own life only days after being discharged from the psychiatric ward of a hospital.\nSeeking treatment takes time. If you need to take time off to go to the psychologist or psychiatrist (or both), that\u2019s time that you won\u2019t be able to work and make money. It\u2019s not hard to see why people just try and \u201cpush through\u201d only to end up more exhausted and sick than ever. How many employers are happy for someone to take several hours off every week or fortnight to go to medical appointments? How many employees are comfortable sharing this kind of information with employers?\nSeeking treatment can also be risky, because to open up and be vulnerable in front of a stranger (even if they are a medical professional) takes an enormous amount of courage and isn\u2019t always a safe option. Many marginalised people (such as people of colour, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, LGBTIQA+ people and sex workers) won\u2019t know if a specialist is bigoted or holds prejudicial ideas about the group they belong to, until they have opened up to them in the session. Bad experiences beget a distrust of the system in general, and discourage individuals from seeking further assistance in the future.\nIt comes as no surprise that those who are the most marginalised in our society, who are the least able to afford or access expensive psychiatric treatment, are also disproportionately affected by social issues that are likely to exacerbate stress and worsen mental health. Housing instability, unemployment (or underemployment) and financial pressure all cause stress that contributes towards making people feel worse about themselves and their future. Steps towards making our society more equal would help to improve the mental health of those most vulnerable.\nNDIS failing people with severe mental health issues, new report warns Read more\nTelling individuals with mental health conditions and\/or disorders to \u201cget help\u201d is easy. Changing the system to better serve the diverse Australian population is much harder.\nNone of the answers to these questions are easily solved, but what begs understanding is that \u201cseeking help\u201d is only possible when the services are available and accessible for everyone. We need to care more about mentally ill people when they are alive, and not only after they have taken their lives.\n\u2022 Adele Perovic is an actor and journalist based in Brisbane\nIn Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

{{It is imperative that disease prevention and health promotion become greater priorities in our health care. The majority of money spent in healthcare is focused on treatment and care rather than health prevention and promotion, which will no doubt enhance the lives of Jamaicans. Preventing a disease before it starts is critical to helping people live longer, healthier lives and to keep health cost down.\nSTARTLING FACTS\nn According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016, of the top 10 global causes of death, six are non-communicable diseases.\nn As it stands, Ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the world's biggest killers, accounting for a combined 15.2 million deaths in 2016. These diseases have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.\nn Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease claimed 3.0 million lives\nn Lung cancer (along with trachea and bronchus cancers) caused 1.7 million deaths.\nn Diabetes killed 1.6 million people, up from less than one million in 2000.\nn Deaths resulting from dementia more than doubled between 2000 and 2016, making it the fifth leading cause of global deaths in 2016 compared to 14th in 2000.\nCURRENTS TRENDS IN JAMAICA\nThe aforementioned is true, as this information reflects the current trends in Jamaica.\nn Statistics show that NCDs, otherwise called chronic lifestyle diseases, contribute to 70 per cent of mortality in Jamaica, with 34 per cent classified as premature, that is, before age 70 years.\nn Circulatory system diseases are the most prevalent (25 per cent), with similar male and female prevalence of hypertension.\nn The prevalence of diabetes is higher among women (9.3 per cent) than men (6.4 per cent).\nn The prevalence of overweight persons is 59.1 per cent, including 27.2 per cent who are obese.\nJAPAN'S EXAMPLE\nIn examining the healthcare system in other countries, it is noted that Japan has a comprehensive system of screening, tracking and follow-up. Employers are required to conduct annual health screenings for every employee; dependents are covered by corporate schemes.

{{Feds: Don't lie about healthcare reform on Facebook The government releases strict draft guidelines for how private Medicare providers should use social media\nA tweet from biotech\/pharma industry watcher Sarah Vogel points us to an interesting document from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) outlining \"draft guidance on allowable usage of social networking sites\" by Medicare Advantage providers and other private sector entities that deliver Medicare benefits -- known collectively as \"plan sponsors.\"\nI was amused by this section:\nAdvertisement:\nThe public interactive features of social networking sites must be disabled. For example, interactive features such as chat, messaging, blogging, or wall discussions will not be permitted, given that these features encourage ongoing interaction with beneficiaries which, by their nature, are not reviewed by the plan sponsor in advance and could not receive CMS prior approval.\nFurthermore, \"plan sponsors cannot use social networking sites as a means to initiate unsolicited contact.\"\nIf you subtract \"chat, messaging, blogging and wall discussions\" from a social networking site, and prevent employing the features of the site to approach other users, what exactly do you have left? A static Web page? What is the point behind creating guidelines for use of social networking sites that forbid any social networking?\nBut looking a little closer, we see that the one of the reasons cited for the guidelines is \"to ensure that plan sponsors are not using these social networking sites in ways that... violate the Medicare Marketing Guidelines.\"\nAnd that seems to be the key. As Dawn Teo reported last September in the Huffington Post private Medicare providers have been notorious scare-mongers on the topic of health care reform. Some have sent mass mailings to their plan beneficiaries warning them off all sorts of horrible things that might happen after reform -- benefits cut, drugs no longer subsidized, et cetera. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not look fondly on such behavior.\nTeo:\nAccording to a source with inside knowledge of the way CMS regulates marketing guidelines, Medicare providers are only allowed to communicate with plan members about the benefits they have now, not about possible changes to benefits. They are also not allowed to use plan-related communications to lobby for policies or legislation.\nSo the draconian guidelines on social networking seem at least partially designed to prevent Medicare Advantage providers from using those networks to do what they do best: spread viral messages intended to rally support for an agenda. We'll see how well that works.\n}}

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.\nJim Gustafson\nThank you Colene and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today in the room are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer, and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.\nPlease note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.\nAdditionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.\nKent Thiry\nThank you, Jim. As you probably already noted, we had solid fourth quarter results that were consistent with prior communications and of course J.R. and Joel will discuss those in greater detail a little bit downstream. But we are first and foremost a caregiving company and so as usual we will start by talking about a clinical highlight today, Antibiotic Stewardship.\nAs many of you know, dialysis patients are highly prone to infections. We have continued to get better at supporting evidenced based prescribing of antibiotics, which has a couple of benefits, including reducing harm to patients from excessive antibiotic use and also preventing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This is something that all caregivers should be doing across American and Global Health Care and we are proud that we are getting better.\nIn fact in 2018, among patients with symptoms of Blood Stream Infections, we actually decreased IV antibiotics starts by 12% while maintaining all clinical quality. This is important not only in terms of what we did this year, but we continue to collect data to improve our ability to do even better in the future.\nNow, a quick update on the DMG transaction. We are working closely with Optum to obtain FTC approval, which of course is necessary. The timing of the process was very negatively impacted by the government shutdown as it was for so many other transactions and we cannot speak definitively to the timing for all the reasons we haven't been able to do that up to this point and all the same reasons that other companies involved in other transactions cannot. But everybody's working very diligently to move that ball forward.\nIn addition, some good news is that in 2019 the DMG Financial performance will improve \u2013 is expected to improve significantly. There are a number of very tangible reasons for this. One for example is significantly better Medicare advantage rates than in prior years; number two, the elimination of the health insurer fees, a dollar for dollar significant pick up; number three, the dollar for dollar elimination of considerable consulting expenses incurred in 2018 that will be gone in 2019; and fourth, the number of operating improvements, investments that we made in prior years that are bearing fruit. So the net is that 2019 DMG would be significantly better as is expected to be significantly better than 2018.\nNow over to Javier for a summary of our Kidney Care business.\nJavier Rodriguez\nThank you, Kent and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll cover two topics. First, I'll provide a recap of our financial performance, and second, I will discuss the legislation recently introduced in California.\nFor the fourth quarter 2018 our results are in line with our guidance. Adjusted operating income was $370 million for the quarter and $1.513 billion for the full year. Our 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations also came in line with guidance at $1.48 billion.\nRelated to cash flows, our 2018 CapEx spend came in better than our guidance and we are guiding to a lower spent in 2019. There are several drivers to this declining CapEx spend, two of which are worth calling out as they should decrease the CapEx spend on new centers in the next couple of years.\nFirst, we continue to focus on driving the right modality for our patient. For many of them dialyzing at home may be the best option. Now that we have a more secure supply on PD products, we anticipate more patients will be able to choose home dialysis. In fact, in 2018 we trained and educated over 13,000 new home patients. As you know, home growth has an incremental benefit of being more capital efficient.\nSecond, as we mentioned earlier this year, some recent data suggests that ESRD industry growth may be slowing, but we don\u2019t know whether this is a short term impact of increased transplantation availability or whether there is a long term implication in the immediate term we plan to build fewer centers to keep pace with patient demand.\nNext, as many of you know Q4 includes open enrollment decisions for many of our patients. Overall we observe stable results from open enrollment, which is consistent with our expectations. In the individual markets in particular, we saw slightly higher reenrollment than we experienced over the last couple of years. We believe that these results set us up to deliver on 2019 guidance we shared last month, which Joel will cover later.\nNow, let me transition to a legislative update in California. A member of the assembly has reintroduced effectively the same legislation at last year's SB 1156, which was vetoed by the Governor because of the potential harm to patients. This new bill, AB 290, seeks to impose rate cuts on dialysis providers for their support of premium assistance charities and impose restrictions on charitable premium assistance for patients with pre-existing conditions and end-stage renal disease. Our coalition of dialysis patients, physicians and caregivers in California will of course fight to defeat this conceived bill.\nFinally, let me finish by saying that we continue to build our integrated care capabilities, which are helping us care for patients in a more holistic way. Let me provide a couple of examples; first, we developed a predictive model that incorporates lab data, dialysis, treatment data and claims data to determine which patients are at the highest risk of hospitalization over the following month. Second, we now have a team of nurse practitioners dedicated to addressing a broad range of primary care needs on a more real time basis for our patients.\nWe believe that these capabilities will improve the quality of life of our patients, while reducing costs to the system, and of course we look forward to providing this coordinated care to many more patients in the future.\nSo in summary, overall solid quarter and we continue to focus on delivering high quality care for our patients.\nNow, on to Joel for financial details on our results.\nJoel Ackerman\nThanks Javier. Let me walk you through some components of our U.S. Dialysis and Lab Segment. First, growth; our treatment per day growth in Q4 was 3.1% and normalized non acquired growth was 2.6% as we continue to see a decline in volume growth. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to range between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2019.\nNext on revenue; revenue per treatment was down $0.65 from Q3 to Q4. If you exclude the impact of calcimimetics, revenue was up a little more than $1 per treatment sequentially. To give some perspective on this for the full year, commercial RPT for the year was down approximately 1% as we shifted out of network business to in network, which offset commercial rate increases that we've achieved across much of the portfolio.\nFor the year commercial mix was down approximately 10 basis points from 10.5% in 2017 to 10.4% in 2018. We believe that our decline in mix was consistent with the demographic headwind that we have previously outlined.\nFinally on revenue, our strategic initiative revenue was negatively impacted by our previously announced wind down of DaVita Rx. DaVita Rx revenue was down approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter and Q4 is reflective of the go-forward run rate.\nOn costs, patient care cost per treatment was up $1.26 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional fees. Dialysis and Lab Segment G&A was down quarter-over-quarter approximately $4 per treatment, $2 driven by a decrease in advocacy spend and the remainder due to normal quarterly spending fluctuations.\nFor international, we achieved a slightly positive adjusted operating profit for the quarter, excluding the FX impact of our joint venture in Asia. We expect positive operating income from international operations in 2019, excluding any FX impacts, which are incorporated in our enterprise guidance. For the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 24.3% and for the year it was 29.2%.\nThe effective tax rate was unusually low for Q4 as a result of the positive quarterly true-ups for our federal, state and international accruals. It\u2019s unusual that all of these moved in the same direction in one quarter.\nNow on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $307 million for the quarter and $1.48 billion for the year, in line with our previous guidance. I'll conclude by reiterating our 2019 guidance. We expect operating income to be between $1.54 billion and $1.64 billion. As a reminder, the first quarter had seasonally low operating income as the quarter is shorter with 76.6 treatment days, meaning lower treatment volumes and fewer treatments over which to absorb the fixed costs. Also Q1 has higher seasonal payroll tax.\nOur 2019 guidance includes the following expectations; 3% to 4% U.S. total treatment volume growth. 0% to 1% U.S. revenue per treatment growth and 0.5% to 1.5% U.S. cost per treatment growth.\nWe are initiating 2019 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.375 billion to $1.575 billion. In 2019 we expect $800 million to $840 million in CapEx from continuing operations.\nThis range includes CapEx for self-developed real-estate projects that are offset by proceeds from the subsequent sale leaseback transactions. We expect approximately $100 million of proceeds from self-developed projects in 2019 leading to net spend of approximately $720 million at the midpoint.\nFor comparison purposes, in 2018 our CapEx from continuing operations was $902 million and we received proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of $45 million for a net of $857 million. You can see the historical detail in section six of our supplemental financial data in our earnings release.\nFinally, we expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be 28.5% to 29.5%. As always, our guidance captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below the estimates provided.\nNow I'll turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks.\nKent Thiry\nI like to just make a few comments for: Number one, please be reminded that the next few years Medicare year-over-year fee for service rate increases will be better than the almost zero increases over the last few years.\nSecond, the international business now has a foundation on which we can expect year-over-year or like contributions rather than offsets.\nNumber three, we continue to generate strong cash flows and they are fact incrementally better than some of the prior years.\nAnd four, we are very well positioned to be a differentiated high value added provider integrated care for these needy and expensive patients.\nOperator, lets switch to Q&A please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKevin Fischbeck\nGreat, thanks. I guess we want to start of with DMG as a question. I appreciate if you can\u2019t say exactly when it\u2019s going to close, but I didn\u2019t see your comment review that you are still confident that it\u2019s going to close. Just want to make sure that from your perspective everything is still on track and it's just a matter of timing at this point.\nKent Thiry\nYeah.\nKevin Fischbeck\nOkay, great. And then I wanted to talk a little more about the slowdown in growth that you are seeing and expecting from a treatment perspective. I missed, I think you mentioned something about factors that may or may not be temporary. Can you talk a little bit about what those factors are and if there is anything else that you are thinking about or thinking about what organic growth should look like?\nJavier Rodriguez\nYeah, thanks Kevin. This is Javier. We started to see a bit of a slow down on new starts in the back end of the year and that's why when we provided guidance, you saw the number came down to 2.5 to 3.5 of non-acquired growth. Some of the factors that are still in play are what's happening upstream with other comorbid conditions and how that is impacting, how many patients have ESRD, and another dynamic is how many organs are gone into that transplant pool, as the number of organs has picked up due to the opioid crisis with many people being young and having healthy kidneys. So there is a lot inter played, many dynamic upstream and so we are trying to see if they are short term or if they are going to be longer term.\nKevin Fischbeck\nOkay, from your perspective, the new starts that you are doing over the next year, is that going to position you for inline industry growth, market share gains, market share loses, how are you thinking about that?\nJavier Rodriguez\nI\u2019m sorry, are you asking how we are positioned within that growth? Is that the question?\nKevin Fischbeck\nYeah, your guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, does that mean that you expect to gain share or are you going along with what you think the market overall should be growing.\nJavier Rodriguez\nYeah, in the last couple of years, actually not the last couple of years, maybe the last couple of decades we've outperformed a non-acquired growth. We believe that there's nothing in the data that would say that we would not do that and so right now we are just looking more at the market dynamics overall.\nKevin Fischbeck\nOkay, and then maybe a last question for now. On the commercial mix, I think you said that you know mix was down 10 basis points year-over-year in line with kind of what you would expect in all demographic trends to kind of argue for. But I think your guidance assumes that actually mix will be relatively flat. So I\u2019m not sure if the demographics point to a decline each year, how you're thinking about being flat you know in 2019?\nJoel Ackerman\nSo Kevin, its Joel here. The demographics are certainly a headwind, about 10 basis points a year. We see opportunities to offset the headwind through upstream, education of patients, as well as helping them with their insurance once they\u2019ve come on dialysis. So we see opportunities to offset the headwind, but we do see the headwind persisting.\nKevin Fischbeck\nOkay, alright great. Thank you.\nKent Thiry\nThank you, Kevin.\nOperator\nThank you and our next question comes from that Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nJustin Lake\nThanks, good morning. First, let me follow up on Kevin's question around the deal close. I understand the government shut down and delayed everything, but the last thing you had talked about was expecting the deal to close in the first quarter.\nSo with the government shut down about 30 days, you know that would take us out to end of April. Is that still kind of where you would expect or do you feel like the first quarter, even ex the government shutdown, you know things have changed?\nJoel Ackerman\nYeah, so Kevin its Joel here. We are certainly still trying for Q1, that is a real possibility, but the government shutdown has certainly lowered the odds of that happening.\nJustin Lake\nIs there anything new besides the shutdown that would change that trajectory?\nKent Thiry\nJustin, there is always a lot going on and [Audio Gap] nothing new would suggest that nobody's doing any work, nobody's asking any questions. But Joel\u2019s answer still applies, were we are hired with a goal that he cited.\nJustin Lake\nNo problem. And then on the California legislation, just given this is the second time they are coming here and they've got a Governor that you know might be more likely to actually sign this legislation if it gets past. Curious if you can help us, you know put a range around the potential financial impact that we should think about for 2020 if this legislation does pass.\nKent Thiry\nYeah Justin, as you can imagine the legislation moves and there's different ways to interpret and of course you can never predict how it'll play out, but to try and be constructive and give you a range, I think it would be useful to have somewhere in that $25 million to $40 million as a range.\nJustin Lake\nThat is helpful. I will jump back in the queue. Thanks guys.\nKent Thiry\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tanal\nThank you guys, good morning. I guess just on the slower normalized, non-acquire treatment growth in the quarter at 2.6, is any of that attributable to pick-up in home dialysis or is that capturing that?\nKent Thiry\nThat is captured in there; the home growth is in the 2.6.\nSteve Tanal\nGot it, okay. And how are you thinking about home hemo. It\u2019s just a comment of sort of growing in the home and making that more available. Is that \u2013 that\u2019s sort of the new technology in the market. Are you guys planning for growth in that business or how should we think about that?\nKent Thiry\nWe\u2019ve been leading in home for as long as I can remember and we will continue to do what's appropriate for the patient and the right modality for each patient, so we of course assess technologies. There is a lot of talk of innovation, but if you really look carefully there's a lot of smoke in that innovation. It really is a lot of the same, and people are just trying to talk up their products. But we of course love it when there's something that's good for the patients and we will pursue whatever is best for them.\nSteve Tanal\nOkay, got it. Then just on the slower De Novos, can you give us a sense for what you are planning for \u201919 and how you are thinking about sort of the number of opening of longer term at this point.\nKent Thiry\nSure. So I\u2019ll preface the answer by highlighting the fact that there is a lag between the slowing of growth and the slowing of the De Novos. De Novos that are coming on now are decisions that were made, they are leases that were signed a year or two ago. So with that said, we are looking at a significant slowdown in De Novos in 2019 and we think that will continue going forward. I\u2019ll highlight that it's a function of two things. One, it\u2019s a function of the slowing NAG; it's also a function of the growing home. And you know as more and more patients are dialyzing at home, our need for the traditional in-center dialysis, De Novos, comes down.\nSteve Tanal\nUnderstood, okay, got it. And then just lastly from me, just on the RPT side in calcimimetics, I think you had mentioned it was a $1 sort of headwind sequentially. Is that sort of calcimimetics in total added about $17. I think it was $18 in Q3 if I recall correctly?\nKent Thiry\nYeah, that's about right.\nSteve Tanal\nGot it, okay, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, Steve. And our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering\nGood morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Two questions, first one of the review per treatment. You talked about bringing more revenues from outer network to in network. We sort of estimated about 3.4% of revenues now, out network for your book of business. Is that in the ballpark or can you talk about that?\nKent Thiry\nI think that question has been asked for many years and I think we are not going to change our stance today to give more clarity on that. We try to be as useful as we could in January to provide some of the trends over the long haul and Kent talked about sort of a nine year trajectory of that number coming down, and I think that's as much as we can do right now.\nPito Chickering\nRight, fair enough. And then on the weaker growth in the quarter, can you sort of talk about any impact from wildfires or weather and then because it\u2019s sort of varied so much in fourth quarter versus what we saw through the rest of the year, is there any way of getting us any sort of monthly numbers, just so we can get a better feel for sort of what was the core growth rate and also the way you guys exited January.\nKent Thiry\nYeah, so nothing to point out relating to wildfires or any sort of one time stuff like that. In terms of monthly numbers, I don't think we are going to go to that level of granularity.\nPito Chickering\nOkay, fair enough. And then last question from a leverage perspective. As the DMG business hopefully gets sold, I think by the next three years, what\u2019s the right leverage ratio we should think about you guys running?\nKent Thiry\nNo real change to our thinking around that. 3 to 3.5 times is the range we expect to generally be in, although we have gone above that for a variety of reasons. Obviously we are well above that right now. But I think the 3 to 3.5 times is still the range to think about.\nPito Chickering\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Healy with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Healy\nHey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the past that as an industry you\u2019d be looking to introduce some proactive legislation in California. Can you just provide some color on what that legislation might look to do?\nKent Thiry\nYes, thank you Patrick. Of course, we are trying to make sure that we educate the legislators to understand all the dynamics that are going on in an ecosystem that is not something that they normally are discussing. And so in our legislation what we want to make sure is that whatever guardrails are needed so that everybody understands that the right patient that have continuity of care are getting access to charitable premium assistance, and so it's clarity on that is what we are trying to do as opposed to the bill now, which goes beyond that.\nPatrick Healy\nGot it, and the other thing is Kent I've heard you speak recently about desire to get more involved with the pre-dialysis CKD population. Any color on what kind of investment you may look to make there? Why you think there is opportunity for DaVita and just something that could better enable you to provide integrated care once patients are you know transitioning on to dialysis and you know better address the cost of the patients outside the clinic. Just any color around that would be helpful? Thanks.\nKent Thiry\nWe will be able to add significant, really impressive clinical and economic value if we're allowed to move upstream and help take care of people who have kidney disease, but have not yet experienced kidney failure.\nAnd by intervening with those patients, in different ways we\u2019ll be able to delay the onset of dialysis and in some cases prevent it, and then not only delaying it, but also having people be healthier and have a healthier start to their dialysis. All of these improvements have big clinical and economic implications, but there's a bunch of regulatory work to be done, as well as contracting work to get there, and we are making some nice incremental progress, nothing to bake into any forecast yet, but we're working hard.\nPatrick Healy\nGot it, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from John Ransom, Raymond James. Your lien is now open.\nJohn Ransom\nHi, good morning, I went back and looked at some of the qualitative comments about commercial contracting all of last year and it seems like we ended up in a place in 2019 that was a bit below at least what I was expecting. So was the thought that you would always end up here or did we get some kind of late breaking news that caused the needle to move.\nKent Thiry\nJohn, obviously I don't know what\u2019s in your assumptions, but it came in line with what we were seeing and of course on any given time there's pluses and minuses. But for the year it was in line with what we expected.\nJohn Ransom\nI was just simply talking about the five to six large contracts being redone and you are pleased with the increases and I guess I was thinking zero to one wouldn't be what should be shooting for, but that's what I was referring to. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.\nKent Thiry\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Gary Taylor of J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nGary Taylor\nHey, good morning, just a few quick ones. For 2019, is the expected advocacy spend still in the $30 million range?\nKent Thiry\nGary, that is the additional spend from our regular advocacy spend, yes.\nGary Taylor\nOkay, that compares to the 93 extra last year, right?\nKent Thiry\nCorrect.\nGary Taylor\nAnd then I just want to make sure I understood in response to Justin's question on the California legislation, the equivalent of 1156. So you are saying if every CPA patient in California moved to the Medicare rate, it would be a $25 million to $40 million revenue in OI hits or there is some offset between revenue and OI?\nKent Thiry\nI\u2019m glad you are asking it Gary, because basically we didn't provide much detail because there are so many assumptions that go into it around a lot of dynamics and so what we are trying to do is just be useful and give you the top line, which is basically there is a range of $25 million to $40 million, but we are not going into specific dynamics.\nGary Taylor\nAnd that would be every CPA patient going to Medicare, right?\nKent Thiry\nLike I said, patience and the way the system will work is yet to be seen. So it\u2019s probably not good to assume anything, rather be constructive and give you the range of all of the dynamics going in there.\nGary Taylor\nOkay, last one is for CapEx can you tell us and I apologize if it is on that last page, but CapEx for new centers in 2018 and what you think that looks like for 2019 and in 2020. Just if you talked about your new center openings, I was trying to get a sense of the impact on annual CapEx there.\nKent Thiry\nGary, so we can't give you a specific number. There's a range built into that as we watch over the course of the year exactly how many De Novos get built, where they get built, what the cost per De Novo is. But it is safe to assume part of that significant decline from 2018 to 2019 will be the result of fewer De Novos getting built.\nBut let me jump in and just correct something I said before. There was a question about calcimimetics RPT and I think what I confirmed was a number of $17 just to be clear. $17 was the number for the year, the number in Q4 was about $16 of RPT.\nGary Taylor\nThat's it for me. Thank you.\nKent Thiry\nThank you.\nJoel Ackerman\nThanks Gary.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nHey, thanks. On the commercial book, how much of your contract or how much of your book is set to reset in 2019. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you know what your expectation is for renewals in 2019 and what the expectation is for revenue for treatment. Thanks.\nA - Kent Thiry\nThanks Whit. We don't disclose how many contracts are up on any given year and so I can't give you that. What we guided to at JPM was that the commercial book would be down 1% to up 0.5%.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nFor 2019?\nKent Thiry\nCorrect.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nOkay, looking at the deceleration in treatment growth, I know that we are all you know speculating and guessing on a lot of the contributing factors, whether it\u2019s better insurance management transplants or whatever. But have you been able to size maybe internally what do you think some of these contributing headwinds are, just to maybe help frame up for us how to get from Point A to Point B?\nA - Joel Ackerman\nYeah Whit, so we spend a lot of time on that. It's challenging because the data bounces around and a lot of the data we are using comes on a really long lag. So how to assess kind of current numbers is more challenging than we like. So I don't think we can be particularly helpful in trying to break down how this \u2013 how the deceleration comes about from the different components.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nI think we're all trying to do the same exercise. Looking at G&A in the fourth quarter, if we exclude the $30 million of advocacy costs in California, it would have been around $180 million and I know that there are quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but it still stands up a little bit lower than I would have expected and I guess I'm just trying to think about the starting point into 2019. Is this the new run rate? You know just any color to put the G&A trend for this year into perspective.\nKent Thiry\nYeah, it is \u2013 it does bounce around as you pointed out. I don't think there's anything major that we would call out for Q4 or in the year-over-year numbers, so roughly flattish would be a reasonable expectation for 2019, and that's on a per treatment basis.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nOn a per treatment? Maybe two other quick ones and I don't know if you\u2019ve disclosed this metric before, but any idea how much of your total treatment mix is Medicare advantage today or you know maybe another way to get a more responsive answer is like I think CMS is five, the industry around 20% of total treatments. Any reason that you\u2019d be you know different one way or the other and I guess I'm trying to sort of gain some insight into 2021 and maybe where you think that that mix can go over time?\nJoel Ackerman\nYeah, thank you. We have not disclosed our MA mix and we're not going to disclose our MA mix, but as you try and look out at what happens into the future, it's difficult to predict, because as you can imagine individual\u2019s will make their own decisions. But maybe one reasonable assumption could be that it's in line with the overall market, which is around 35%.\nBut as you know, individual decisions, there's going to be a consideration on co-pays and deductibles and out of pocket and coordination of care. They are going to try and see if physicians are in their network, etcetera. So to try and guess that on a total population is hard, so we of course have done some modeling and right now a reasonable assumption is it'll be in line with the overall market.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nOkay, thank you and just one last one. Joel, you decided to increase professional fees. Any more color there? Thanks.\nJoel Ackerman\nReally nothing interesting there. Some legal stuff is probably the biggest component of that, but really it\u2019s just kind of normal fluctuations up and down.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nAnd that\u2019s in \u2013 is your professional fees, is that flowing through G&A?\nKent Thiry\nNo.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nIt\u2019s in your \u2013 it\u2019s in the cost number, patient care.\nKent Thiry\nWell, it\u2019s in both. I think my recollection, and I'll get an answer for you in a second is that most of the swing up is in the patient care side.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nOkay. So nothing in the ancillary segment that would be allocated?\nKent Thiry\nNo.\nQ - Whit Mayo\nOkay, thanks guys.\nKent Thiry\nThanks.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Jeff Gate for Gates Capital. Your line is now open.\nJeff Gate\nYeah, I'm looking at the U.S. dialysis segment margins and if I exclude the so called incremental advocacy costs and if I exclude the calcimimetics \u2013 however you pronounce it, revenue, and then if I moved $25 million per quarter out of 2017 numbers. If I added back because of the, we\u2019re moving the 401 K benefit, I'm showing that underlying comparable U.S. dialysis margin was actually up for the year and I just wanted to confirm that that math was approximately correct.\nKent Thiry\nYeah, I'd suggest we kind of take this offline. I'd be happy to walk it through with you. I'm not 100% following your math. So why don't you reach out to Jim Gustafson and we\u2019ll follow-up on this.\nJeff Gate\nOkay.\nOperator\nThank you, and our next question comes from Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nJustin Lake\nThanks for taking another question, I just got a few more here. Commercial price, so just trying to come at this another way, you said 60% of the outlier water rates have normalized over nine years. Maybe you could tell us how much more normalization you are kind of assuming for 2019. Kind of where would we end this year at?\nKent Thiry\nAlright, Justin I just think talking about it year by year, it is just not reflective of reality, which is why we gave you the long term data. We pledged many years ago to work down the outlier part of the book in a constructive way and in some cases that can be easy-peasy. You got a payer that\u2019s got some really high rates and some really low rates and so you move everything to the middle on sort of a net neutrality basis.\nIn other cases it's not so simple, but that's what we said at the historical data is, so that people know that over a period of many years it has not lead to any material disruption, although there have been give good quarters and bad quarters and good years and bad years, and it's quite unpredictable. And so once again we give you the empirical data, so you can see that it is relatively predictable over the long term, but not over the short term.\nSo guessing and giving you a guess on a single year, we just think could be really a lot more noise than data. We do however are commit to our belief that over the next five, six, seven years, this trend towards fewer outliers will continue and there'll be some bumps that are positive and some bumps that are negative along the way, but it shouldn't be anything fundamental.\nJustin Lake\nRight. I guess you know I'm sure you can understand, investors are trying to figure out the potential impact and you know this year there was \u2013 you know you have zero kind of built in for commercial rate growth give or take. So you know given you normally get increases in contractors as you said, we\u2019re just trying to figure out like is this a nor \u2013 is this what we should consider a normal year over the next five to six that you talked about or is this a you know a bigger year of these outlier rates moving to normal.\nKent Thiry\nYeah, I don't think we can say. We put a lot of work into giving the guidance for this year, we're going to put a lot of work into providing the three year outlook at our upcoming capital markets in 2019, but I\u2019m just spontaneously trying to figure out where in that the word normal applies to that particular number in the particular year of 2019. I don't think I want to say \u2013 we don't want to say either yes or no to what exactly is normal. Hopefully we really helped you understand that.\nClearly there's some offsets in \u201819 that are offsetting the fact that in a lot of our books we're getting nice rate increases. So that is going on and we've done our best job at calibrating it for you, but I wouldn't want to characterize it as either normal or abnormal. If you look over the next, the last eight, nine years, it\u2019s not an outlier, it's just a tough year.\nJustin Lake\nOkay, and then just switching over to volume, you know obviously you've got a ton of medical directors who are nephrologists and I assume they are seeing upstream, their pre-ESRD patients, and so I'm curious what they are telling you in terms of this slowdown in you know patient growth. Are they saying that you know people are taking longer to you know \u2013 if they are able to prevent the kidneys from fully failing, so that's why it\u2019s slowing or are they seeing an actual slowdown in growth in pre-ESRD. I would have assumed that would be something that you would be able to you know see coming from a pretty long distance.\nKent Thiry\nIt's a fair question and as you know there's a wide distribution of sophistication of the way that the practices are ran from very small practices to large practices. With the people that I'm talking to Justin, they have not seen their CKD practice slowdown in any significant way, but one can never put too much stake in that, because the reality is that many of these practitioners are not that sophisticated that their practice is busy and they don't segment, as well as a sort of a Fortune 500 would. But at the end of the day there's nothing that they are picking out.\nA - Joel Ackerman\nAnd Justin, it\u2019s worth throwing out a few numbers to help explain why JR\u2019s answer is the appropriate one. You just take a typical mythology group and say there's three doctors and say they've got 100 dialysis patients each, that\u2019s 300, and then there's a 13% mortality rate let's say. So that's 39 patients to replace the ones that passed away. And then you have 3% growth and so you add another nine patients on, and so you\u2019re talking about 48 new patients per year spread across three doctors.\nWhen you have a 1% change in the organic population, you are talking about two patients difference over the course of an entire year and settle up whether or not a group has 48 new patients or whatever number spread across 12 months or 50 or 46, that is not something a practice can notice, because year-by-year they are going to have those fluctuations. It\u2019s not going to have anything to do with the aggregate CKD incidence or advancement and so that's why JR\u2019s answer to the practice wouldn't pick up on this, unless it was way, way, way more than 1%.\nFor us in aggregate and for you we pay a lot of attention to 1%, because there's some incremental EPS math attached to it, but it's highly, highly incremental and not discernible at the practice level with rare exceptions.\nJustin Lake\nOkay. Just a few other numbers questions here. You mention international as getting to profitability. Can you give us any kind of trajectory there, maybe a margin kind of target over the next few years that we think, you know you think would be a reasonable range to think about where this business can operate.\nKent Thiry\nYeah Justin, we're not going to \u2013 we're no longer going to call out specific guidance for international. We will continue to report on it every quarter, but given the magnitude in the context of the whole company, we don't think guiding on it as a specific number is something we're going to do.\nJoel Ackerman\nBut we will add just to try to be a little responsive without going into misleading details there. We've had three consecutive years of improving the EBITDA margin by 2% per year. So just to give you a sense of the incremental operating improvements and mix improvements, so things are moving in the right direction, we can say that right now.\nJustin Lake\nOkay, but no even target margins?\nA - Kent Thiry\nI don't think that would be a good idea right now given the different country mix. It\u2019s heavily influenced by which countries grow the most and sometimes you might have a lower margin country, but in fact it's got higher return on capital and so it \u2013 I don't think \u2013 it wouldn't yet be a useful number for you Justin.\nJustin Lake\nOkay, and then two more here. The CapEx, you know that\u2019s before where your CapEx can go and Joel you said CapEx couldn't you know materially decline over you know some period of your time if your De Novo\u2019s moderate. Can you give us an idea of what kind of you know \u2013 you know if you had to look today and obviously this takes years to kind of play out because of how far you have to plan them ahead, but two or three years from now, given the growth you are seeing in the business, what kind of CapEx moderation do you think can happen here from that net you know seven and change number that you are reporting for this year.\nJoel Ackerman\nIt's hard to predict Justin. We're just not in a position right now to give kind of multiyear guidance on this. It will depend on a bunch of things, including growth and depending on what happened to the growth, whether this decline is temporary or not, as well as what happens to home penetration and other things. There can be some real impact on that number, but we are not in a position to give longer term guide.\nJustin Lake\nNo, I apologize, but I thought you said it was material. You know it could be a material decline if the growth continues and you continue moving towards home, which it sounds like you are trying to, so I\u2019m just trying to get some order of magnitude. I understand if it were to re-accelerate you\u2019d have to spend more money. But just at this growth rate, in both of those factors, where do you \u2013 you know what would you call material?\nKent Thiry\nYeah, we're not in a position to quantify what exactly that would mean right now.\nJustin Lake\nOkay, last one on Medicare advantage. I know to which question you \u2013 it was helpful to say that you \u2013 that you think you can get to an industry average over time in Medicare advantage penetration. But obviously the starting point is pretty important and I just recollect you guys having said 10% to 15%. That was kind of the range of where you were today. Am I wrong in picking that number up?\nA - Kent Thiry\nWe're looking around the table Justin and no one remembers ever having shared that number, which is not to say it didn't happen, but there's just a bunch of blank stares across the table.\nJustin Lake\nOkay well, then I'll come out with a different way. You know obviously we\u2019ve talked about this being a potential meaningful positive. To get in getting the 35%, 40% where the industry is going to be a few years from now, it obviously could be significant, but not understanding where the starting point is. There's no way to say whether that\u2019s even going to be a benefit or not, unless we understand the starting point. Is there any way you can give us you know even a round number, 10%, 20%, 30% of where you are today?\nA - Kent Thiry\nYeah, hey Justin, I want to predict this, because we weren't prepared to do that for today but you are making a fair point. So this is obviously a multiyear issue and we do expect our MA to grow in a non-trivial way and it's going to be great for patients and we think great for the system, because it will also bring down total cost. But none of that is responsive to the specific starting point question. So if you just let us not make a spontaneous decision here, instead think about it and then maybe next quarter we'll provide that number.\nJustin Lake\nI appreciate it. Thanks for all the questions.\nA - Kent Thiry\nYeah, thanks Justin.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Ransom\nHi, let me just go back one more time on something. So you mentioned wanting to get more involved in pre-CSRD and it would involve some contracting. Is it you know the commercial payer has only been on the hook for 18 months and then Medicare being kind of slow. Are we talking probably the Medicare advantage payers would be most receptive to do some different type of contracting that would actually incentivize you to keep people from crashing into dialysis or nothing about that long?\nKent Thiry\nNo, you are thinking about it correctly. You were already doing that work with some payers and both they and we believe were having quite an impact clinically and economically and so we would expect that to increase over time. However, right now there's not math associated with it that's exciting enough for you to bake it into any near term forecast. Hopefully the future rolls on and we get better and better at it and have more data to prove how good we are at it, it'll be more relevant to your model.\nJohn Ransom\nAnd is this part of the tuition from DMG or does this accelerate your learning curve in some of these risk based types of contracts.\nKent Thiry\nYes, there was some very good learning in both directions where DaVita Kidney Care was able to help DaVita medical group do better on kidney care patients, both dialysis and pre-dialysis and similarly DMG was able to help DaVita kidney care do better at managing down the total cost, and managing the economics of our dialysis patients. So it was a good, mutual, and it continues to be a good, mutual learning highway.\nJohn Ransom\nThe other question I had is our D.C. BC folks think that CMMI might do some different payment structures for home dialysis. So two questions; one, are you hearing any of that, number one; and then number two. Let's just waive a wand for example and say three years from now you've got a set of 12% of your patients, let's say it's 25%. How do you think about that at a high level from a return on capital or contribution margin total economic today across. Thanks.\nA - Kent Thiry\nYeah, I'll take a stab at it. Number one, CMMI is looking at a bunch of kidney care stuff, including eliminating some of the obstacles to home and PD growth and we are supporters of that and we're on regular constructive conversations with them about the best way to do it. We've had a series of meetings. We've also talked with other people and so we applaud a bunch of the stuff that they are looking at, and hope that they go ahead and put it in. I think there's a good chance that they will.\nAnd then second, if you waive that wand, that is a good world in a couple of different ways. One, it just significantly reduces the capital intensity of our business. Number two, there are some patients in America who would be happier or healthier on home that are not on it today, because of local practice patterns, nephrology group preferences, etcetera, and we've been growing homes steadily.\nJavier referred to the fact that we've been the leader for a long time in this and intend to remain the leader, but that doesn't mean that every single patient that should be on home or might be happier at home, is on it now. And so implication number one is that a step outside of capital intensity excuse me would be happier and in some cases healthier patients.\nHaving said all of that, that right now when people walk around saying that home is almost uniformly a better form of care for dialysis patients, it\u2019s factually incorrect and so for a lot of patients it leads to a better life. For a subset of patients it leads to better clinical outcomes, but not for everyone and what you tend to have is that the type of people who take the initiative and have the desire to dialyze at home are a fundamentally different type of patient on average than those who stay in the center.\nSo it's very, very difficult to do an apples-to-apples clinical comparison, because of the type of population you have that is willing to take on the burden and responsibility and risk of dialyzing at home.\nJohn Ransom\nSo thanks for that and last one for me. Just at a very high level for home, how much of the relatively minor mix in your opinion is qualitative factors around physician practice patterns versus quantitative and clinical factors?\nA - Kent Thiry\nCould you say the question again please?\nJohn Ransom\nProbably not, but I'll try. So what we have been told is that some of the shortfall and the growth has been kind of tiny, 20, 30 bips a year. What we've been told is that some of that is just physicians, not being trained physicians, not being in the rhythm of thinking about home and just the default answer is the clinic. You know whereas others, you know some patients don't belong at home as you mentioned.\nSo if you had to guess \u2013 if we normalize physician practice patterns across the country and everybody was thinking about it like this is the first option, look to the patient, how much we can, where can the mix go to just with the qualitative physician decision making versus some of the other factors you know around the famous structures and you know clinical offsets.\nJavier Rodriguez\nJohn, this is Javier. I think when we look around and we see the most, let's call it home champions, the most dedicated physicians that have a good education program and are really trying to champion the right modality for the right patient, you get into a low you know 20 or so mix. Maybe you get it up to 25 if they are really, really good, but that's on the high end and as you look around the world, that\u2019s probably also a good number to use.\nJohn Ransom\nThanks, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s all from me.\nKent Thiry\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKevin Fischbeck\nHey, just a few more from me. I guess I might have missed it, but did you say that the guidance for 2019 includes additional advocacy costs or is that included in the normal run rate spend?\nKent Thiry\nNo, it includes this $30 million which is consistent with what we\u2019ve said before and think of it as you know $60-ish million less than the $90 million something that we had in 2018. The point I think Javier was trying to make is that we\u2019ve always had advocacy costs built into our cost structure. It went up significantly in 2018 as a result of the California stop. So this $30 million is kind of the remnant of that California piece that will roll through. There is other stuff that\u2019s always been in there and that that hasn\u2019t changed.\nKevin Fischbeck\nOkay, great, and then some on home health commentary, obviously home health that you guys have talked about from time to time and have been supportive off it. But this is just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this feels a little bit more of a discussion that I\u2019m used to hearing from you guys.\nIs there anything, so obviously lower cap on density is good; it\u2019s good for some subset of the patients. So that\u2019s good, probably better for commercial patients, so that\u2019s good, but is there anything that you have to worry about as you move the home hemo, because one of the things that structurally I would think that you and Fresenius have.\nThere is some varied entry and that you guys already have you know bricks and mortar across the country to the extent that we create and push towards a less capital intensive model probably speaking. Does that create the potential for disruption or more competition that you were \u2013 so (a) am I off base on that concern and (b) is there any downside that you can think of as now that is towards home hemo getting bigger.\nKent Thiry\nYeah, so one of the most important things to remember is that our patients are big consumers of the entire healthcare system and by definition when your kidneys fail, you are fragile and you\u2019re quite sick. And so one of the things that\u2019s not discussed when discussing home is that the peritoneal cavity (a) there is an high infection and two that sometimes it doesn\u2019t last and sometimes it\u2019s probably not the right world.\nMost times it actually gives within two years or so and so if you were to look at a patient of ours, they are (a) hospitalized; home patients that are hospitalized and of course DaVita and Fresenius serve in the acute setting and then number (2) is approximately 85% of patients that treat at home will have to use an in-center at some point in their care. And so having the entire suite meaning the hospital, the clinic, and the home service is a very important part of the value proposition for a patient, because they want the continuity of care, they want their doctor to go from the hospital to the center to the clinic and then of course home.\nSo is that responsive to your answer.\nKevin Fischbeck\nYeah, no, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s \u2013 the bricks and motors always going to have an important role even if home hemo becomes a bit bigger than what it is now.\nAnd then, the other question I wanted to understand a bit more about the sale leaseback dynamic. Are you signaling that you plan on owning you rights as a percentage going forward through these sale lease backs or is this more just a method of financing that disruption and that you wouldn\u2019t expect to be leasing a higher percentage of your facilities going forward.\nKent Thiry\nSo Kevin, there is no real change in the amount of real-estate we are planning on owning, which is extremely low. What the dynamic here is that we have found rather than having someone else build the center for us and us leasing it, it is more cost effective for us both in terms of the capital and the ultimate lease expense for us to build the center and then sell the already constructed center.\nSo the impact on our cash flow is that we are \u2013 we have an increase in CapEx as a result of this which flows through the normal CapEx line. There is a net benefit which doesn\u2019t flow through the CapEx line, but is effectively, economically an offset to our CapEx when we sell this, when we sell the center.\nSo no real change in how the ultimate ownership of the center, but it does create a little noise on our cash flow that we wanted to really clarify and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added over the last few quarters how this plays out in table six, what the net kind of bring back against the CapEx is. We understand it\u2019s a little bit confusing, but we thought it was important to lay it out to make sure everyone has the clearest view of what the real CapEx and cash flow of the businesses is.\nKevin Fischbeck\nAlright, great. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open.\nWhit Mayo\nThanks. I just had a couple quick ones on those numbers kind of moving around versus my notes. So just want to make sure I\u2019ve got the correct headwinds and tailwinds written down. On the tailwind side for this year, I\u2019ve got DaVita Rx losses reversing to be a $25 million tailwind. I think Joel you cited now a net $60 million tailwind in California on advocacy and then maybe a $35 million pickup on Medicare rates. Are those the big buckets? Are those the right numbers, are we missing anything?\nJoel Ackerman\nI think the sizes are about right, the Medicare is actually a headwind. I\u2019m getting puzzled here what was you\u2019re\u2026\nWhit Mayo\nI guess I was thinking more just on the rate update.\nKent Thiry\nOh on the rate update, yes. I thought you were talking about the Medicare bad debt issue which is going to bring positive revenue.\nWhit Mayo\nYeah okay, is that in the ballpark, you know $35 million just incremental tailwind from the rate update.\nKent Thiry\nThat\u2019s about right.\nWhit Mayo\nOkay and then on the headwinds as you mentioned that you\u2019ve got a $36 million headwind from the Medicare bad debt recoveries and may be a $17 million reversal from DaVita Healthy Solutions. Any other major headwinds and are those the right numbers?\nJoel Ackerman\nThose are about right. DHS I wouldn\u2019t call it a reversal in an accounting standpoint. It was a -.it\u2019s the lack of, yes.\nWhit Mayo\nOkay. And so that implies\u2026\nKent Thiry\nThe one other thing I would point to was the retirement cost that we had in Q3. The number was roughly $25 million, $23 million precisely.\nWhit Mayo\nGot it. Okay.\nKent Thiry\nAdd that to the tailwind category.\nWhit Mayo\nYes. Got it, okay. And then one last one, just the calcimimetics landscape is like fairly fluid right now, some drugs coming on\/off at the market. Just what\u2019s the expectation for 2019 and I\u2019ll get off, thanks?\nKent Thiry\nYes. So I think you\u2019re exactly right. It is a very fluid situation. It is one of the largest components of the swing in our $100 million of OI guidance given the different ways it could play out. But roughly speaking kind of if you think about the middle of the range it\u2019s not a big change year-over-year, but again a lot of variability in terms of how it plays out.\nWhit Mayo\nSo, what would be the scenarios that would play out that would get you toward the low end versus the high end? Is there any way to share what would have to happen with calcimimetics to be within that range?\nJavier Rodriguez\nThe couple of dynamics that you have to consider are one, prescription patterns. In there you have the oral come down or go up or do physicians prefer IV or oral, so there is a mix in there. In addition then you have to consider whether more generics come in t0 market.\nSo if it\u2019s one player versus five players and what happens to pricing and so then of course you have a calculation on ASP that has got a lag, and has got a six-month lag in that. So those are the dynamics in play.\nWhit Mayo\nOkay. I lied, one last one just on ASP. Can you comment how ASP has trended the last six to 12 months, and what that implies for the next six months, and I promise I\u2019m off now.\nJoel Ackerman\nASP has trended down. And then as it relates to prediction, you can\u2019t have one because of all the things I just went through.\nOperator\nThank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor, J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nGary Taylor\nSee what happens when you move your call to the morning. Nobody knows how to get off the phone. Everybody is double dipping.\nI just had a quick one. I just want to go back to, while I had you, kind of this question about slower growth in the industry, and looking at the U.S. RDF data maybe there\u2019s a good reason why it\u2019s not good or comprehensive. But if you look at prevalent population growth before 2000 it was in the fives, from 2010 it was in the fours, since 2010 it\u2019s been in the threes. You know it\u2019s a couple of years lag, but it looks like it is poised to drop into the two\u2019s.\nSo when you look at kind of that bigger picture, the industry maturing, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re seeing something that looks more step function-ish than sort of that that long decline we\u2019ve seen over the last 30 years?\nKent Thiry\nNo. I would say the opposite probably is that the data is quite clear that nothing dramatic happens quickly, and yet the trend is the trend and we\u2019re not predicting any significant change in either direction of the trend. But recognize that there is an awful lot of dynamism underneath that number.\nOn the one hand treatment for diabetes and hypertension, some of the primary causes of kidney failure are getting better. So you could argue that that would lead to a reduction in dialysis patients. On the other hand the African-American and Hispanic populations are growing significantly in America, and they are far more likely to have kidney disease and kidney failure. So that pushes exactly the opposite direction and I could cite two or three or four other variables.\nSo under the surface of that long-term trend, which we think may very well continue without any significant discontinuity up or down, but underneath that are a lot of basic fundamental forces in American healthcare and American demographics and so it\u2019s very difficult to get too confident, because if any of those underlying trends change, that would in fact create some sort of discontinuity in the trend. It just hasn\u2019t for the past 25 years.\nGary Taylor\nGot you. I just thought the opioids transplant commentary was perhaps suggesting you thought you were seeing something more onerous or steeper. So I appreciate the clarification. Thanks.\nKent Thiry\nLet\u2019s stay on that for one second, because that is a perfect example of a new discontinuity, but we would also predict probably relatively temporary one and that we would say that five years from now the incidence of opioid abuse and people getting to the point where their kidneys fail because of the lack of treatment is going to be reduced dramatically, because already the leading indicators for that things like prescription patterns, prescription limitations, prescription oversight, clinic availability to help these people, all of that is fundamentally changing throughout America and is quite well-funded in many cases.\nSo that\u2019s a classic example of a new thing that has had a negative impact in some ways on us in the short term, but will probably on a relative basis become an incrementally positive one over the next five, six, seven, eight years. But it\u2019s once again very difficult to quantify and calibrate, because it has do with fundamental demographic issues and fundamental healthcare system issues.\nGary Taylor\nUnderstood! Thank you.\nKent Thiry\nThanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering\nHey, thanks, and thanks for taking all these, you know extra questions here. I want to take another crack at the organic treatment growth that you guys are \u2013 I mean where you guys have guided to versus what you did in the fourth quarter. Are they 2.6% in the fourth quarter guidance of 2.5% to 3.5 % for 2019?\nSo the new point of guidance is implying an upside versus what is it you\u2019re supporting and in fact they are calling the fourth quarter as the bottom of what the ranges can be. Can you give any additional color in terms of so why this has improved to the midpoint of your guidance for \u201819?\nJoel Ackerman\nI\u2019ll take a crack at that, although I don\u2019t think I got much to add. The number does bounce around a bit, and we tend to look at things, you know some thing\u2019s purely on a quarterly basis; other with a little bit of blending over time. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re blending the Q4 data point with some prior data and our go-forward model, so we come up with something that\u2019s in the 2.5% to 3.5% range.\nPito Chickering\nAlright, it is worth a try. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nAnd speakers, we show no further questions at this time.\nKent Thiry\nAlright, thank you all very much for your interest in DaVita. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator\nThank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect at this time.\n}}

{{To be fair, we\u2019re only a little more than halfway through the fourth quarter\u2019s earnings season. Much could still change on the proverbial \u2018back nine.\u2019\nOn the other hand, with most of the major names already reporting last quarter\u2019s results, where we are is close to where we\u2019ll be when the earnings season dust settles. And as it stands right now, last quarter\u2019s earnings growth for the S&P 500 was solid not because of technology stocks, but despite them.\nBlame Apple (AAPL), mostly. The company makes up roughly 3% of the S&P 500\u2019s total value, and even more in terms of net earnings. Its fiscal first quarter earnings may have reached a record-breaking $4.18 per share, but that growth was the result of stock buybacks. Total net income actually fell year-over-year \u2014 even if only slightly \u2014 after a long period of reliable growth.\nOther major names certainly acted as a drag too, however, with many of the sector\u2019s constituents relying on a healthy Apple. The S&P 500 Technology Sector Index is on pace to earn $17.54 per share for the last quarter of last year, up a mere 1.5% from the final quarter of 2017\u2019s bottom line. Operating margins fell, as did the amount of total revenue driven for the S&P 500 by the technology sector alone. A year ago, it chipped in nearly 13% of the S&P 500\u2019s total revenue. Last quarter, that figure was a tad below 11%.\nThe winners? Amazingly enough, healthcare and financials. The former\u2019s fourth quarter bottom lines are up an average of just under 20% year-over-year, while the latter\u2019s so far sporting a 26% improvement. Higher interest rates have helped banks.\nAll told, for perspective, the S&P 500 is now expected to earn $38.99 per share for Q4, up 15% from Q4 2017. But, that growth won\u2019t be led by its most familiar tech names.\nIt\u2019s not the end of the world. Indeed, it was the technology sector\u2019s outsized sales and earnings from a year ago \u2013 and a couple of quarters before and after \u2013 that was extraordinary, and unusual. In the midst of smartphone mania, the race to 5G, a shift toward subscription-based business models and the heart of cryptocurrency mania all materialized at the same time other industries were hitting a pre-tax-cut wall. More than anything else, last quarter\u2019s technology revenue and earnings lull is a return to the norm.\nBut, it\u2019s still noteworthy.\nTechnology\u2019s net-earnings contribution to the S&P 500\u2019s bottom line deteriorated in a big way in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s still the biggest contributor, but the financial sector and then the healthcare sector are actually earning their way into making a more significant impact than they had just a year earlier.\nSource: Standard & Poor's\nLooking ahead, the all-important tech sector is expected to see earnings growth this year after a lackluster 2018, but there\u2019s no clear picture as to how or why that growth may take shape.\nSource: Standard & Poor's, image made with TradeStation\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the healthcare and financial sectors, both of which are expected to see earnings growth this year by merely extending last year\u2019s pace of progress.\nSource: Standard & Poor's, image made with TradeStation\nFor investors, the implication is simple enough: The market\u2019s primary pace-setting sector \u2013 technology \u2014 is waning in importance to the overall bottom line. It\u2019s conceivable that even if all other sectors drive marketwide profit growth, it could feel as if the broad market is doing poorly\u2026 particularly if tech stocks fail to live up to relatively lofty earnings expectations. Perception can be powerful.\nAt the same time, for the few investors that drill down into the details, the \u2018pulse\u2019 of the market\u2019s overall earnings tide will increasingly lean on healthcare and financial stocks. Fortunately, both are already on a steady growth track.\nIt\u2019s a shift that will require investors to navigate the market\u2019s waters very carefully, which isn\u2019t atypical in the latter stages of a bull cycle.\nDisclosure: I\/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

{{After much handwringing over the HealthCare.gov website, which has suffered technical glitches from its very first day, a team of three 20-somethings decided to build their own site to help Americans access information about health plans more easily.\nCalled HealthSherpa, the site allows users to enter their zip code to compare health plans. Entering your zip code, for example, would bring up exchange plans available in your area, which you would also find on the Health Insurance Marketplace on HealthCare.gov, or your local state exchange.\nHealthSherpa also lets users filter by coverage options ranging from bronze, plans that covers 60% of expenses, to catastrophic, plans that only cover \"all expenses beyond a high deductible.\" Another menu, called \"subsidy,\" lets users enter household income and size to estimate if a user qualifies for subsidies that would help pay for a plan. If a user qualifies, the site prompts him or her to claim the subsidies through HealthCare.gov or a local state exchange.\nPlagued from launch, the HealthCare.gov software encounters problems when total number of visitors reaches around 20,000 to 30,000 , an official who asked to remain anonymous told the Washington Post. The issues have made for a disastrous rollout in which many have not yet been able to sign up for the plans they will be required by law to have come 2014.\nThe Washington Post further reported that the site's problems may be too complex to be resolved by the end of November, as the White House had hoped.\nThe HealthSherpa team, made up of George Kalogeropoulos, 28, Ning Liang, 27, and Michael Wasser, 26, of San Francisco, told Mashable about their project to address this issue over email.\nLiang and Kalogeropoulos manage a real estate startup site called RentMetrics, which helps users compare rent prices based on location and needs. Wasser runs a \"healthcare software consultancy.\" The three started HealthSherpa after they tried to find out about their own health insurance options through HealthCare.gov. When they realized the website was experiencing difficulties, they created their own.\n\"Given that the data was publicly available, we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through, and view available plans,\" the team said in an email.\nThe trio created a user interface to display data obtained from HealthCare.gov and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. They also compiled information by reaching out to state exchanges \"to get spreadsheets containing detailed premium information.\" Most importantly, they built an infrastructure strong enough to \"handle thousands of concurrent visitors,\" they said. (A claim they repeated in a recent Facebook post.)\n\"Several hundred thousand have visited the site since it was posted about a week ago,\" the team wrote. \"We\u2019ve heard from people of all ages and walks of life, and thousands of people have reached out to us directly via email, phone, and Twitter to thank us and to suggest features and request improvements.\"\nThe team stresses, however, that since it uses data from the HealthCare.gov website, it could not have created the site from scratch. At time of writing, the new site already had 33,871 Facebook likes on its 'about' page.\nWhile you cannot purchase a plan directly on HealthSherpa, the site redirects you to the insurer you've chosen. \"Tens of thousands of people have clicked through to buy a specific plan,\" the site developers said.\nUPDATE, Nov. 15, 1:05 p.m. ET: HealthSherpa reached out to Mashable to clarify that the Facebook post previously embedded above contained incorrect information posted by the site.

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.\nSTART SLIDESHOW :\nTop 25 S.A.F.E.

{{LAKE NONA, Fla. - A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the future site of the University of Central Florida Lake Nona Medical Facility.\nThe facility will be a joint-venture hospital and training facility for future physicians and clinical researchers. It's the first of its kind, and teams up the University of Central Florida College of Medicine and HCA Healthcare.\nDr. Deborah German, Dean of the UCF Medical College, said the full service hospital will provide all types of medical care to the community.\n\"It'll start small, but we'll have everything, surgery, labor and delivery, all of the things that a typical hospital has, and as it grows we'll add on those specialty centers that many health centers do get,\" German said.\nThe hospital will continue to elevate Lake Nona as a growing medical hub. Commissioner Jim Gray said the area already draws medical professionals worldwide with higher paying jobs.\n\"In today's world, everybody's chasing high quality employees, employees are what make company plans work and their employees love this lifestyle. It's the consummate live, work, play environment,\" Gray said.\nThe medical facility will also eventually support a cancer research center. Locally, scientists are already doing the work, but this will provide them with more resources.\n\"Without the clinical branch, they're unable to take their discoveries to the bedside, to the patient.

{{Four health-related organizations and the AARP are joining forces to pressure presidential candidates to make promises to reform the nation\u2019s health care system. Leaders of the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association are in Iowa today, riding a bus to 12 presidential campaign offices in Des Moines to drop off their demands in writing.\nDr. John Seffrin, the CEO of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, says their message is that to be a serious candidate for the presidency, that candidate must offer a plan to \u201cfix\u201d the nation\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d health care system. Seffrin says they want health care reform to be the number one domestic issue in the presidential campaign.\nAccording to Seffrin, one in eight cancer patients in the U.S. is uninsured. \u201cWe not only have 47 million Americans with no health insurance, but we have millions more that have insurance but they\u2019re underinsured,\u201d Seffrin says. \u201cSo when they face one of the chronic diseases\u2026they may not get the care they need.\u201d\nMichael Farley, the CEO of the American Diabetes Association, says the five groups involved represent 21 million Americans. \u201cThis is a great day because we have five organizations coming together to create and reinforce a presidential campaign agenda about quality health care, affordable health care coverage for every American,\u201d Farley says.\nIn addition to affordability, red tape and lack of access are key issues for the groups, according to Farley. \u201cWe face different challenges as five different organizations, but we are united all of the same values\u2026on health care reform,\u201d Farley says. The plight of the underinsured is just as troublesome of the uninsured, according to Farley.\n\u201cDid you know, for example, that 50 percent of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical bills, but two-thirds of those are actually because they\u2019ve had inappropriate health insurance to cover those needs?\u201d Farley asks. Activists from the Cancer Society and the Diabetes Association as well as the American Heart Association and Alzheimer\u2019s Association were along for the bus ride today, too.\nSimilar events were held in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 the states which host the opening events of the 2008 presidential nominating season.\n}}

{{Testifying before Congress this week, Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Consedine offered a blistering critique of the way the federal government is coordinating the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nIn particular, Consedine said the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has failed to issue numerous regulations regarding how states are supposed to implement key parts of the law such as health insurance exchanges.\n\u201cMost of these outstanding regulations address critical issues on the operations and requirements of key components of the Affordable Care Act, like health insurance exchanges,\u201d he said at the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health Hearing on Wednesday, Sept. 12.\n\u201cWe still lack clear direction and the flexibility promised us has not materialized, something that at this point poses a significant barrier to our ability to make informed decisions on issues that could impact the lives of millions of Pennsylvanians,\u201d Consedine testified. He said Pennsylvania is not an outlier in \u201cfeeling directionless on this road.\u201d Recently, Commissioner Consedine was asked to chair the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\u2019 working group to help identify unaddressed issues with health insurance exchanges. He said that so far, 22 states have signed up to participate in this working group.\n\u201cAs chair of this working group, my hope is that we may provide the needed direction, guidance, and support for all the states that are travelling on this road together so that we as regulators can help our states make informed decisions and minimize disruptions to insurance consumers and our markets.\u201d\nBut the lack of detailed information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he said, \u201chas put Pennsylvania, and many other states, in a very difficult position.\u201d\n\u201cWe are traveling down a road, directionless, while knowing the road will end soon,\u201d he told the lawmakers. \u201cJanuary 2014 is right around the bend. Pennsylvania, like many other states, needs final rules and guidance on Exchanges in order for us to determine what course is the best for our state.\u201d\nConsedine said these concerns and the absence of clear guidance prompted him to write a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebeliuss two weeks ago outlining 26 specific questions that Pennsylvania regulators felt needed to be answered to make an informed decision on exchanges.\n\u201cAs of the date of this testimony, HHS has not responded to our letter,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA poorly executed federal exchange launch and transition from current market rules to the new ACA rules could result in severe market disruptions and a weakening of states\u2019 control over their insurance markets,\u201d Consedine told lawmakers.\n\u201cContinuing without answers to these crucial issues is like driving down a winding road, at night, without any headlights \u2014 nothing good will come of it,\u201d he argued.\nHe told lawmakers that the final rule on \u201cexchange establishment,\u201d one of the few regulations actually released, had approximately 100 references to \u201cfuture\u201d or \u201cforthcoming\u201d guidance or regulation.\nTo date, he said, \u201cI am unaware of any of those regulations being published.\u201d\nStates are missing details regarding fundamental aspects of exchange operation, like application requirements, citizen and income verification and appeals processes \u2014 the list goes on and on, he said. \u201cHow is a state expected to develop its own processes to interface with an exchange if the requirements for those functions have not been identified?\u201d\nThe full transcript of Commissioner Consedine\u2019s testimony can be found on the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 website (a PDF file).\n}}

{{Sponsored by the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the TEDMED organization, the challenges included The Obesity Crisis, Eliminating Medical Errors, End-of-Life Care, Impact of Poverty on Health, and Medical Information Overload.\nClick here for the full slate of candidates.\nThe list included some perennial Washington obsessions such as Addressing Health Care Costs, but did not include other DC favorites such as the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid and the future of Obamacare.\nThe soft-pedaling of politically touchy issues was in line with the wishes of the new curator of TEDMED, Jay Walker, who decided that the meeting would avoid contentious content during its first outing in DC. An inventor and the founder most famously of Priceline, Walker's company, Walker Digital, acquired TEDMED last year.\nNot everyone in the TEDMED community agreed, given that this is a political town and issues can be discussed without taking sides. Personally, I believe that a TED meets Washington airing of issues could be exciting. Walker, however, wanted to stay with the tradition of TED, which stands for Technology Entertainment & Design - but not politics.\nEach of the 50 challenges at TEDMED were represented by an \"advocate\" - entrepreneurs, physicians, hospital executives, patient representatives, and others. At the last minute, probably late at night, a challenge #51 was added to the list - Sleep Deprivation - hardly a shock at a meeting of over-achievers.\nSome of the advocates campaigned hard for their challenge, donning buttons and t-shirts and passing out cards and flyers.\nFor instance, one morning on a bus taking me to the meeting place at Kennedy Center, a personable young physician named Rajiv Kumar thrust out his hand and a card encouraging me to vote for his challenge - Inventing Wellness Programs that Work.\n\"70 percent of Americans don't exercise regularly,\" he explained, telling me he had co-founded a company in 2006 called ShapeUp. Based in Rhode Island, Kumar's business company is using data and the latest Health 2.0 tools to help other companies incentivize their employees to be more fit, to improve health and to save money.\nIn another nod to Washington, a few advocates enlisted the deeper pockets of well-healed sponsors such as the Cleveland Clinic. Their Chief Experience Officer, physician James Merlino, campaigned for Improving Medical Communication. His flyer quoted George Bernard Shaw: \"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\"\nAnd now, the envelope please.\nThe winner was: Inventing Wellness Programs that Work - Rajiv Kumar's challenge. This candidate brought in a staggering 10% of the vote, twice the percentage of the second place winner, which was The Caregiver Crisis, polling at 5%.\nThird place was a tie, with Role of the Patient polling the same as The Obesity Crisis, each getting 4% of the vote.\n}}

{{CITY HALL \u2014 Glendale\u2019s employee healthcare costs will increase by roughly 9% this summer, officials said Monday \u2014 bad news for a city that is bracing for a multi-million dollar budget deficit.\nThat increase, effective June 1, will add to the roughly $21.5 million that Glendale paid to cover employee healthcare costs last fiscal year, according to a city report.\nFinance Director Bob Elliot, who addressed the Audit Committee on Monday, said it was unclear how much of that 9% increase would be paid by the city, which negotiates employee contributions with each union.\nStill, the steeper tab adds to an estimated General Fund budget deficit of up to $15 million for next fiscal year, he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re going to face,\u201d Elliot said.\nWith three of the city's four employee unions set to negotiate new contracts this spring, some of the increased medical premiums likely will be covered by employees, he added.\n\u201cWe will be negotiating with all the groups,\u201d Elliot said. \u201cRates have gone up, but what the cost share is at this point remains to be negotiated.\u201d\nThe Glendale Fire Fighters Assn. is the only employee group without an expiring contract this year and will pay 50% of the increased medical costs.\nOn Monday, city critic Herbert Molano urged the audit commissioners to take a closer look at the city\u2019s budget woes, calling the tab for employee medical benefits \u201castronomical.\u201d\n\u201cI think that the Audit Committee should be looking at these major numbers to provide some sort of clarity or warning, or some other way of highlighting the problem,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to ballooning pension obligations and the $15 million projected budget gap, city officials will also have to wrestle with the absence of the annual transfer of millions in water revenues from Glendale Water & Power, which last stood at $4.2 million. The City Council halted the practice after city attorneys determined it could be ruled unconstitutional.\nPast budget-cutting sessions have resulted in the slashing of more than 100 city positions, with dozens more kept vacant in an ongoing hiring freeze, which has kept about 80 jobs vacant, saving the city between $4 and $6 million, Elliot said. But the City Council still will have make some tough budget decisions this spring.\nCity executives on Monday began a series of meetings to address potential departmental cutbacks, with a focus on prioritizing city services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a review in that perspective, with a mind toward trying to focus on what the essential services are,\u201d Elliot said.\nThe city could see additional financial distress if Gov. Jerry Brown succeeds with his plan to eliminate local redevelopment agencies, which in addition to generating tax revenue for major development projects, also cover a portion of some employee salaries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s another big issue that that gap does not incorporate,\u201d Elliot said. \u201cIt ultimately depends on what the state does, and we don\u2019t know where they\u2019re at yet.

{{Comparatively speaking the United States has the highest healthcare costs of all 34 countries in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. But, relative to the past five decades, healthcare inflation is practically at its low.\nAccording to data from the Commerce Department, healthcare costs for July 2013 rose just 1% over July 2012. To add some context to these figures, the year-over-year increase between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s ranged between 4% to as high as 12%.\nOpioid abuse is on the rise\nHowever, one treatment area where costs aren't declining for consumers and insurers is opioid prescriptions. Opioids are commonly prescribed to patients who are dealing with chronic pain issues. Because the condition is ongoing, there's a propensity for patients to be on these medications for long periods of time. Furthermore, many opioid-based medications, such as Oxycontin and Vicodin, can be quite addictive which can lead to abuse of the medication.\nAccording to a clinical review published by Dr. Kathryn Hahn of Oregon State University's College of Pharmacy in 2011, retail sales of hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone increased by 244%, 732%, and 1,177%, respectively, between 1997 and 2006. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health also estimated that 5.2 million people aged 12 and older had abused prescription opioids within the past month in a study conducted in 2007.\nOpioid abuse costs the healthcare system billions annually\nYet, this isn't just a problem for the abusers and their families. It's a strain on the healthcare system as a whole. Dr. Hahn's analysis shows that the average per-person healthcare cost to payer was $15,884 for opioid abusers compared to just $1,830 for those who didn't abuse opioids \u2013 more than eight times higher! These costs stem from higher emergency department and outpatient visits, a greater need for mental health evaluations and substance abuse treatment, and a much higher propensity to need treatment for comorbidities (i.e.,the presence of two more chronic diseases in a patient at the same time) which are considerably more expensive to treat in abusers compared to nonabusers.\nIn addition, insurers foot a big bill for so-called drug diversion, or the use of prescription drugs in a recreational manner. Based on data from 2008 in Dr. Hahn's review, drug diversion costs the health insurance industry a whopping $72.5 billion per year, of which nearly $25 billion affects the private insurance market.\nLong story short, the abuse of opioid medications in this country is turning into a financial black hole for the insurers that pay for these medications.\nAn unlikely solution\nBut, that could be about to change potentially thanks to, of all things, medical marijuana.\nAccording to an abstract published online this past week by JAMA Internal Medicine, the use of medical marijuana in states that have legalized the drug for prescription purposes have led to significantly lower opioid-overdose mortality rates.\nThe basis of the study was to look at all 50 U.S. states between 1999 and 2010, examine state-level death certificates to determine how many people had died from opioid-induced overdoses, and then compare those states which have legalized medical marijuana to the opioid-induced overdoses to determine if there were any discernable trends.\nTheir findings showed that states which had medical cannabis laws in place over this time period (13 states in total, 10 of which enacted medical marijuana laws between 1999 and 2010) had, \"a 24.8% lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with states without cannabis laws.\" In other words, when medical marijuana was an option for physicians to turn to, there were fewer opioid-abuse deaths.\nAs you can probably surmise by now, a nearly 25% reduction in opioid-induced mortality would likely translate into big savings for the healthcare system (although it's hard to know how much for sure, since the JAMA study didn't go into non-mortality specifics).\nPerhaps the most attractive component of this past week's abstract was that the trend toward lowered opioid-induced mortality tended to increase as time went on.\nIn the first year following medical marijuana approval on a state level the rate of opioid-induced overdoses that led to death dropped by 19.9%. By the sixth year following the passage of medical marijuana laws, this reduction had increased to 33.3%. Secondary analyses of these findings confirmed the initial study. Of course, it's important to note that the study's authors were quite clear about the fact that they do not yet know what the causal link is -- so more research is needed.\nOne big hurdle remains\nWhile it's possible studies like this one and many more might push additional states toward passing similar medical marijuana legislation \u2013 and it already has with 23 states and Washington D.C. now allowing medical marijuana to be prescribed by physicians, up from just 13 in 2010 \u2013 one key hurdle remains which could stymie this movement.\nSpecifically, marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug according to the federal government and the Drug Enforcement Agency. Thus far the move by individual states to legalize the use of cannabis within their respective states hasn't been hampered by the federal government which has largely kept its distance. However, the move by a select few states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, and recent plans by some marijuana plant growers to expand their operations beyond their own state's borders, will leave the federal government with some interesting choices. If the government's reaction isn't favorable, the expansion of medical marijuana to additional states could stall or stop altogether.\nRegardless of where you stand on this issue it remains a hot-button topic worth monitoring as it has the potential to drastically alter the healthcare treatment landscape.\n}}

{{Pharmacy student Eunice Wong believes that redefining the roles of pharmacists here is crucial to improving healthcare services.\nThe 23-year-old, who is in her fourth year at University College London, wrote in to the \"My Future SG\" contest to discuss what she had learnt during her placements in Britain's healthcare system.\nSaid Ms Wong in an interview: \"In the UK, pharmacists have greater responsibilities and are able to prescribe certain medicines. At present, if I am not wrong, pharmacists in Singapore are not able to do that yet.\"\nShe said her Singaporean friends had scoffed at her when she took up a Ministry of Health scholarship to study pharmacy. \"Their impression of a pharmacist was that of one who sat behind a desk at the polyclinics and dispensed medicine.\n\"Honestly, I was really offended. After being in London, it is obvious that people in the UK respect pharmacists a lot more .\n\"Most of the time, pharmacists are the first healthcare professionals people there will consult if they are feeling unwell - especially if it's just a minor ailment. This frees up the doctors to focus on patients that have more major ailments.\"\nIn her contest submission, she wrote that her experience with Britain's National Health Service (NHS) has led her to conclude that free healthcare is not ideal.\nShe wrote: \"It makes people selfish and inconsiderate, taking even their health for granted.\"\nIn the interview, she said under the NHS, queues are especially long and doctors are also more hesitant about prescribing medicine. \"People go to the doctors for all sorts of random reasons, taking up time and resources that could have been devoted to more genuine cases.\"\nMs Wong, who will return at the end of her studies to work at the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, said: \"I appreciate that the healthcare (system) in Singapore considers our ability to afford, catering for the poorer population with subsidies. This allows everyone to have equal access to healthcare without overtaxing the working population.\"\n}}

{{During the past eight weeks, officials and staff at a hospital in Ypsilanti have been feeling around in the dark, scrambling without the benefit of clinical guidelines or experience as they try to manage a virulent outbreak of an infection that had not been seen in humans.\nDue most likely to chance, the region surrounding 530-bed St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor has found itself at the center of a national outbreak of fungal meningitis that has so far infected 469 patients in 19 states, killing 33, according to the most recent federal data. The infections have been traced to contaminated lots of injectable steroids, distributed by the Framingham, Mass.-based New England Compounding Center.\nSt. Joseph has treated 123 patients with the disease, 73 of whom are currently hospitalized and five of whom have died, officials said. The hospital has cared for about 85 percent of the total number of fungal meningitis cases seen in Michigan thus far.\n\"Twenty-five percent of the cases in the country are sitting in one hospital,\" said Rob Casalou, St. Joseph's president and CEO.\nThe surge of new patients and the unprecedented nature of their illness have turned St. Joseph into a learning laboratory, as the hospital collaborates with its parent health system, other local providers and federal health officials to track the outbreak, identify treatments and manage complications.\nAll of St. Joseph's fungal meningitis patients received steroid injections at Michigan Pain Specialists in Brighton, a physician-owned pain clinic roughly 26 miles from the hospital. Michigan Pain Specialists was one of four clinics in Michigan to receive contaminated shipments of steroids, Casalou said, and the lot that arrived in the Brighton area seems to have been more highly contaminated than others.\n\"The clinic received one of the 'hot lots,' \" Casalou said, using a term that has been used to describe lots of the drug that have been linked to large numbers of infections. \"Some of the lots had higher concentrations than others.\"\nAbout 620 patients received a total of about 750 contaminated steroid injections at Michigan Pain Specialists, according to figures cited by the hospital.\nIn the first week of October, just after Tennessee health officials first reported a cluster of fungal meningitis cases, St. Joseph began to identify patients with the disease, said Dr. Lakshmi Halasymani, the hospital's chief medical officer.\nAs the hospital quickly became known as one of the few that had some degree of familiarity with the infection, St. Joseph officials decided to gather and treat all affected patients from the region at their facility.\n\"It became clear very early on that this population was going to need very consistent care delivery and care management,\" Halasymani said. \"We're dealing with a period of real clinical uncertainty, and it helped to have a centralized approach.\"\nAs part of becoming the region's go-to facility for the outbreak, St. Joseph initiated its emergency preparedness plan, which allowed it to increase staffing levels and more easily coordinate with other hospitals in the region, Casalou said. The incident command center has now been operational for nearly two months. \"Disasters usually have a defined time period, and we quickly realized we were going from a sprint to marathon,\" he added.\nIn the rush to prepare the hospital for the influx of serious, high-acuity patients, St. Joseph's opened 16 additional beds that were at the time licensed but offline. Those beds were opened in less than a week, Casalou said.\nTrinity Health, St. Joseph's parent health system, stepped in, too. The Livonia-based system sent nurses from multiple locations, including its hospitals in Pontiac and Columbus, Ohio.\nState officials granted licenses to out-of-state nurses in just 24 hours, Casalou said. They also approved an emergency certificate of need for an additional MRI machine and granted a license request for another operating room in just one day.\nTo ensure treatments that were deemed effective were put into practice right away, Trinity helped to build order sets for the health system's electronic health record that corresponded with protocols identified by St. Joseph clinicians and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Dr. Donald Bignotti, Trinity Health's senior vice president and chief medical officer. \"We now have evidence-based treatments,\" he said.\nTrinity also added clinical decision-support alerts into the EHR that help physicians identify which patients are at risk of fungal meningitis.\nAnd the health system is poised to assist with supply-chain gaps, preparing to move additional shipments of anti-fungals if probable drug shortages occur, Bignotti said.\n\"The other area that we think is really important is advocacy in Washington,\" he said. \"We're trying to raise awareness about what the patients and St. Joseph are going through.\"\nFor instance, before last week's congressional hearings on the outbreak, Trinity officials spoke with Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who attended the hearings, and provided him information about experiences at St. Joseph and about an impending drug shortage.\nIn particular, Bignotti said, Trinity is trying to make sure St. Joseph is not penalized for failing to meet certain targets on quality metrics, such as readmissions. More than 30 percent of the patients who have received treatment for fungal meningitis at St. Joseph have been readmitted to the hospital, many because of spinal abscesses at their injection sites, a recently identified and serious complication.\nAlso, patients may incur thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs because they need to be on expensive drugs for long periods of time, Casalou said, adding that there will be \"huge financial ramifications for patients and hospitals.\"\n\"We're at the tip of the spear when it comes to not only the clinical but the operational aspects of this disease,\" Casalou said. \"We are having conversations with payers, and we will have conversations with CMS because this is clearly outside of the parameters of anything we have ever seen. I have a lot of faith that they will look at this differently.\"\nFor now, the focus is on the ongoing management of patients' infections. As more patients are readmitted with abscesses and fluid collections, the problem is shifting from a medical disease that is treated with anti-fungals to one that requires surgery and antibiotics, Halasymani said.\nSome of the readmitted patients have no symptoms, and their abscesses were identified only after multiple MRI scans, highlighting the complex and slow-moving nature of the infection, she added.\nTo accommodate the needs of patients after discharge, St. Joseph opened a fungal-outbreak clinic in an ambulatory facility on its campus staffed with volunteer infectious-disease specialists and clinicians from St. Joseph and other Trinity Health facilities. The clinic sees patients on an outpatient basis, coordinating their care and monitoring them for any new signs of illness.\n\"Having the patient as our core focus throughout this process has really allowed us to be very nimble,\" Halasymani said. \"I think we've mobilized the best aspects of our organization.\"\nThe hospital has been in regular contact with officials at the CDC as the agency tries to facilitate communication among hospitals and identify which treatments are working best.\nWhile the CDC usually works with state health departments, the nature of this outbreak made it necessary to communicate directly with hospitals, said Dr. Tom Chiller, a medical epidemiologist and deputy chief of the CDC's mycotic diseases branch.\n\"St. Joseph has been instrumental in helping to understand how this problem is evolving and how to manage it,\" Chiller said.\nDespite the gains of the past two months, there are still more questions than answers, he said. For instance, he rejected the notion of \"hot lots,\" arguing that the large number of infected patients could have been a result of differences in vial size, the age of the drug or the number of injections patients received. \"We just don't know,\" Chiller said.\nIt's also unclear, said Casalou, St. Joseph's CEO, how long it will be before the outbreak begins to taper off.\n\"At some point \u2014 we don't know when \u2014 this will start to wane,\" he said. \"We thought it would have happened by now, but then these readmissions started. We're just not sure now.\"\nFrom Modern Healthcare\n}}

{{Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) Barclays Global Healthcare Conference March 12, 2019 9:00 AM ET\nCompany Participants\nKaren Parkhill - EVP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nConference Call Participants\nKristen Stewart - Barclays Bank\nKristen Stewart\nAll right. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining me for this session of Barclays Global Healthcare Conference. I'm Kristen Stewart, the Medical Supplies and Devices Analyst. With me today, it's my pleasure to have Medtronic, the CFO of the company, Karen Parkhill, with us today. So Karen, I want to just kind of kick off this session just asking a question. That's what do you think is the most underappreciated aspect of Medtronic from an investor perspective? What do you think kind of people are really missing there?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nA - Karen Parkhill\nWell, thanks, Kristen. Is my mic on? There we go.\nKristen Stewart\nYes.\nKaren Parkhill\nHopefully, all of you who have heard us talk about our really exciting pipeline. And we are so excited about this pipeline. We firmly believe it's the strongest pipeline we've ever had in our company's history. And when we look at the strength of our pipeline, it's across all of our groups. And it's not just -- we talked about the pipeline starting to kick in, in the back half of FY '20, but it's beyond that into our long-range plan. If we think about some of the great things in our CVG business, for example, we've got the Micra AV coming toward the end of next year. And the Micra AV is our -- the smallest pacemaker out there on the market. And currently, the Micra addresses about 15% of the pacing market today. When we are able to launch the Micra AV, it will address more than 50% of the pacing market. And this pacemaker is one-of-a-kind. It's a tiny pacemaker that's inserted through a catheter and it reduces the rate of infection because of how it's inserted, and we get 3x the reimbursement from CMS. [I know my mic keeps going in and out. We need to switch mic].\nKristen Stewart\nApologies from the webcast for the technical difficulties.\nKaren Parkhill\nThank you. Okay. Oh, this will do. Okay, better mic. Okay, so the Micra AV, truly one of its kind smallest pacemaker out there, will address over 50% of the market when we're able to launch it. We get 3x the reimbursement from CMS on this before when we're able to address more than 50% as opposed to just 15% that we have today. That will be very large for us, and we're really excited about it. Longer term in our CVG business, we're really excited about the Ardian trial and work that we got going on to use renal renovation to address the hypertension market. If we look at our MITG business, we're really excited about launching our surgical robot this coming fiscal year. We believe that this will be a very competitive robot. And we'll use the strength of our surgical training centers around the world.\nThe fact that we train more surgeons than anyone around the world today to train on that platform and to ultimately launch it. And we're learning a lot right now about the launch of our Mazor spinal robot and how we can take what we've learned with the Mazor spinal robot that's paired with the Core Spine implant to do the same with our surgical robot, our general surgical robot, that will be paired with our end effectors, which are the consumable piece of that business. So very excited about that launch within RTG. We're really excited about what's going on across many of our businesses. But I'd note our Neurovascular business and the fact that we're going to be focused on the DBS primary cell with Bluetooth capabilities soon. And then as we look longer term, closed-loop DBS and the cranial-mounted DBS system. And then in our Diabetes business, we obviously are taking our 670G, the first closed-loop system in the market outside the United States right now. And we'll be doing that through next fiscal year.\nAnd we're investing heavily around an advanced hybrid closed-loop system, which will have Bluetooth capability and advanced algorithms to keep blood glucose in range 80% of the time. And then we're focused beyond the advanced hybrid closed loop on investing heavily in the personalized closed-loop system, which is a system that will be the true artificial pancreas where patients won't have to focus on carb counting and knowing how exercise and insulin affects their body, that it will have personalized algorithms to be able to understand all that for each patient. So really excited about our pipeline, Kristen. Really excited about our improvement on free cash flow. Hopefully, investors have noticed the significant improvement we've made this fiscal year on free cash flow. We're going to continue that. And then we're also focused on our ROIC, too. We have been under the target that we have been focused on our ROIC since our merger with Covidien, and we're getting closer to the target every year and we're very focused on getting it to that target and above.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And I'd like to bring up one of the audience response questions. So you guys can see the little devices in front of you here. The first question that we'll have is around the organic sales growth rate of the company.\nIf you could just respond to what you view to be the sustainable organic sales growth rate for the next three years for Medtronic, ranging from 2% and under to 8% and above? Please start the clock. [Voting]\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And so Karen, it seems like everybody is pretty well aligned, I guess, in terms of the LRP. Maybe just walk us through your impression of these results. And I'm interested in those who also put greater than 8%, that's interesting. But how do you just feel about these and just kind of thinking about the broader medtech markets that are probably going around that 4% to 5%? And you talked a lot about these new products that you have across multiple divisions. So should we think about 4% of your LRP as the baseline and obviously, the aspirations are to do much better than that? How should we put the LRP into context?\nKaren Parkhill\nThanks for the question, Kristen. I think you put it well, and I think it shows on these results. When we gave our long-range outlook last Investor Day, we were focused on giving an outlook that we were highly confident that we could meet and exceed. And that's why we had 4% plus on our long-range revenue growth outlook. And so we're very confident in our ability to deliver that 4% plus. And yes, you can think about the 4% as a floor on an annual basis. And our pipeline, depending on when we launched certain key products, we have a great ability to reach well above that 4% at different points in time. But long-range sustainable is where we would focus on the 4% plus.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And just to talk about one of the areas in particular within diabetes that should be a division that grows in excess of the overall LRP plan. I guess, how confident are you in the sustainability of that growth? And do you expect to see maybe lower volatility to the extent you seeing greater sales within the CGM franchise and whatnot? How should we just think about diabetes longer term?\nKaren Parkhill\nYes, yes. So diabetes is one that we expect to grow greater than the corporate average over the long-range plan on an annual basis, and we're confident in that. In terms of diabetes, now that we've launched our closed-loop system, the 670G that's paired with the sensor technology, it's not just the reservoirs and the tubings that are the consumables on our installed base, but now we have the sensors as a consumable on our installed base. And as we grow that installed base, that annuity revenue will accrue. And so the business model there has been changing to be more annuity revenue than just one-off pump sales. And so I think in terms of diabetes, you should think about that similar to our other groups. When we have significant product launches, you'll see some spikes in revenue growth, but that annuity base is a very strong base.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And then I want to talk a little bit about the operating margin profile of the company. I'll bring up the next audience response question as well. You guys have a goal of improving operating margins 40% to 50% or 40 basis points each year. I want to get the audience's view in terms of what they believe the achievability of this forecast is, whether it's too aggressive or reasonable or very conservative. We'll start the response time now. [Voting]\nKristen Stewart\nI'm getting it. It's 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion each year. And very well show that you can, for the most part, do it, 52% reasonable. Some in the room say it's a little aggressive. So maybe just talk through how you view this to be. I know that the operational excellence program is something you initiated last year and you're driving a lot of these efforts on the margin front. So how do you feel confident about this 40 to 50 basis point number?\nKaren Parkhill\nWe feel confident about it. And if you think about moving from 4% plus revenue growth to 40 to 50 basis points operating margin, you need at least that operating margin, plus financial leverage, to get to the 8% over the long-range plan. And there are some years that we'll have stronger revenue growth. But we are focused on driving this operating margin expansion through our Enterprise Excellence Program. We're still in the earlier stages. We've seen great results and traction so far. And that Enterprise Excellence Program is specifically designed to drive margin improvement and to drive greater margin improvement to enable more reinvestments in our company. So in R&D, in large product launches, and marketing, that reinvestment is really important as we think about the strength of our pipeline and bringing those products to market. So the enterprise excellence goal is designed to do just that. We have been focused on operations consolidation through consolidating plants and distribution centers and becoming more efficient on the operations side. We've been focused on functional optimization and excellence, where we're driving greater use of shared services and Centers of Excellence across our global function to become more efficient. And we've been focused on commercial optimization where we're focused on looking at parts of our back office and our go-to-market strategy and where can we drive greater efficiency on the commercial side as well. And so we're seeing strong traction and you're seeing the results.\nKaren Parkhill\nAnd one of the things, I guess, that has been of recent focus is obviously the fiscal '20 outlook. You've commented earlier this year that you're going to see a little bit of a higher tax rate and that, that is going to prompt maybe EPS growth to be a little bit below that 8% target that you had. You recently just completed a very large debt transaction. Can you maybe just speak to how the investment community should view that in terms of offsetting some of the headwind of the tax? Does it make you more comfortable in just achieving the consensus numbers that are out there? Just maybe put that into context for people.\nKaren Parkhill\nYes. No, thanks for the question, Kristen. And as always, we'll give our fiscal year '20 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May. But we have signaled that we are facing a higher tax rate next year from tax reform. So this fiscal year, we're likely to end the year with a tax rate of around 14%. And next year, we're looking at a tax rate between 16% and 17%. So a decent one-time step up in our tax rate. We will be focused on tax planning everywhere we can. We have been planning, and our tax rate will be higher than 16% to 17% if we haven't done some planning already. So it is something that we are focused on. We will do. But at this stage, we're looking at the 16% to 17%. And we're pleased that we had a very successful year at that offering and tender over the last week. And that was specifically designed to help offset the tax rate increase that we're facing next year. And so we were pleased with that outcome. At this point, The Street was already anticipating a decent amount of interest savings next year and so we're comfortable with street consensus right now where you are for FY '20.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. So in other words, this doesn't completely offset the tax saving -- the higher rate, I guess, but it helps to mitigate what otherwise could be a greater flow through the bottom line a little bit more?\nKaren Parkhill\nYes, well said, well said. And if you think about it, you need this margin expansion plus financial leverage to typically get to our 8%. What we've done is we've offset the negative financial leverage for next year, but we just may not have positive financial leverage.\nKristen Stewart\nRight, okay. And I want to talk a little bit about just the free cash flow generation that occurs at Medtronic. That's been an area where you've done a lot of improvements over the last couple of years. And with that, I want to do the last audience response question here on capital deployment. If you could bring up the question, please? Where do you see the greatest opportunity to create shareholder value? The audience has choices from increased R&D, emerging markets, tuck-in acquisitions, larger M&A, repayment of debt share purchase and breaking up the company as well. Please start the countdown there. [Voting]\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. Well, the time run out there. And Karen, maybe while it's counting down, can you just talk about the improvements that you've had in cash flow over the last couple of years?\nKaren Parkhill\nYes. So we've had really strong improvements. It's been a concerted focus for the entire company. It now is 1\/3 of our incentive comps for the entire company, and you've seen it in our results. This year, we're tracking to be well ahead of last year in terms of free cash flow. And we recently increased the guidance for the year of our free cash flow from $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion, to $5 billion to $5.2 billion. So we've seen great focus on cash flow. In terms of our use of capital, we're focused on continuing to generate strong free cash flow and deliver greater than 50% of that to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. We have a strong dividend. It's in line with our peers. We intend to continue to grow that as we grow with the company. And then share repurchases and tuck-in M&A are things that we will do. We don't intend to hoard cash on our balance sheet. So we will be disciplined about tuck-in M&A, as we've done over the last several years. We'll continue to find great opportunities to help supplement our own R&D portfolio that are designed to ultimately be accretive to our growth and our margins. And then when we don't have the opportunities for the right M&A and tuck-in and bolt-ons, we'll be return to more to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase.\nKristen Stewart\nAnd then what would you say, for the webcast purposes, the response to the various things? We had 27% of people who are good for tuck-in or bolt-on acquisitions and an equal amount who thinks that the company is too big and would argue that there's value in breaking it up. How would you address kind of just of the size of Medtronic, either the acquisition of Covidien significantly increased the size of the company, the breadth of the portfolio, and that's definitely been, I guess, has that been additive, I guess, in your view in hindsight now. Just how do you think about that from a management perspective?\nKaren Parkhill\nYes. So I would say the Covidien transaction has absolutely been additive to the company. If you just look at the value that we've driven to shareholders through that acquisition, it's clear. We also have seamlessly integrated that acquisition and there have been clear synergies through cross-sell across the company, through taking best practices in one area of the company and moving it to another through leveraging the size and scale and strength of Medtronic and things like clinical trials and things like R&D, and in things like manufacturing excellence. So there is clearly a benefit to having all of these businesses together. Should there ever not be that benefit, we would clearly focus on doing the right thing for our shareholders as evidenced by a very large divestiture that we did a couple of years ago when we sold a large portion of our patient monitoring business to Cardinal Health. So we do portfolio management. We do focus on doing the right thing for our shareholders. And at this stage, we see great benefit from our businesses benefiting from each other.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And then just to kind of circle back kind of on FY '20. You guys have talked a little bit about kind of tail of this year, fourth quarter being kind of the low watermark. It sounds like in 2020, growth should start really accelerating and then the pipeline should start kicking in more meaningful. How should we just think about kind of cadence for the year? And then -- and maybe some of the timing for things like Micra and some of the other programs that you have out there that you're pretty excited about.\nKaren Parkhill\nYes, yes. Agreed, Kristen, that we're -- we've talked about this fourth quarter as being our low point. And in FY '20, we're focused on delivering that 4% plus for the year. Our pipeline is back-half loaded and back-end loaded in FY '20. So as we look ahead, we should see accelerating growth throughout the year.\nKristen Stewart\nAnd to the extent that you are able to outperform on that, that 4% rate. And it sounds like you have a high level of confidence in the 40 to 50, what do you think that you'd be able to see that drop through to see better than 8% growth as we're looking out to 2021 and 2022? Because it seems like you've got the levers to drive significant, perhaps, upside to that 4% if everything kind of goes right.\nKaren Parkhill\nYes. So when we think about the bottom line growth, we talked about 8% over the long range plan at our Investor Day, and we said that there could be some years where we might be a little bit underneath the 8% because of one-time events. We talked about foreign exchange as a potential event there at the Investor Day. And as we look right now, we're facing a tax rate increase, which is nonoperational one-time. And so there could be years under 8%, but that -- but if we're getting to 8% over the long range, there's got to be years above the 8%. And if you look at this year alone, we're tracking to be well ahead of the 8% this current fiscal year.\nKristen Stewart\nOkay. And then, I guess, just in the last couple of minutes left, what would be the one thing that you want people to kind of walk away from this presentation feeling? Is it the conviction in the pipeline? Is it the conviction in management doing the right things from a cash flow deployment? Sure, maybe it's kind of everything. But what would be the one thing that you want to kind of really convey to the audience?\nKaren Parkhill\nYes. I would say, obviously, our pipeline is, I mentioned at the onset, the strongest that we've ever had in our history, and we are really excited about this pipeline. But I would say beyond the pipeline, we are focused on driving to be a world-class company. And we're focused on driving to consistent executions. We're focused on driving to continued operating margin expansion, getting our free cash flow to a conversion above 80% and driving long-term value for this company, and that's what world-class companies do. That's what we are focused on.\nKristen Stewart\nAll right. With that, I think that we will wrap this up. We are going to have a breakout session just down the hall. So I hope everyone can join us for that. Thanks, everyone, for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you, Karen.\nKaren Parkhill\nThank you.\n}}

{{The Senate is preparing for a debate of mammoth proportions after this Thanksgiving holiday. The Senate voted on Saturday to debate the bill by a 60-39 vote, despite strong opposition from some leaders, mainly Republican. As previously reported, the Health Care reform bill already passed in the House of Representatives, skimming by on a vote of 220-215.\nNow that the bill\u2019s reached the Senate, a heated debate is expected.\nAccording to The Associated Press, the bill would extend coverage to roughly 31 million people, crack down on insurance company practices that deny or dilute benefits and cut down spending on medical care nationwide.\nIn the final minutes of Saturday\u2019s daylong session, Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of trying to stifle a historic debate the nation needed.\nThe Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the vote was anything but procedural \u2014 casting it as a referendum on the bill itself, which he said would raise taxes, cut Medicare and create a \u201cmassive and unsustainable debt.\u201d\nOn Sunday, moderate Senate Democrats threatened to scuttle health-care legislation if their demands aren\u2019t met, while more liberal members warned their party leaders not to bend.\nThis could get ugly. Look for more coverage on President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform bill when the debate begins after the holiday.\n}}

{{9.15am BST\nClare Horton writes\nGood morning and welcome to the daily live blog from the Guardian Healthcare Professionals Network. Throughout the day, we'll be bringing you news, comment and analysis from around the web.\nThe Guardian reports today that a report from the UK's emergency doctors calls for GP surgeries to be set up at hospitals to ease the growing pressure on accident and emergency units, which are struggling to cope with an \"unsustainable\" increase in patients. Health correspondent Denis Campbell writes:\nFamily doctors, as well as nurses and specialists in looking after frail elderly people, need to assess and treat as many as 30% of the patients arriving at hospital and keep them away from the casualty departments, according to the College of Emergency Medicine (CEM), which represents the NHS's 4,000 A&E doctors. A report by the college, based on a survey of conditions at 131 of the UK's 248 A&E units, calls for a major overhaul of how emergency care is delivered. It urges a big expansion of what it calls \"co-located primary care services\" \u2013 especially GP services and urgent care centres \u2013 to look after between 15% and 30% of those arriving as emergency cases.\nThere's also news that doctors are to be set a target to diagnose another 160,000 dementia sufferers in a government drive to tackle the incurable brain condition.\nElsewhere, the Telegraph has a different line on the College of Emergency Medicine report, and says one in five accident and emergency units relies entirely on junior doctors at evenings and weekends.\nThe Independent says David Cameron plans to use Britain\u2019s presidency of the G8 leading industrialised nations to spearhead a new international drive to boost dementia research.\nAnd the BBC reports that measles cases in the Swansea epidemic have risen by 20 in the last five days to 1,094 as health chiefs warn the uptake of MMR is too low to eliminate the disease in Wales.\nIf there's a story, report or event you'd like to highlight \u2013 or you would like to share your thoughts on any of the healthcare issues in the news today \u2013 you can get in touch by leaving a comment below the line or tweeting us at @GdnHealthcare.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON - Four Republican senators from the conservative wing of their party say they oppose the Senate health-care bill as it was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday, which places the effort to overhaul the American health-care system in jeopardy as it heads for an anticipated vote in the Senate next week.\nThose senators - Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah - released a statement stating that while they cannot support the bill as its currently written, they are open to negotiating changes that could ultimately win their support.\n\"Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor,\" the statement read. \"There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current healthcare system but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their healthcare costs.\"\nTheir opposition is enough to place the GOP measure in serious jeopardy as McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans and still pass the measure. The bill is being moved under arcane budget rules that allows it to be passed with a simple majority or 50 votes, if Vice President Mike Pence is relied on as a tiebreaker.\n\"The current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people. I will oppose it coming to the floor in its current form, but I remain open to negotiations,\" said Paul.\nMcConnell introduced draft text - crafted behind closed doors among a small circle of lawmakers and aides -- of the Senate GOP bill in a private meeting with Republican senators on Thursday morning.\nInitial signs indicated the bill could be in trouble if the Kentucky Republican intends to subject it to a vote before lawmakers leave Washington for the July 4 recess. According to two Republicans in close contact with Senate GOP leadership granted anonymity to describe private conversations, McConnell is threatening to bring the bill to a vote next week even if he doesn't have the necessary votes.\nBut some believe that message is aimed at trying to pressure Republicans to support the bill rather than an absolute commitment - and that the majority leader would end the push if he doesn't have the votes. A McConnell spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\"Right now the challenge is how we get to 50,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., a top McConnell deputy, referring to the number of senators needed to pass the bill, with Vice President Pence standing ready to cast a tiebreaking vote.\nNo Democrats are expected to support the measure, which dramatically scales back the 2010 Affordable Care Act that was President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement and helped ensure coverage for roughly 20 million Americans through a combination of Medicaid coverage and subsidized private plans.\nOne potentially ominous sign for leadership was the reaction of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, R, who is up for reelection in 2018. Heller released a statement saying he has \"serious concerns\" about the bill's Medicaid provisions.\nThe 142-page bill would curtail federal Medicaid funding, repeal taxes on the wealthy and eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood as part of an effort to fulfill a seven-year promise to undo Barack Obama's signature health-care law.\nIt abolishes two of the law's central mandates - that individuals must show proof of insurance when filing their taxes, and that firms with 50 workers or more must provide health coverage - while providing less money for moderate and low-income Americans buying insurance on the individual market.\nThe bill is an attempt to strike a compromise between the ACA and a measure passed by the GOP-controlled House in May. The Senate proposal largely mirrors the measure that passed the House - with some significant differences.\n\"Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act - and we are,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in on speech on the Senate floor. He underscored the taxes and regulations in the ACA that the GOP measure would repeal.\nSenate Democrats swiftly protested the bill, criticizing Republicans for crafting it under very secretive conditions and asking for more time to debate and vet the measure than McConnell plans to allow. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans were \"turning truth upside down\" with their promises of an open amendment process next week.\nBut McConnell faces the prospect of an open revolt from key conservative and moderate GOP senators, whose concerns he has struggled to balance in recent weeks. Senate leaders have more work to do to secure the votes needed to pass the measure, Republicans familiar with the effort said.\nMany GOPers reserved judgment on the measure as they exited McConnell's private presentation. In the days leading up to the bill's release, some Republicans have intensified their complaints about the substance of the emerging bill and the tightly controlled process under which McConnell and only a small handful of aides wrote it.\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said the mood in the room made for an \"interesting morning, a little tense.\" He was one of several Republicans who pushed for the Senate measure to be \"more gracious\" than the House bill, an aim he feels was satisfied. But Scott predicted there was \"a long way to go\" before concluding whether it could pass.\nSenate leaders plan to move the bill to the floor after receiving an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which said Thursday it will do \"early next week.\" The CBO is expected to release a comprehensive estimate of how many people are expected to lose coverage as a result of the bill and how much it is expected to cost.\nThe CBO concluded the House bill would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 than under current law, while also concluding that premiums would drop overall.\nLike the House bill, the Senate measure would make big changes to Medicaid that in effect would reduce federal spending on the program. The Senate measure would cut off expanded Medicaid funding for states more gradually than the House bill by phasing out the higher federal match between 2020 and 2024, but would enact deeper long-term cuts to a program that ]provides health care coverage for 74 million Americans.\nIt also would eliminate House language aimed at prohibiting federally subsidized health plans from covering abortions, a provision that may run afoul of complex Senate budget rules.\nWhile the House legislation would peg federal insurance subsidies to consumers' age, the Senate bill would factor in income as well,as the ACA does. But younger people would still get more generous subsidies than they do under current law.\nThe measure would preserve two of the ACA's most-popular provisions: insurers could not deny coverage based on preexisting conditions and children may stay on their parents' plans until the age of 26. Insurers must set prices based on the overall insurance pool rather than charging sicker Americans more.\nBut the bill would allow states to use an existing ACA program, known as 1332, for states to file waivers with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to scale back what sort of plans insurers offer. Through these waivers states could eliminate elements of the ACA's essential health benefits package, which includes preventive and maternity as well as newborn care, along with substance abuse and mental-health treatment. Such changes would make plans cheaper, though they could lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses for consumers.\nInsurance subsidies are currently available to Americans earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Starting in 2020, that threshold would be lowered to 350 percent under the Senate bill - but anyone below that line could get the subsidies if they're not eligible for Medicaid.\nIn a move that will please the health-care industry, the Senate bill also proposes repealing all the ACA taxes except for its \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost health plans in language similar to the House version. Senators had previously toyed with the idea of keeping some of the ACA's taxes.\nIt would also eliminate Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood for one year. Federal law already prevents taxpayer funding to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother or in the case of rape or incest. But some Republicans want to ban all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which also provides health services such as birth control and preventive screening.\nIn a move that is critical to insurers, the Senate measure would continue to fund for two years cost-sharing subsidies that help 7 million Americans with ACA plans. House Republicans have challenged the legality of the $7 billion in subsidies - which help cover consumers' deductibles and copays - in court, and insurers warned they would have to increase premiums dramatically next year unless the federal government commits to continuing the payments.\nOutside criticism of the GOP effort has been mounting. The heads of 10 managed care organizations penned a letter to McConnell and Schumer this week saying they were \"united in our opposition to the Medicaid policies currently being debated by the Senate.\"\n}}

{{Members of local advocacy group Charlottesville For Reasonable Health Insurance provided testimony at the Virginia General Assembly and organized an email campaign, helping to ensure passage of a critical Virginia healthcare bill that will offer some in the area relief from this year\u2019s health insurance premium crisis. Introduced by VA Sen. Creigh Deeds, SB672 will allow self-employed people to take advantage of the much more affordable health plans in the small group business marketplace, without having to hire employees.\nCharlottesville and surrounding counties (Albemarle, Green, Fluvanna and Nelson) have by far the most expensive health care premiums in the nation in 2018. Rates more than tripled for consumers buying coverage on the ACA Individual Exchange, making comprehensive insurance unaffordable for people who do not qualify for subsidy assistance. A typical family of four is being charged $3000 per month for high deductible plans.\n\u201cI am very pleased with the passage of SB 672.\u201d said Shawn Cossette, who made numerous trips to Richmond to lobby for the bill. \u201cThese small group policies are ACA compliant covering preexisting conditions and preventative care, which I feel is as important as being affordable.\u201d\nWithout alternatives to the outrageous rates being imposed by Sentara\u2019s Optima Health monopoly, hundreds of individuals and families face financial hardship to buy health coverage that was affordable in 2017. Many are going uninsured or making significant compromises on the quality of coverage.\nLike this: Like Loading...\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n}}

{{Malaysia\u2019s IHH Healthcare Berhad is likely to pick up at least a 51% stake in struggling hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd for Rs 4,700-5,400 crore, the Mint newspaper reported.\nCiting two people aware of the bid details, the report said that IHH Healthcare\u2019s offer is more than that of TPG-backed Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.\nThe report said IHH had agreed to make an open offer at a premium to the average market price. It will first buy an around 25% stake in Fortis and will then make an open offer to buy an additional 26% stake.\nIn another report, Mint said that Indian agrochemical major UPL Ltd may acquire Arysta LifeScience, the agricultural pesticides business of NYSE-listed Platform Specialty Products Corp., for more than $4 billion.\nCiting three people aware of the development, the report said UPL is raising funds from a consortium of lenders to finance this deal.\nArysta LifeScience focuses on the development, formulation, registration, marketing and distribution of crop protection products for specialty applications, including seed treatments and biosolutions. The company employs about 3,300 people in 60 countries and recorded revenue of $1.9 billion in 2017.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that UPL had joined hands with sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and other investors in a bid to acquire Arysta LifeScience.\nSeparately, private equity firms Carlyle Group, Advent International and China\u2019s Fosun International are in talks to acquire a significant stake in Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business, Mint said in another report.\nCiting two people aware of the development, the report said that the value of the deal is estimated to be around Rs 1,500 crore or more. Avendus Capital has the mandate to find a buyer, the report added.\nIn May, Glenmark said it had appointed a committee to assess the feasibility of housing the API and consumer care businesses of the company into separate business entities.\nMeanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has clarified that the sponsors and managers of alternative investment funds are covered under its AIF regulations rather than the foreign direct investment rules, The Economic Times reported.\nIn April, the finance ministry said in a notification the minimum foreign direct investment for an unregulated fund-based service was $20 million.\nThe report said that SEBI last month clarified that sponsors and managers of AIFs won't have to abide by the $20 million limit.\n}}

{{How Google+ Could Transform Healthcare & Medicine\nOpinion\nXconomy National \u2014\nThis post was co-authored by Rich Whalley, an associate at CBT Advisors.\nWhat could Google do if it had access to everyone\u2019s health data?\nYou\u2019re probably already thinking a few things:\n1. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m giving Google my personal health data.\n2. Didn\u2019t Google already try to do this with Google Health?\n3. Won\u2019t this take the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d out of Google\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d motto?\nBut bear with us. Imagine a healthcare system 10 years in the future that would make Obama proud.\nI go to the doctor and find out that I\u2019m at risk for developing type II diabetes and need to craft an effective set of measures to minimize my risk. I find out that there are multiple recommended approaches, including preventative medicines. We log in to my Google+ health data page and go through the extensive record of my diet, lifestyle, and exercise data, as well as my genome. From this, we determine how my response is likely to compare to that of the average person at risk for diabetes.\nEven if Obamacare is ultimately upheld, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the government alone is capable of unifying and analyzing all this data through the implementation of electronic health records. A better solution may come from the private sector, where all the necessary tools are already developed. As we know from Wikipedia, the most comprehensive, cost-effective data sets often come from user-generated data.\nIn comparison to Wikipedia, and Google+, Google Health was never positioned to gain a large enough user base. Google Health also lacked the right social tools to become popular enough to generate anything like \u201cbig data.\u201d Google+, by contrast, will likely gain mass adoption because of the Gmail user-base and Google\u2019s recent moves in the smart phone space. Google\u2019s core strengths\u2014aggregate data analytics, Web app and smartphone integration\u2014give it the inside track to become the ultimate user-generated health resource.\nBut how to proceed? Letting it grow organically might ultimately lead to a flop the way it did with Google Health. Instead, we have a few suggestions to take on and neutralize the privacy issue and grow via a clever acquisition. That way, Google can realize its full potential as a neutral data gatherer and let its users benefit from the analysis\n1. Take the \u201cevil\u201d out of data acquisition\nGoogle has been in trouble in the past with privacy, and some view Google as an evil entity trying to take over the world by gaining and analyzing information on its users.

{{New tools to improve access to healthcare services for Africa's worst-off\nTo assist them, a team of researchers from the University of Montreal, with support from the international NGO HELP (Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe e.V.), has produced a thorough compilation of all existing knowledge on this subject, in four bilingual policy briefs. These briefs, which will be distributed as of November 2009 in Burkina Faso, are available at no charge on our Web site. Information is power, especially when it comes to defining health policy. Decision-makers need to have access to all the information and experience that can help them to implement the best strategies in their countries. The current situation\nSince the 1980s, nearly all African countries have implemented user fees in the hope of renewing their healthcare systems. Today, it is clear that this payment system excludes the most vulnerable and in fact puts them at risk of further impoverishment. Yet, there are other options besides user fees that have been the subject of documented studies. The problem is that their results are fragmented and often written in English, whereas most African decision-makers are francophone.\nSolutions are possible!\nThis was an intensive project for the University of Montreal researchers. These four bilingual policy briefs present four options that have been shown to promote access to care : abolition of user fees for healthcare services, case-by-case exemptions for the worst-off, health equity funds, and health insurance that includes coverage for the poor. The objective of this project? To give leaders a comprehensive overview of actions that have already been undertaken to evaluate what options are best suited to their context.\nMade for Africa, with Africa\nWith the assistance of an international NGO (HELP \u2013 Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe e.V.), consultations were carried out in Burkina Faso to strengthen the relevance of these policy briefs. Starting in November, these four documents will be distributed in Burkina Faso as part of a HELP project that will test a trial of user fees abolition.

{{The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 06\/30\/2015 settlement date, which shows a 630,647 share decrease in total short interest for DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc (DVA), to 2,798,633, a decrease of 18.39% since 06\/15\/2015. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days (at the average volume) it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed. Average daily volume for DVA at the 06\/30\/2015 settlement increased to 1,341,115, as compared to 736,369 at the 06\/15\/2015 report. That brought \"days to cover\" down to 2.09, a 55.19% decrease from the 4.66 days to cover calculated at the previous short interest data release.\nThe below chart shows the historical \"days to cover\" for DVA at previous short interest release dates:\nSTART SLIDESHOW :\nTop 25 S.A.F.E. Dividend Stocks \u00bb\nA decreased \"days to cover\" value could indicate that short sellers are no longer expecting the same decline in stock price they once were, or it could also indicate a long bet elsewhere was closed where DVA had been shorted as a hedge.\nThe chart below shows the one year performance of DVA shares, versus its 200 day moving average. Looking at this chart, DVA's low point in its 52 week range is $70.41 per share, with $85.17 as the 52 week high point \u2014 that compares with a last trade of $80.03.\n}}

{{In an unusual but legal move, Jack Hickey is running this fall for a seat on the Sequoia Healthcare District Board of Directors, even though he already sits on the board, halfway through his third term.\nHickey, who first sought a seat on the board in 2002 with a mission to dismantle it, said a win on Nov. 6 would show that voters agree the district should cease to exist and the tax dollars it collects should be distributed to other agencies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m running this time,\u201d Hickey said Wednesday. \u201cVoters, if they get the message, they\u2019ll only vote for one candidate and that will be me if they want dissolution.\u201d\nHickey jumped into the contest at 4:10 p.m. on Aug. 10, 50 minutes before the deadline. He is running against two of his board colleagues, Kim Griffin and Kathleen Kane.\nIf only Griffin and Kane had filed to run, the board could have voted to call off the election and saved about $160,000, Hickey acknowledged. But the cost of an election is minimal compared to the millions of dollars that would be reallocated to the county, cities and local school districts if the district went away, he noted.\nGriffin called Hickey\u2019s election move \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the things we\u2019re doing and what we could spend $160,000 on, it\u2019s a shame,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of tax money.\u201d\nIf Hickey beats out one of his two colleagues, he said he would take that person\u2019s seat and vacate his. That would put him in office for a full four-year term instead of the two years he has left. The board then would either have to appoint his replacement or call for a special election.\nEven if Hickey won, Griffin said he couldn\u2019t claim a mandate.\n\u201cThere are four board members who remain very committed to the mission of the district,\u201d Griffin said.\nHickey made a similar, but unsuccessful, attempt to unseat Griffin and Kane in 2008.\nSan Mateo County Deputy County Counsel Glenn Levy said while there\u2019s legal ground to prevent Hickey from holding two seats simultaneously, there\u2019s no law prohibiting him from running for a second seat.\n\u201cWe have not found any legislation that says you cannot do that,\u201d Levy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual circumstance, but the law doesn\u2019t prohibit it.\u201d\nThe Sequoia Healthcare District was established in 1947 to build and operate Sequoia Hospital. The hospital is now run by Catholic HealthCare West, which took over in 1996. As a result, the millions of tax dollars collected by the district are now distributed to health programs \u2014 including those in schools and for low-income residents \u2014 that serve Redwood City, Belmont, San Carlos, Menlo Park, Woodside, Atherton, Portola Valley and parts of southern Foster City and San Mateo.\nThough Hickey used to say his goal was to return the nearly $9 million in annual property taxes to residents, he conceded a point made in a 2008 memo from district general counsel Mark Hudak that even if the district is dissolved, its share of property taxes would likely be redistributed among other agencies within its boundary.\nEmail Bonnie Eslinger at beslinger@dailynewsgroup.com; follow her at twitter.com\/bonnieeslinger.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today expressed disappointment in a Senate vote against an amendment she cosponsored to block the District of Columbia from reviving the much-maligned Obamacare individual mandate.\nHyde-Smith was an original cosponsor of an amendment introduced by Senator Ted Cruz (R- Texas ) to stop federal funds from being used to reinstate Obamacare's individual health insurance mandate that Congress repealed last year. The Senate voted 54-44 to table the Cruz amendment to a so-call \"minibus\" appropriations package (HR.6147).\n\"It was great day when Congress overturned the ability of the federal government to force Americans to buy health insurance or be fined. I don't think any city or state should act on its own reinstate the unconstitutional Obamacare mandate,\" Hyde-Smith said. \"I regret that Senate Democrats blocked our effort to ensure the individual mandate remained dead.\"\nThe amendment was introduced to block action taken by the government of the District of Columbia in June to reinstate the individual mandate and the city's ability to penalize individuals and families who cannot afford or decide not to purchase D.C. mandated insurance plans.\nHyde-Smith has been critical of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on Mississippi , where premiums for Obamacare exchanges soared by 75 percent in its first three years. Mississippi is one of eight states with only one insurer participating in Obamacare health insurance exchanges this year.

{{At last count, the United States was spending more than $8,000 a year on healthcare for every man, woman, and child in the country. That\u2019s more than $24,000 for a family of three, and it represents almost one-fifth of all consumption spending. Is it necessary to spend this much? If not, why are we doing it? What happens if we continue? How can we stop?\nFor the past 40 years, healthcare spending has been rising at twice the rate of growth of our income. You don\u2019t have to be an accountant, a mathematician, or an economist to realize that this is unsustainable. If the cost of something you are consuming is growing twice as fast as your income, eventually it will crowd out everything else in your budget. In fact, if we continue on the path we are currently on, healthcare will crowd out all other forms of consumption by about midcentury. When today\u2019s young people reach retirement age, they will have nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and no place to live. But they will have an enormous amount of healthcare. Clearly, that\u2019s not where anyone wants to end up.\nLong before healthcare spending crowds out every other form of consumption, it will threaten to bankrupt the federal government and most state and local governments as well. This is not a uniquely American problem, by the way. Other countries are experiencing similar growth. In fact, the rate of growth of real per capita healthcare spending in the United States for the past four decades has been right in the middle of the European average. The whole developed world is traveling up a spending path that everyone regards as unsustainable.[1]\nOne consequence of that is out-of-control federal deficit spending for as far as the eye can see. For much of the last decade, the debate over the need to control entitlement spending has largely focused on Social Security. But if Social Security were our only problem, we could probably muddle through with minor changes. In terms of unfunded liability, however, Medicare is six times the problem of Social Security. And Medicaid is almost as big as Medicare.\nIn terms of the numbers, the 2009 Social Security Trustees (pre-ACA) report estimated the unfunded liability in Social Security and Medicare at $107 trillion, looking indefinitely into the future.[2] That\u2019s the amount of money we\u2019ve committed to spend over and above the premiums and dedicated taxes these programs are expected to receive, and it\u2019s about six and a half times the size of the entire US economy. Of that amount, Medicare\u2019s unfunded liability is about $89 trillion. If we throw in Medicaid, disability insurance, and other entitlement programs (treating them all as implicit promises to current and future generations), the total unfunded liability is in excess of $200 trillion.[3] Again, the bulk of it is healthcare.\nNotes:\n1. Uwe E. Reinhardt, Peter S. Hussey, and Gerard F. Anderson, \u201cUS Healthcare Spending in an International Context,\u201d Health Affairs 23 (2004): 10\u201325, doi: 10.1377\/hlthaff.23.3.10.\n2. Note, however, that this unfunded liability was officially cut in half by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which requires enormous cuts in future Medicare spending. Whether these spending cuts will actually take place, however, is highly questionable.

Suzanne Kosmas, D-Fla., will vote yes. She was a no last year. That's three no to yes flips so far today.\nAdvertisement:\nUpdate, 5:14 p.m. EDT Friday: Rep. Brad Ellsworth, D-Indiana, is a yes. Ellsworth voted yes last year, too, but he was a supporter of the Stupak Amendment's restrictive language on abortion funding, which isn't in this bill. Add that to the fact that he's currently running to replace Sen. Evan Bayh, who's retiring, and his vote was a real toss-up. Good news for Democrats.\nUpdate, 4:33 p.m. EDT Friday: Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy, D-Ohio, who voted for the House bill but has been publicly undecided this time around, has just announced that she'll be voting yes again.\nEarlier this week, demonstrations outside Kilroy's office by people looking to influence her vote were the scene of what became an infamous video of anti-reform protesters berating a man who suffers from Parkinson's Disease.\nUpdate, 4:22 p.m. EDT Friday: Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., a no vote last fall who Democrats were hoping to sway, will vote no again, Pittsburgh's KDKA reports.\nUpdate, 4:04 p.m. EDT Friday: Democrats just scored big. Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Fla., has reportedly said he will vote for the bill. This is a pick-up: Boyd was a no last year, and he'd been expected to stay a no.\nUpdate, 2:50 p.m. EDT Friday: Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Va., a yes vote from the fall who'd been wavering, has reportedly decided to support the bill -- though he apparently wants assurances from at least 50 senators that they'll vote for the planned fixes to the Senate bill. Perriello is a freshman in a conservative district, so this vote does make him more vulnerable than he already is -- he's a top Republican target this year -- and he'd been shying away from his party earlier this week, voting for a GOP resolution that would have forbidden the use of a House procedure that might be used to get the full final package approved.\nAdvertisement:\nUpdate, 12:17 p.m. EDT Friday: Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., will vote yes. She was a yes on the House's bill last year as well.\nUpdate, 11:05 a.m. EDT Friday: Rep. John Boccieri, D-Ohio, has announced he'll be voting yes. That's a gain for the Democrats, since he voted against the House's bill.\n---\nAs we get closer to a vote in the House on healthcare reform -- it could come as early as Sunday -- we're starting to get a clearer picture of how that vote will shake out. Several members who've been on the fence announced their decisions on Thursday, and there are likely to be a few more on Friday.\nAdvertisement:\nOn Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got a couple yes votes in her pocket, thanks to Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., and Rep. Betsy Markey, D-Colo. But Reps. Michael Arcuri, D-N.Y., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass. -- both of whom voted yes on the House's bill last year -- wiped out those gains by deciding to vote no this time around. (Even a lobbying effort by President Obama couldn't sway Lynch.)\nMeanwhile, on Thursday we learned that a few Democrats who voted in favor of the House bill last year but who had been undecided about this version of the legislation will support it. Those members are Reps. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., Dale Kildee, D-Mich., and Dan Maffei, D-N.Y.\nThere's already been one announcement on Friday: Rep. Charlie Wilson, D-Ohio, who voted yes last fall, will do the same now. Later in the day, Rep. John Boccieri, D-Ohio, who voted no last year, is slated to announce his position.\nAdvertisement:\nTo pass the bill, Pelosi needs to cobble together 216 votes, which constitutes a majority in a body that's currently a few members short. At this point, the consensus is basically that she's already gotten more than 200 votes, but after that, there are varying whip counts out there -- some as low as just 200, some as high as 211.\n}}

{{The interplay of health and design isn\u2019t new. In 1857, Nurse (and Data Scientist) Florence Nightingale used design principles to illustrate the casualties of soldiers in the Crimean War and changed national policy.\nNightingale showed that soldiers weren\u2019t dying mainly on the battlefield, but instead they were dying in the hospitals due to the poor sanitary conditions there. Nightingale used this now famous diagram to influence hygiene practices in military hospitals, which resulted in lower mortality rates. The kind of design that Nightingale used can be thought of as, \u201cDesign to improve understandability.\u201d\nThe eponymous design firm IDEO is another organization for which the intersection of health and design isn\u2019t new. Back when I was at MIT, I first came to know IDEO in the late 90s through their medical device practices formerly based in Massachusetts.\nIf you look at IDEO\u2019s long list history of design for the medical space \u2014 ranging from a kidney transporter to a heart monitor \u2014 you can see that IDEO\u2019s vaunted \u201cdesign thinking\u201d has long been grounded in a lot of \u201cdesign doing.\u201d The kind of design that IDEO has brought to bear in this space is, \u201cDesign to improve usability.\u201d\nToday, designers in the technology industry are working hard to speak of design in these terms of Nightingale and IDEO\u2019s intentions to use design for understandability and usability.\nAnd with the publication of the 2015 Design in Tech Report, I showed the intersection of design and profitability by highlighting designer co-founded startups like Airbnb and Pinterest that have collectively raised billions of dollars in the last decade.\nHowever, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish the word \u201cdesign\u201d from another common use in the consumer world \u2013 which is to seduce consumers with perfectly polished surfaces and comforting aesthetics.\nAs someone who studied traditional electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, I don\u2019t find it surprising at all \u2013 because a traditional technical education, or business education for that matter, doesn\u2019t go deep into the history of art and design.\nThe role of design in doing the job of making something more attractive \u2014 \u201cDesign for getting noticed\u201d \u2013 is an ancient craft that goes back to the symbol of the cross all the way to the brightly lit apple logos on the lids of many laptops today.\nDesign for Understandability and Usability\nBack to the present, we had a full room at a recent KPCB event \u2013 my partner Lynne Chou led a fantastic panel with Michelle Kim, Patrick Morrow, and Megs Fulton. They all addressed design as framed within the aforementioned spaces of understandability and usability.\nMichelle Kim, lead designer at Mango Health, thinks designers should be gamifying healthcare apps so they are fun to play. Kim posits that the same person who enjoys playing Candy Crush Saga, should also have as much ease managing their chronic illness.\nThe difficult design problem sits within the fact that each user is different depending on the patient\u2019s diagnostic history \u2013 so one size can\u2019t fit all, as would be the case of a videogame design.\nKim enhances understandability by leveraging a patient\u2019s familiarity with something they already know. Designers tend to have a broad vocabulary of objects and experiences in the world that they use to help a user \u201crhyme\u201d something new with what is already old to them. In doing so, they create a context for a new user to be more apt to feel they can understand something new.\nPractice Fusion, the cloud-based electronic medical system, mirrors the real-life workflow of a doctor\u2019s office. Patrick Morrow, principal visual designer at Practice Fusion, explained that the front desk person spends a lot of time in the calendar system, while a nurse requires charting workflows for one-on-one meetings with patients.\nMorrow\u2019s example illustrates how usability cannot be designed for without understanding the social and physical mechanics of the context for a real-life user.\nIn the past, many health technology IT services that were primarily designed by engineers lacked this empathy for the user because it was simply impossible for engineers to sit within a hospital waiting room or in a doctor\u2019s office. That is now changing as designers are being brought early into the process of designing digital health services to ask the question, \u201cHow many of our potential users have we talked to, or visited?\u201d\nDesign for Profitability and Performance\nAfter Lynne\u2019s panel I hosted one with Misfit founder Sonny Vu and Jason Mayden, a professor at Stanford\u2019s d.school and the former global director of innovation for digital sport and former senior global design director for the Jordan Brand at Nike.\nFrom Jason, came what I think is a key aspect of design that is implicit and important in business today: Design for performance. Mayden\u2019s design mentor at Nike, Tinker Hatfield, taught him that great design comes from working within extreme constraints.\nMayden learned from Hatfield how the material choices in a shoe design could cost an athlete the gold medal if the extra weight slowed the athlete down. As Mayden said that evening, \u201cGreat design is great restraint \u2013 every ounce, every stitch, matters.\u201d\n}}

{{Senate majority leader spoke to impasse over key aspects of Republican bill at an event Thursday, but said \u2018no action was not an alternative\u2019\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday hinted that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could fall short as conservatives and moderates in his conference remain at an impasse over key aspects of the bill.\nBefore leaving Washington for a week-long Fourth of July recess, McConnell delayed a vote on the Republican healthcare bill after it was clear there was not enough support for the plan, which would leave 22 million fewer people without health insurance over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\u201cIf my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur,\u201d McConnell told constituents at a Rotary Club lunch on Thursday, according to the Associated Press.\n\u201cNo action is not an alternative,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.\u201d\nActivists cry cowardice as Republican senators shut doors to healthcare town halls Read more\nMcConnell\u2019s comments were quickly embraced by his Democratic counterpart, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that Senator McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the exchanges are fixable, and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said time and time again, Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law. At the top of the list should be ensuring cost-sharing payments are permanent, which will protect healthcare for millions.\u201d\nMcConnell faces a daunting task as he works behind the scenes with senators to craft a bill that bridges the ideological divide within his conference. Moderates, especially those from states that opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA (also known as Obamacare) are wary of scaling back spending on the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and conservatives are irked the plan does not go further to repeal the law.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the position of a guy with a Rubik\u2019s cube \u2013 trying to twist the dial in such a way to get at least 50 members of my conference who can agree to a version of repealing and replacing Obamcare,\u201d McConnell told Kentucky voters at a town hall-style event on Thursday, according to NBC. \u201cThat is a very timely subject that I\u2019m grappling with as we speak.\u201d\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer holds up a photograph of constituents who would be adversely affected by the proposed Republican bill. Photograph: Andrew Harnik\/AP\nAn initial draft of the Senate Republican healthcare plan mirrors the structure of the House bill, which passed in May. The measure would repeal key pieces of the ACA while extracting deep cuts to Medicaid compared to spending under current law.\nMcConnell has since made changes to the bill, including adding $45bn to combat the opioid epidemic, among other adjustments. The CBO is expected to release another analysis sometime next week, a likely indicator that Senate Republicans will not vote on the plan until later this month.\nOn Thursday, a handful of senate Republicans echoed McConnell\u2019s skepticism about whether the party would be able to reach an agreement on healthcare.\n\u201cIt is precarious,\u201d senator Ted Cruz, a conservative of Texas, said on San Antonio\u2019s KTSA Radio. \u201cThe majority is so narrow, I don\u2019t know if we get it done or not.\u201d\nSenate Republicans are using a special budget process known as reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster of the repeal plan. To pass the bill, Republicans need support from at least 50 of their 52 members. No Democrats are expected to support a repeal measure. In the case of a tie, vice-president Mike Pence would cast the final vote.\nAmerica's broken healthcare system \u2013 in one simple chart Read more\nCruz has offered an amendment that would allow insurance companies to sell non-compliant plans as long as they also offer at least one plan that does meet Obamacare standards. Experts on both sides of the political debate said such an action could devastate insurance markets.\nSenator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas who surprised his party when he came out against the bill, told constituents in Palco that healthcare reform is \u201calmost impossible to try to solve when you\u2019re trying to do it with 51 votes in the United States Senate, in which there is not significant consensus on what the final result ought to be\u201d.\nAs the debate over healthcare rages, Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania who supports the bill, suggested during a televised town hall on Wednesday that McConnell was \u201cseveral weeks away\u201d from winning enough support for a vote. Asked why Republicans were struggling to fulfill a years-long campaign promise, Toomey offered a candid reply.\n\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t expect Donald Trump to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most of my colleagues didn\u2019t, so we didn\u2019t expect to be in this situation.\u201d\n}}

{{I love you, America! Between living in your country as a digital nomad for part of the year and attending events as part of my job, I've spent a lot of time in the United States. One of the biggest misconceptions that I've run into when talking to my American pals is that they believe we receive free healthcare.\nThis is mostly incorrect.\nMost Canadians, with the exception of Alberta, where I live for half of the year, either pay for our hospital and doctor visits as part of our taxes or are billed monthly by the province we live in. Having been born and raised in Canada, I've taken for granted being able to see doctors or receiving emergency medical care whenever I need it \u2013 right up to the point where I no longer could. I needed to visit the hospital, shortly after moving from one province to another. I'd registered as a resident there, but my paperwork had somehow been lost. A month after seeing a doctor, I received an $800 bill in the mail. So, that sucked. Even when things work the way that they're meant to, not everything is covered. Things like dentistry, massage therapy or counseling only happen on a pay-per-use basis, or if you're lucky enough to have a job that affords you a health plan. I fall into this latter group, thanks to my partner.\nAnd then there's the cost of drugs.\nAs The Guardian recently pointed out, Canada has the second highest drug prices of any industrialized country in the world. We're also the only country in the world with a universal health plan that doesn't cover the cost of drugs. If you're a Canadian with a chronic illness, like my father before he passed in 2008, affording the drugs required to ease your pain or keep you alive can leave a family in poverty. Hell, thanks to some interesting\/poor choices in my past, I've been left with PTSD. Without my partner's health plan, paying for the drugs that help me to feel safe and grounded while I work my shit out in therapy and on the streets every day might be too expensive for me to afford. I have to imagine that a lot of Americans worry about similar things happening to them.\nAnyway, I'll be writing for Boing Boing for at least the next month or so. Are there any other questions about Canada that I can try to answer for you? Hit the comments and let me know.\nImage courtesy of pxhere.\n}}

{{A version of this post first appeared on the author's personal blog. The views expressed are his own.\nDespite Africa\u2019s exponential economic growth and development over the past decade and additional support from the international donor community, progress towards many of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been slow.\nGreater gains have been made over the past 15 years, however Africa\u2019s performance overall continues to lag on health indicators and with the result, the continent is off-track to meet all of the MDGs.\nIn addition, a number of challenges still face the vast majority of the continent, including insufficient internal and external resources allocated to achieving the MDGs, inadequate human resources, weak institutional capacity, persistent inequities in access to proven interventions, inadequate statistical health data, and weak monitoring and evaluation capacity.\nLooking closer at the specific goals that have an impact on health-related issues on the continent, the following challenges still exist:\n* Childhood mortality: Although the majority of African countries have made steady progress in reducing child and under-five mortality, only six countries are on track to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.\nMore African countries need to scale up preventative healthcare in the fight against the main diseases that cause child mortality, namely measles, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, and AIDS. Targeted interventions for newborn babies need to be accelerated, as newborns are more likely to succumb than older children.\n(Read about efforts being made around the world to reduce infant mortality.)\nA potential solution to this challenge is empowering more women and removing social barriers to their accessing basic services, introducing measures to give poorer families better access to critical services, and increasing the local accountability of health systems.\n* Maternal health: The maternal mortality rate for the African region as a whole stands at 460 deaths per 100,000 live births. Indeed, only two countries, Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea, are on track to reduce maternal mortality by 3\/4 between 1990 and 2015. Most countries in southern Africa have made no progress at all on this target.\nIn addition, one in four women on the African continent who wish to space or delay their next pregnancy cannot do so because of lack of contraceptives. The rates of delivery attended by a skilled health practitioner are very low, especially in West Africa. Lack of access to maternal health services tends to be especially acute in rural areas and urban slum communities.\nThe cost of accessing prenatal care services (including transportation and user fees), geographical access, and cultural barriers are major impediments to women seeking care during their pregnancies.\nMaternal mortality also remains the leading cause of death in adolescent girls. Poor quality of service for pregnant women is another major concern. In Malawi, for example, a recent study found that only 13 percent of clinics had 24-hour midwifery care, which represents a major hazard for maternal emergencies.\n* Combating HIV\/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases: Africa is starting to win the battle against HIV\/AIDS in most countries, partly due to the significant vertical funding from external aid agencies.\nThere has been a fall in the prevalence rate, particularly among women, a steep decline in the regional rate of new infections, a reduction in the number of AIDS-related deaths, and a drop in mother-to-child transmission of the disease. Greater access to antiretroviral therapy, in combination with behavioural changes such as the increased condom usage, have underpinned HIV\/AIDS progress in Africa. Sustaining access to critical antiretroviral medicines in an uncertain funding environment will however present a major challenge to the countries worst affected by the disease.\nWith regard to malaria, the acceleration of preventative and control strategies such as the distribution of free or heavily subsidized insecticide-treated bed-nets has reduced its incidence. Malaria mortality rates have consequently declined by more than 1\/3 since 2000. But access to the most effective drugs, namely Artemisinin-based combination therapy, is still limited. Furthermore, the targeting of substantial amounts of donor funding to individual diseases has reduced amounts available for broader health needs.\nTuberculosis remains a major problem in the African region with 500,000 deaths annually, accounting for over 26 percent of notified TB cases in the world. Southern Africa is the worst affected sub-region. While 19 countries have been able to treat over 85 percent of those affected, the co-infection of TB and HIV as well as drug-resistant TB and multidrug-resistant TB continue to complicate treatment of the disease.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nAs we enter the last two years of the UN mandate for the Millennium Development Goals, time is running out for Africa to reach the finish line. But strides have been made in improving the lives of millions on the continent, including the most vulnerable in society.\nGreater policy focus and efforts will need to be developed and effectively implemented in the future to ensure that more is done in relation to development and progress on the continent to have a real impact for the generations to come.\n}}

{{Hundreds of Hollywood women banded together last January to launch Time\u2019s Up , a sprawling initiative to combat workplace sexual harassment. Over the last year, the group has wielded its star power to gather nearly $25 million in donations for its defense fund, which provides legal aid to lower wage workers who are subject to sexual misconduct; the fund has already dedicated $6 million to 100 legal cases and investigations. Time\u2019s Up has also spawned multiple affiliates that are spreading the organization\u2019s mission to other industries\u2013advertising and tech, for example. Today, Time\u2019s Up is adding another affiliate to its ranks.\nThe organization\u2019s latest offshoot is Time\u2019s Up Healthcare, which will focus on sexual misconduct and the entrenched gender dynamics\u2013and inequity\u2013across the industry. More than 50 founding members are leading the charge, including a range of healthcare professionals, from nurses and physician assistants to clinical pharmacists. The group will work to connect women across the industry, provide resources for those impacted by sexual misconduct, and advocate for policies and practices that will help mitigate discrimination.\n\u201cWe were paying attention to how Time\u2019s Up was supporting women in Hollywood, but specifically how it included women who were marginalized,\u201d says Dara Kass, a steering committee member of Time\u2019s Up Healthcare. \u201cSo, when the opportunity came up for Time\u2019s Up to build an affiliate in healthcare, it was really a very natural fit for the work we had already been doing.\u201d\nKass, an emergency medicine doctor, is also the founder and CEO of FemInEM, a blog and conference focused on promoting gender equity in emergency medicine. \u201cEmergency medicine is just one field of medicine,\u201d she continues. \u201cThis is a much larger attempt at connecting women across the entire house of healthcare, at every level.\u201d\nHealthcare as an industry is said to represent one-sixth of the U.S. economy, and women reportedly account for 80% of healthcare workers and more than 50% of medical school applicants and matriculants. But there\u2019s a significant drop-off when you look at leadership: Only 11% of healthcare CEOs are women, and there isn\u2019t a single woman at the helm of a Fortune 500 healthcare company. None of the healthcare companies in the Fortune 500 have gender parity on their boards or executive teams. And as in other industries, when women do make it to the executive level, they\u2019re more likely to be in human resources, legal, or marketing roles. This lack of representation holds true across healthcare startups, as well, in no small part because women have more trouble securing funding: Just 9% of health tech companies are founded by women.\n\u201cHealthcare is not only hierarchical in terms of it having historically been a white, male-dominated profession,\u201d says Monica McLemore, a founding member of Time\u2019s Up Healthcare and an assistant professor at UCSF\u2019s nursing school. \u201cThere are even greater disparities when you look at different clinical specialties.\u201d In areas like emergency medicine or cardiology, she notes, the gap widens, and men dominate leadership roles, along with even policy and advocacy work. This holds true even in terms of research and public funding. \u201cMen disproportionately receive research funding and publish scientific papers,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, they end up citing each other and determining what science is important to be funded.\u201d\nGiven the power imbalance and hierarchal structure inherent to the industry, it\u2019s little surprise that 30% of women physicians have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, while 33% of nurses have been subject to physical violence and bullying. And many women in medicine face down sexual misconduct before even setting foot in a hospital: About half of female medical students report being harassed while still in school.\n}}

{{Salon's prescriptions for the healthcare bill How to improve the reform legislation -- without scrapping it and starting over\nFirst, the Senate Democrats dropped the public option, promising to appease liberals by letting people buy in to Medicare starting at age 55. Then, when Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., threatened to filibuster that version of the bill, too, they got rid of the buy-ins. As a result, some progressives have been calling for the Senate to kill the bill completely, arguing that no reform is better than this reform. Former Democratic primary candidate and former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean came out against the bill in its current form earlier this week (although Dean told Salon's Joe Conason he's open to fixing the bill and not killing it).\nBut killing the bill could mean absolutely nothing happens on healthcare reform at all. The Senate has been working on this for most of the year; if it dies now, it's not coming back. And even though Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is unlikely to find 60 votes to restore the public option or the Medicare buy-in, there are other ways to make a bad bill better before lawmakers vote on final passage. Here's a breakdown of some progressive concerns about the healthcare reform bill most likely to face the Senate, and what Senate Democrats can do to address them. One word of caution: So far, there is no \"bill,\" there are numerous amendments being floated, and it's not sure exactly what will emerge for a Senate vote. And of course, whatever the Senate passes still has to be merged with the House's far stronger legislation. But here are the top five critiques about what's out there for now, and how to improve the bill to answer them:\nAdvertisement:\n1) Individual mandates\nThe problem: Without a public option, the Senate bill would force Americans to buy healthcare from private insurance companies, who could act as a monopoly. So according to this line of reasoning, the real winners would just be the private insurers who got us into this mess in the first place. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann is one proponent of this point of view, arguing on \"Countdown\" Wednesday night that he will go to jail rather than purchase private insurance under this mandate, and urging his progressive audience to do the same.\nThe diagnosis: There is no way to expand the current insurance system to cover everyone without an individual mandate. At the moment, insurance companies discriminate against people who would be most likely to use insurance by making it unavailable to those with preexisting conditions. Healthcare reform would make this illegal and force insurers to make coverage available to everyone. But without an individual mandate, young, healthy people might not buy healthcare at all, causing premiums for older, sicker people to skyrocket. That's why every healthcare system (British, Swedish, French, Canadian, you name it) with anything approximating universal coverage has some version of individual mandates. Otherwise, universal coverage just doesn't work.\nSalon's prescription: Keep individual mandates -- and work on introducing higher subsidies and better regulations to help make insurance affordable for the millions of people who will suddenly have access to it.\n2) Who's covered, and how?\nThe problem: While proponents say the bill will extend coverage to another 31 million Americans, that's a shell game; they're doing it by mandating Americans to purchase insurance.\nAdvertisement:\nThe diagnosis: The bill would do more than just make people purchase private healthcare: 14 million of these people would gain coverage through the expansion of Medicaid. The other 17 million, who would effectively be \"forced\" to buy into some private plan, are mostly people who can't currently afford to buy healthcare. Under the Senate bill, people making up to 400 percent of the poverty line ($88,200 for a family of four) would be given subsidies to purchase this insurance.\nSalon's prescription: Again, push for higher subsidies extended to more Americans, so the new insurance isn't as unaffordable as the status quo is.\n3) Preexisting conditions\nThe problem: Allegedly, the ban prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions is meaningless. Sure, insurance companies would have to sell these people a plan -- but they could still charge exorbitant premiums and effectively price them out of the market.\nAdvertisement:\nThe diagnosis: Under the most recent draft of the Senate bill, insurance companies can still charge more for insurance under certain circumstances. However, the bill dictates that premium rates can only vary based on age (older people can be charged up to three times as much for insurance as other planholders) or tobacco use (smokers or other users can be charged up to 1.5 times as much for insurance). Of course, in an ideal world, these factors wouldn't affect premium costs either, but the Senate bill would still make it significantly easier for people with preexisting health conditions to buy insurance.\nSalon's prescription: Other than ensuring that there aren't any hidden loopholes, leave it be. The Senate's regulations regarding preexisting conditions would actually accomplish quite a bit.\n4) Annual care caps\nAdvertisement:\nThe problem: The Senate healthcare bill would allow insurance companies to implement annual dollar limits on medical care for people with a costly illness like cancer. This would defeat the purpose of health insurance, since it would no longer protect people from the worst-case scenario (you know, the one where you contract an incredibly costly illness whose treatment you can't possibly afford).\nThe diagnosis: Although the Senate Finance Committee prohibited annual caps altogether, the Senate bill would only bar \"unreasonable\" annual caps on medical costs. A Reid spokesperson justified the decision by citing concerns that banning all annual limits could lead to higher premiums. Getting rid of these caps might lead to higher premiums, but permitting them would definitively defang health insurance: It would provide coverage for everyone except people who need it most.\nSalon's prescription: Remove this provision from the bill, or define \"unreasonable\" caps at a level that actually makes sense for the average family's budget. This shouldn't be too difficult: The White House has already indicated that it wants to strike the provision, and even Lieberman hasn't threatened to filibuster a bill that doesn't permit annual caps.\nAdvertisement:\n5) Insurers operating across state lines\nThe problem: The Senate bill would permit insurance companies to sell policies across state lines -- and let the companies choose which states' laws and regulations they would have to follow. This would allow insurers to avoid the strongest consumer protections and benefits required by state governments. A group of House Democrats from Maine and California argue that the arrangement \"will lead to a race to the bottom in insurance regulation and severely threaten the important and often lifesaving protections the residents of our states enjoy.\"\nThe diagnosis: The bill does already contain several provisions to help avert this scenario. First, states would only be able to join interstate compacts by enacting a state law. So, any state that ended up undermining its own insurance regulations by joining an exchange would have done so through its own legislation -- which is unlikely. Also, insurance companies -- regardless of where they were based -- would still have to comply with some of the regulations of the state where the insurance purchaser lives. Finally, insurers would also need to obey the federal requirements stipulated by the bill in order to participate in the insurance exchanges it would set up. (But these regulations have yet to be spelled out.)\nSalon's prescription: Push for stricter federal requirements as part of the insurance exchange system the bill would set up. Doing so would force insurance companies to provide better coverage across the nation, regardless of what state they were based in.\n}}

{{Once you've identified a trend you want to invest in, how do you decide which individual stocks to buy? The diabetes treatment and medical marijuana are two of healthcare's most exciting research areas, but not all diabetes or marijuana stocks are created equal. On this Industry Focus episode, healthcare specialists Kristine Harjes and Todd Campbell explain what you need to consider before investing in these growing markets.\nA full transcript follows the video.\nKristine Harjes: Do this, not that. This is Industry Focus.\nThanks for tuning into Industry Focus, healthcare edition. I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and I'm joined by Motley Fool healthcare specialist Todd Campbell. Today, we wanted to do something a little different. We wanted to talk about investing smartly in trends. The healthcare sector is packed with companies doing new, exciting things, and there's a lot of hype around certain, new class of drugs and new approaches to treating major diseases.\nCompetition is fierce. As an investor, how do you know where to put your money? You spot this trend, you say, \"That looks really promising,\" but how do you find a specific company that is going to be the best bang for your buck? We're going to dive into the medical marijuana market a little later, but first let's talk about some companies that are in the diabetes space.\nDiabetes is a disease that affects approximately 29 million Americans, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's 9.3% of the American population. That number is expected to grow, too. It's estimated to reach as high as 387 million around the globe and by 2035 to 592 million patients.\nTodd, kick us off. If you're looking at this space and you say, \"That looks like it has a lot of promise as an investor,\" where would you look to put your money?\nTodd Campbell: I think it's one of the most interesting things and profit-friendly areas for investors to be considering in healthcare. There's a lot of reasons that the prevalence of diabetes is rising. You've got a lot of emerging markets [that] are getting wealthier, access to food is improving, you can argue that we're living more sedentary lifestyles.\nAs you mentioned, the International Diabetes Federation estimates that there are 387 million people worldwide with this disease and that number is going to grow by 205 million people in the next 20 years. That's astonishing. That's two-thirds of the population of the United States in global growth for this.\nI think that's attracted a lot of investors to say \"This is a massive market. If we could invest in companies that are improving outcomes, reducing the chance of diabetes related disease, like heart disease; that's smart investing.\" Let's find companies that could disrupt the market as we see it today. I think that's a big reason why a lot of people flock to one company that you and I talk a lot about: MannKind (NASDAQ:56400P706).\nHarjes: There is so much hope behind MannKind who has developed this inhalable insulin called Afrezza, which was finally approved by the FDA in 2014. It's being marketed by Sanofi, which sounds like that would be a really promising marketing partner because Sanofi was the maker of the multi-billion dollar, long lasting insulin Lantus. Sanofi begins their marketing and it's nothing short of disappointing.\nYou've got Q1 sales, when it first got into the market of \u20ac1 million, which is about $1.1 million, Q2 comes around, you've got the entire quarter on the market and they only sell 2 million. On the one hand, you say it doubled, but these are still really tiny numbers. $2.2 million.\nCampbell: It's not cool.\nHarjes: It's not even close to what people had hoped for this drug.\nCampbell: It's nothing. People were thinking that patients would flock to doctors' offices to be able to cast aside the decades-long reliance on injecting insulin. Afrezza is obviously inhalable insulin. It's quick acting, but there's a lot of concern that if injectable are working well right now. Why do I want to go ahead and be inhaling insulin into my lungs, potentially taking on some risks associated with that?\nI think there are pie-in-the-sky hopes associated with Afrezza going in because it's a potentially disruptive drug, looking at the way insulin is dosed. The reality is, great ideas don't always translate into commercial successes. I think the takeaway there for investors is that, when it comes to finding and exploiting these big trends -- in this case, diabetes -- try not to focus on companies that have one iron in the fire. One drug, one promising solution.\nDoing so exposes you to a tremendous amount of risk. There are plenty of great companies out there working on next-generation diabetes treatments that investors can consider. You get the granddaddy of them all, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), who's the market share leader in diabetes care. They make insulin that's short lasting, rapid, long lasting; you name it, they make it. They control about 28% roughly of the whole of all diabetes treatment globally.\nIf you really want to play the long term, 20-year trend in rising diabetes prevalence, focusing on a big company like that can make a lot of sense.\nHarjes: The interesting thing about Novo is you don't find a lot of companies of their size that are pure plays. They do have some other irons in the fire. They dabble a bit in hemophilia. They have some growth hormone therapy, but they're really a diabetes powerhouse. They've done great. Their key drug is called Victoza. They recently have this new, higher dosage of Victoza that's being marketed as Saxenda for obesity; they seem to really know what they're doing to work with this established group of drugs that has been absolutely excellent for them, and improve up on them and really be able to compete in this market.\nCampbell: They get 80% of their sales from diabetes. It's a not a pure play on diabetes, but it's pretty close. I think what's exciting about what they're doing is that they have so many different research programs going on right now that could change the way that diabetes is treated in the outcomes. One of the most exciting things -- and something I think people should bear in mind to consider -- the ability to turn insulin into a tablet.\nThey're working on two different drugs that would allow you to take your insulin rather than through an injection, as a tablet. While inhaling insulin is an improvement over injection, a tablet has got to be the Holy Grail in delivery for insulin.\nHarjes: That's another thing that makes investing in this trend a little bit tricky. You're not sure who's going to come out with this next, latest, completely revolutionary way of treating diabetes. I want to bring up one more name in this space that I think could continue to be really profitable, even if the way we treat diabetes starts to change.\nThat's because these guys are actually a device maker. They're called DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) and they produce and sell this product called a continuous glucose monitor. It's designed to show patients what their glucose level is constantly. You don't just get one single reading every time you check, you can actually get a trend. You can see if the line is going up or down.\nThese guys are expanding pretty rapidly. They've got partnerships with Google. Their life sciences team is working on making this tiny, cloud connected, glucose sensor that's the size of a bandage. Talk about convenience right there. DexCom's main driver right now is looking to ease the burden on patients who are trying to monitor their glucose levels.\nThey're going to be linked up with the Apple Watch, they have monitoring integration with the Apple iPhone, and this system will be available on Android eventually -- probably next year, I would say. One of the really interesting things about it is that it's got a razor and blades model. They sell this kit, and you've got the monitor itself, but then you need to keep buying sensors.\nOne only lasts for seven days. To me, this looks like a really good way of capturing part of this growing diabetes market. It's a more concentrated risk than your Novo Nordisk, but what do you think, Todd?\nCampbell: I love the company. I've owned it in the past. I'm not currently invested in it, and I'm wishing that I was. I may have to revisit it. DexCom is something that everyone can benefit from. A significant number of patients don't have their glucose blood sugar levels under control. At any given point of the day, you're either high or low and you don't know it.\nOften times you're delivering insulin after the fact. So being able to have something that's showing you real time -- almost like an interlay chart for us investors -- what's going on with your blood sugar levels... it could really improve patients' ability to administer their insulin correctly. That is really important because that could reduce the progression of the disease toward heart disease and some of these other things that could lead to death.\nHarjes: This will definitely be an interesting space to watch going forward. Let's pivot a bit. As I mentioned earlier in the episode, we wanted to talk about medical marijuana, which is approved for legal, medical reasons in 23 states. You've also got four states and the District of Columbia that have approved marijuana for recreational use for adults.\nThe trend is certainly going upward as far as the percentage of people who approve of marijuana either being legalized recreationally or medically. It seems like this is an industry that investors would be smart to get in on now. There is so much hype around it, but what we want to know today is: is there a good way of investing in this industry\/\nCampbell: I think a lot of people look at the marijuana industry and they think -- look at what Reynolds and Philip Morris did with Tobacco. Can you imagine being one of the first investors in Reynolds, or Philip Morris? You start thinking that way and you think, \"Wow! This is really exciting! I've got to go out and find these companies that are in Colorado that are growing, either wholesaling or retailing medical or legal cannabis.\nI think while people are right in saying that getting in early on a trend that's likely to continue growing the way marijuana adoption is growing, there's a big risk in going out to buy these fledgling players, especially since so many of them are listed on pink sheets. For listeners and viewers that aren't familiar with pink sheets, it's not an exchange. It's really just a listing of \"This is how much you can buy shares in this company for, this is how much you can sell them for.\"\nIt's an unregulated market, which means that any company can get on the pink sheets. You could end up with a shell company that's essentially worthless. You could end up with an inability to sell the shares when push comes to shove, if you need to get out of it. There's a lot of risk associated with these pink sheet companies, and I really worry that a lot of investors who are interested in building a portfolio of marijuana stocks are focusing too much attention on these names.\nHarjes: When you look at these microcap marijuana stocks, it's definitely a danger zone. At The Motley Fool, we hold ourselves to a rule where we don't talk about anything too small because we don't even want the possibility of affecting a security's price. Maybe I'm just flattering myself on the popularity of our podcast, but rules are still rules.\nThere are two companies that I won't mention by name, but we used to talk about them back before their market caps fell completely under our limit. Looking at what has happened to them since makes me want to bank my head against the wall for people that are considering putting their money in these stocks.\nOne of the companies was late with their SEC filings three out of the last four quarters. Another one, their 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014, and then released a statement in June, saying, \"That was wrong. We had this mistake and it was material.\" Meaning it was a big deal. Just sit tight and we're going to be redoing our statements.\nAs an investor, how are you supposed to trust these companies and put your money behind them, when they don't even know the state of their own finances?\nCampbell: You can't. You have hundreds of operators out there who are all trying to move in and capture part of this market. There will be winners and losers. Right now, I think the odds are that you're going to have far more losers than you will winners. I think what makes more sense is, rather than focusing on the pink sheets and these smaller, unproven players; if you really want to have some exposure to the basket, consider those companies that are actually developing drugs on an FDA approved pathway.\nThere are two companies that are working on marijuana therapies that investors might want to consider: GW Pharma (NASDAQ:GWPH), and Insys (NASDAQ:INSY). Both companies have robust research programs that are dedicated to finding therapies that are based upon the cannabinoids that are within marijuana. THC is the psychoactive component of marijuana and there's already a marijuana drug based on THC that's been on the market since the '80s called Marinol.\nThere is some evidence that shows you can develop drugs, prove their efficacy, prove their safety through clinical trials, clear the FDA hurdles, and then once they reach the market they can become strong, top sellers. Both GW Pharma and Insys pose their own set of risks; they're certainly not risk free, but they definitely don't have the same level or risk associated with the marijuana stocks trading on the pink sheets.\nHarjes: I would agree. If you're looking for a marijuana stock, these two are probably your best bets, even though Insys isn't quite a marijuana stock -- yes, they have marijuana research, but that's not their bread and butter, whereas GW Pharma is definitely qualified as a marijuana stock. For me, this industry is too risky, but if that's the trend that you're going after, the takeaway is at least go for some of these bigger companies that are trading on reputable exchanges that you can at least trust their financial statements.\nCampbell: Exactly. The other thing on both of these companies, anything can happen. Clinical trials fail all the time. 90% of every drug that goes into phase 1 is likely to end up in a dust bin rather than on a pharmacy shelf. You can't put too much stock in a phase 1 result or a phase 2 result. You really have to just be patient. Let these drugs work their way through the pipeline and to the FDA.\nIt is good to know that both these companies have cash on the books. They're not heavily embedded, so they have money that they're using for these research programs, and they're not likely to go bankrupt anytime soon. That's a positive.\nLike you said, this is a very risky area to be trafficking in. Make sure that if marijuana investing is something that intrigues you, you're keeping it very small and you're only putting a small portion of your money to work in that space.\nHarjes: I guess that brings up that there are two levels of consideration. You want to pick what trends are the ones that you find most interesting, and are suitable for your risk tolerance, and then once you have your trends identified, you can dig down a bit more into specific companies.\nMaybe in the end, the two things that we've talked about today -- diabetes and marijuana -- maybe they aren't the trends that are calling out to you. Hopefully you can use some of the same type of thinking that Todd and I have been through today to guide you toward the best investments in whatever trend you're looking at.\nWhether it's Obamacare, healthcare reform, immuno-oncology, personalized medicine, there are so many different trends within the healthcare sector, and outside of it, too. Whenever you're looking to invest in any up-and-coming trend, just be on the watch for how much hype is baked into the valuation and be mindful of how much of a pure play you're looking for.\nIf you are interested in either of the two trends that we've talked about today, take a deeper look. Do a deeper dive on your DexCom or Insys of the world. As always, people on this program may have interests in the stocks that they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against those stocks. So, don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.\nDo your own research, have fun with it. They're both really intriguing spaces to dig into. Let us know if you have any questions about what you come up with -- any better ideas for investing in these sectors or different trends that you're looking at that you think could be better opportunities. Thanks, Todd, as always. Listeners, thanks for being with us today. We'll talk to you next week.\n}}

{{The day before Sunday's healthcare vote, President Barack Obama gave an unscripted talk to House Democrats. Near the end, he spoke about why his party should pass reform: \"Every once in a while a moment comes where you have a chance to vindicate all those best hopes that you had about yourself, about this country, where you have a chance to make good on those promises that you made ... And this is the time to make true on that promise. We are not bound to win, but we are bound to be true. We are not bound to succeed, but we are bound to let whatever light we have shine.\"\nAnd on the other side, here's what Newt Gingrich \u2013 the Republican former speaker of the House and a man celebrated by many in his party as an intellectual leader \u2013 had to say: if Democrats pass health reform, \"they will have destroyed their party much as Lyndon Johnson shattered the Democratic party for 40 years\" by passing civil rights legislation.\nI'd argue that Gingrich is wrong about that: proposals to guarantee health insurance have often been controversial before they go into effect \u2013 Ronald Reagan famously argued that Medicare would mean the end of American freedom \u2013 but are popular once enacted.\nBut that's not the point I want to make. Instead, I want you to consider the contrast: on one side, the closing argument was an appeal to our better angels, urging politicians to do what is right, even if it hurts their careers; on the other side, callous cynicism. Think about what it means to condemn health reform by comparing it to the Civil Rights Act. Who in modern America would say that Lyndon B Johnson did the wrong thing by pushing for racial equality? (Actually, we know who: the people at the Tea Party protest who hurled racial epithets at Democratic members of Congress on the eve of the vote.)\nAnd that cynicism has been the hallmark of the whole campaign against reform. Yes, a few conservative policy intellectuals, after making a show of thinking hard about the issues, claimed to be disturbed by the reform's fiscal implications \u2013 but were strangely unmoved by the clean bill of fiscal health from the Congressional budget office \u2013 or to want stronger action on costs \u2013 even though this reform does more to tackle healthcare costs than any previous legislation. For the most part, however, opponents of reform didn't even pretend to engage with the reality either of the existing healthcare system or of the moderate, centrist plan very close in outline to the reform Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts that Democrats were proposing.\nInstead, the emotional core of opposition to reform was blatant fear-mongering, unconstrained either by the facts or by any sense of decency.\nIt wasn't just the death panel smear \u2013 the myth that a euthanasia policy was in the offing. It was racial hate-mongering, like a piece in Investor's Business Daily declaring that health reform is \"affirmative action on steroids, deciding everything from who becomes a doctor to who gets treatment on the basis of skin colour\". It was wild claims about abortion funding. It was the insistence that there is something tyrannical about giving young working Americans the assurance that healthcare will be available when they need it, an assurance older citizens have enjoyed ever since Johnson pushed Medicare through over the howls of conservatives.\nAnd let's be clear: the campaign of fear hasn't been carried out by a radical fringe, unconnected to the Republican establishment. Politicians like Sarah Palin who was, let us remember, vice-presidential candidate, spread the death panel lie, and supposedly moderate politicians like Senator Chuck Grassley refused to say it was untrue. On the eve of the big vote, Republican members of Congress warned that \"freedom dies a little bit today\", and accused Democrats of \"totalitarian tactics\".\nWithout question, the campaign of fear was effective. Healthcare reform went from great popularity to widespread disapproval, although the numbers have been improving lately. But the question was, would it actually be enough to block reform?\nThe answer is no. It seems the Democrats have done it. The Senate version of health reform will become law, with an improved version coming through reconciliation. This is, of course, a political victory for Obama, and a triumph for Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. But it is also a victory for America's soul. In the end, a vicious, unprincipled fear offensive failed to block reform. This time, fear struck out.\n\u00a9 2010 New York Times News Service\n\u2022 This column quotes Newt Gingrich as saying that \"Lyndon Johnson shattered the Democratic party for 40 years\" by passing civil rights legislation, a quotation that originally appeared in the Washington Post. After this column was published, the Post reported that Gingrich said his comment referred to Johnson's Great Society policies, not to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n}}

{{This infographic, produced using Patchwork Nation data for AdAge , explores correlations between disease and socioeconomic status across the United States\nRegional differences in healthcare have been mapped time and again during the recent rise of online data-visualisation, but this effort, from the folks at AdAge, presents a new approach.\nThe infographic shows which disease is most prevalent within the population of each US county, and also highlights the socioeconomic status of each region, as defined by the Patchwork Nation project.\nIf you would like to browse a larger, interactive version of the map, you can find the original here.\nThe visualisation was produced by plotting data from 25,000 US household survey responses against Patchwork Nation's 'community types', showing both the geographical and and socioeconomic distribution of different diseases.\nClear regional patterns are immediately visible, such as the prominence of muscular degeneration across the south-west and the emergence of Restless Legs Syndrome as the dominant affliction in the north-east.\nPatchwork Nation, around which this map is designed, is a project funded by the Jefferson Institute that aims to explore America's regional socioeconomic idiosyncrasies.\nThe initiative seeks to go beyond typical red\/blue American politics and assigns each US county one of twelve 'community types', each based on various characteristics including income level, labour market statistics and racial composition.\nHousing stock, employment type and expenditure patterns are also incorporated into the classification process, and the labels given to different communities include \"Tractor Country\", \"Monied 'Burbs\" and \"Emptying Nests\".\nFor more information on its methodology, click here.\nPatchwork Nation provides an interesting new backdrop to plot data against - see what you can do with it and link to any examples below.\n\u2022 Who made this graphic?

{{Two Seattle-based healthcare companies are teaming up to help improve the way patients use digital tools to engage with care providers.\nSCI Solutions, a 19-year-old healthcare IT provider, has acquired DatStat, a Seattle startup that builds self-service patient health data collection technology and works with clients like Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, St. Jude Children\u2019s, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Kaiser Permanente, and the University of Washington.\nFinancial terms were not disclosed. DatStat\u2019s 21 employees will join SCI Solutions, which now counts 135 total employees.\n\u201cBy partnering with DatStat\u2019s team of professionals, SCI Solutions will eliminate the divide between today\u2019s complex health enterprises and individuals wanting to be personally engaged, understood and involved in their care,\u201d SCI Solutions Joel French said in a statement. \u201cThese software tools will foster sustainable growth for providers and improve health and satisfaction for participating patients.\u201d\nSCI Solutions develops patient scheduling, referral management and revenue cycle software for more than 13,000 physician practices and 1,000 hospitals. It will integrate DatStat into its platform, adding more than 100 medical centers that use DatStat\u2019s services for pre-visit preparation, secure messaging, visit summaries, and more. This is SCI Solutions\u2019 second acquisition; it bought Seattle-area company Clarity Health in 2015.\n\u201cLinking DatStat\u2019s consumer outreach platform with the national care coordination network of SCI Solutions will bring to market a more meaningful approach for how patients control and manage their health, while enabling providers to use a more modern way to attract and retain patients,\u201d DatStat CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Miller said in a statement.\nMiller co-founded DatStat more than two decades ago. The company originally focused on building software for researchers, but expanded after Miller helped her husband get through cancer treatment and realized inefficiencies with personalized patient care. You can read her story here.\nThere were 967 health services deals last year, which was down slightly from 2016 but deal value was up 146 percent to $175.2 billion, according to a PwC report. Another Seattle healthcare startup, C-SATS, was acquired by Johnson & Johnson on Thursday.\n}}

{{The healthcare sector has gotten off to a blistering start in 2019. However, the sector's nearly two-month-long rally has started to cool off in the last few trading sessions, perhaps representing a great entry point for long-term-oriented investors.\nWith this recent dip in mind, we asked three of our Motley Fool contributors which healthcare stocks they think are worth buying right now. They suggested Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC), MyoKardia (NASDAQ:MYOK), and Blueprint Medicines (NASDAQ:BPMC). Here's why.\nBuy the dip\nGeorge Budwell (Canopy Growth Corporation): After a red-hot start to the new year, Canada's largest pot company, Canopy Growth, has seen its shares retreat by nearly 6% since the release of its third-quarter earnings roughly a week ago. What's behind this sharp reversal?\nCanopy's shares are giving back some of their stately gains for two core reasons:\nToday, the company had to restate a key financial metric from last week's earnings report due to a minor spreadsheet error, sending its shares southward.\nCanopy's shares also appear to be reacting negatively to the news that a new fermentation technology might undermine dried flower and cannabis extract prices in the not-so-distant future.\nAll that being said, investors may want to look past these two headwinds to consider buying some shares on this pullback. After all, this top dog of the cannabis space hasn't been hit by any major scandals of its own, and this financial typo doesn't exactly change the company's underlying fundamentals or growth outlook. In addition, cannabis enthusiasts will probably remain loyal to naturally grown products in the long run -- even if cheaper, synthetic versions become widely available.\nGetting to the heart of the matter\nChuck Saletta (MyoKardia): When it comes to biotech research, much of the effort is focused on cancer and genetic issues like sickle cell disease or diabetes. Not nearly as much attention has been focused on the body's mechanical systems, like the heart. With its mission to \"discover, develop, and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and neglected rare cardiovascular diseases,\" MyoKardia is bringing much-needed research to that space.\nIts lead research candidate, Mavacamten, is in phase 3 clinical trials for a condition known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. People with this disease have had their heart muscle thicken, which makes it much more difficult for their heart to pump blood through their system. According to data from the National Institutes of Health, around 1 adult in 500 has some form of the disease.\nThat frequency makes it common enough so that a good treatment is certainly worth researching and discovering, yet by MyoKardia's own admission, the field has been fairly well neglected. Treatments are generally nonspecific like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers and don't directly address the core issues with the heart. Mavacamten is designed to affect the proteins in the heart that are at the root of the disease, providing hope for a true treatment.\nThe available preliminary data on the drug looks solid, giving reason to believe the treatment may ultimately be approved and effective for patients. Phase 3 results are expected in the second half of 2020, with the potential approval coming after that.\nWhat makes MyoKardia worth considering as a potential investment today is that its shares are trading near a 52-week low, giving investors more for their money than they would have gotten earlier. Its business is currently unprofitable, making it still a higher-risk investment, but that could change if Mavacamten delivers on its promise of a legitimate treatment for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nIt could be a big year for this biotech\nTodd Campbell (Blueprint Medicines): Blueprint Medicines is developing precision drugs targeting specific cancer mutations. It expects data that could support a filing for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its first drug, avapritinib, by midyear.\nAvapritinib inhibits KIT and PDGFRA, two protein kinases that can fuel gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and systematic mastocytosis (SM) in tens of thousands of patients.\nData from an early-stage SM trial showed an 83% overall response rate to avapritinib, and interim results in advanced GIST showed an overall response rate of 86%. Additional GIST data that's expected in the coming months could support a new drug application for PDGFRA mutation patients by June, while a separate trial could support a filing for use in third-line GIST patients in 2020. Results from a trial in advanced SM could clear the way for an application in that indication in 2020, too.\nBlueprint's also working on BLU-667, a possible treatment for RET-altered lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, and other solid-tumor cancers. An application for FDA approval of that drug could also be on tap in 2020.\nThere's no guarantee these drugs will pan out, but if they do, the company could have a shot at significant sales, because the market for existing, less-selective kinase inhibitors totals more than $25 billion per year.\nThe company hasn't licensed the rights to avapritinib yet, but it may not need to. It has $558 million in cash exiting September, and it can collect up to $965 million in milestone payments from a collaboration deal it has with Roche Holdings (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) on the development of up to five to-be-determined cancer drugs.\nOverall, precision, targeted treatment appears to be the future of medicine, and given the near-term catalysts, I think Blueprint Medicines is worth taking a chance on.\n}}

{{FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- The Air Force offers a wide and expanding range of telehealth services giving patients the opportunity to receive more efficient, convenient, and patient-centered care.\nTelehealth brings a range of services all working together to improve access. These include everything from mobile and electronic access to personal health information, to virtual appointments and enterprise imaging. These enhance every aspect of the patient experience, giving patients more information to make choices about their health.\nThe most used telehealth service is direct interaction with online systems like the patient portal and secure messaging. These tools offer features such as appointment reminders, prescription information, and allow patients to communicate via secure email messages with their healthcare team.\n\u201cHaving access to patients electronic health records and a way to quickly connect with providers allow real-time, daily interaction or interventions with their healthcare,\u201d said Lt. Col. Antonio Eppolito, chief of Air Force Telehealth. \u201cEverything for the patient is centralized and they have 24-hour access to their up to date EHR.\u201d\nTelehealth also means being able to replace some in-person visits with virtual appointments. Virtual Video Visits, or V3 appointments, are particularly popular and increasingly common form of virtual appointments. These appointments are scheduled just like an in-person visit and done via a secured video teleconference at a military treatment facility. A coordinator remains with the patient to measure vitals and helps connect with the provider located at another MTF.\n\u201cThe goal of these V3 appointments is it connect patients with a specialist they might not otherwise have access to,\u201d said Eppolito. \u201cTelehealth services allow patients to access such specialty care as genetic counseling, nutrition therapy, and mental health services.\u201d\nAnother area of telehealth that is often overlooked is enterprise imaging. Enterprise imaging involves taking a diagnostic quality image, like a radiology exam, that is done in one place, and interpreted by a specialist who is at another location.\n\u201cIn the areas of tele-radiology, tele-cardiology, tele-pathology, and tele-endoscopy, we are doing enterprise imaging,\u201d said Eppolito. \u201cAs a result, the primary care provider is able to get specialty consultation and interpretation on a diagnostic image, even though the specialist is not physically in the same facility. This means the patient is able to get a quicker and complete diagnosis, and can pull up the report for future reference anywhere in the world.\u201d\nTelehealth also plays an important role in maintaining Airmen readiness. Having the ability to reach the care they need ensures that Airmen can address health concerns much quicker.\n\u201cTelehealth is vital to Airmen readiness since they can reach their primary care provider and get the treatment they need without much a delay,\u201d said Eppolito. \u201cPhysicians in the U.S. can reach Airmen when they are in a deployed setting, outside of in-garrison medical facilities. Having access to real-time specialty care is valuable to maintaining readiness.\u201d\n}}

{{DENVER \u2014 It\u2019s one of the most difficult, most expensive decisions parents have to make: where to find childcare. And it\u2019s tougher than ever before in Colorado because the state has a massive shortage of daycare providers and some of the highest costs in the country .\nThe moment Maggie Heatherman, a Stapleton mother, found out she was pregnant, one of her first thoughts was who would care for the most important thing in her life when she goes back to work.\n\u201cResearch shows the first couple of years of life are so instrumental in development,\u201d said Heatherman, who immediately started looking for a nanny. \"When I first started looking, it's crazy how expensive it is. We\u2019re talking $18 to $20 an hour, at a minimum.\"\nPost sticker shock, she said, the real panic set in, after she realized she might not find someone in time.\n\"Until you experience it, you have no idea what it's like to try to find care,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s a fragmented marketplace, so there is no one-stop-shop to figure everything out, unfortunately.\u201d\nBooming Population Leads to Shortage\nThe childcare challenge in Colorado has become increasingly difficult, in part, because of the state\u2019s booming population.\nWhile the State offers a new childcare ratings and referral agency called Colorado Shines to help match parents with licensed providers, often those providers simply don\u2019t have enough space, especially for infants and toddlers.\n\u201cThere really are not enough slots at this time in licensed care,\" said Erin Mewhinney, the Division Director of Early Care and Learning for the Colorado Department of Human Services. \u201cWe certainly have more slots over the last ten years than we did ten years ago, but we have a vastly larger population, and it\u2019s just not keeping up.\u201d\nAt The Goddard School in Parker, the wait list for the infant room is one year long, and Dan King, the owner, tells parents to get on the wait list at conception.\n\u201cSo, as soon as you know you\u2019re pregnant, get on the wait list,\u201d said Dan King, who said would-be parents frequently contact him before they have even conceived. \u201cThat\u2019s happened numerous times, actually. You want to plan ahead.\u201d\nColorado Ranks Among Most Expensive For Childcare\nWhen parents can find a slot, the question remains can they afford it? Colorado consistently ranks among the most expensive states for licensed childcare . From 2007-2014, daycare rates for infants shot up 21 percent in Colorado, while incomes only went up 12 percent, according to a 2016 report by the Colorado Children\u2019s Campaign.\nOn average, according to a 2016 Child Care Aware Report , the annual cost for child care centers is $14,950 a year for infants and $11,089 for a 4-year-old. In-Home daycare is less expensive, but still costs $9,620 for infants and $8,626 for a 4-year-old.\nAs a result of the high costs and low availability, Mewhinney said, more parents are turning to friends, neighbors and relatives to fill the gap, leading to other concerns.\n\"We are very concerned when we hear of parents, for instance, leaving children in the care of older siblings pulling siblings out of school to watch their younger siblings,\" said Mewhinney. \u201cWhen parents or caregivers cannot find formal care, we do often see neglect cases pop up from them.\u201d\n\u201cWhen parents or caregivers cannot find formal care, we do often see neglect cases pop up from them.\u201d\nNanny Shares Will Soon Be Legal\nSo, what can parents faced with low supply and high prices do?\n\"Nanny shares. Absolutely a nanny share,\" said Maggie Broadrick, the owner of Kiddie Up Nannies , who has been helping Colorado families find childcare for the last seven years. \u201cThe biggest frustration for parents would be affordability. Nanny share is becoming super popular for that reason.\u201d\nBroadrick said families with similar needs will work together to split the cost, making a nanny about the same price as a child care center.\nTechnically, however, Nanny Shares were not legal under Colorado law, which did not allow an unlicensed provider to care for more than two unrelated children. In March, Governor Hickenlooper signed a new law increasing the number of unrelated children a caregiver can watch without a DHS license for four, but no more than two of them can be younger than 2 years old. The new law takes effect this summer.\nThe High-Tech Hunt For Childcare\nMany parents are also using apps and websites in a high-tech hunt for childcare, including companies such as Urban Sitter, Sitter.me and Care.com .\nSome parents have turned to childcare cooperatives, in which neighborhood moms trade free babysitting duties.\n\"Apps and online sources are really great resources, but it's important for families to know they're going to have a lot of legwork to do,\" said Broadrick, \u201cAnd they need to do their due diligence to check people out.\u201d\nMaggie Heatherman found that out the hard way, doing ten hours of research a week trying to find a nanny.\n\"There's just so many places to look - there's different websites, different nanny organizations, different Facebook groups,\" said Heatherman, whose son, Jack, is now three months old. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to find something in time.\u201d\nShe did find a Nanny Share at the last minute, but that nanny just turned in her two-week\u2019s notice, and Heatherman has to start the process from scratch.\n\u201cEspecially with how emotional and overwhelmed you are just with having a new baby the challenge of finding childcare is so difficult,\" said Heatherman.\nColorado Shines Offers these tips for finding quality childcare.\nHow does your county compare in child care costs?

{{Fewer pregnant teens, fewer abortions, fewer unwed mothers, fewer single-parent families on welfare, more balanced state budgets. Sounds like a set of goals that should be common ground for anyone who cares about America\u2019s future, right?\nApparently not. Fox News, Breitbart and other right-leaning news outlets showed their non-patriotic non-loyalty to the Red, White and Blue this week by assaulting a Washington state program that helps to make these broadly American objectives a reality.\nAdvertisement:\nPublic-private partnership leads by building on global model, U.S. research.\nIn King County, home of Seattle, an innovative public-private partnership brings adolescent health services to youth where they are \u2014 in schools. Since the top reason girls drop out of high school is pregnancy, on-site clinics in Seattle high schools have long included family planning services, and Washington voters have long defended teen access to care, whether or not young people have supportive parental adults they can turn to for help.\nSince 2010, a model program developed by Neighborcare Health and adopted by other primary care providers has applied \u201cmedical best practices\u201d shown in Missouri and Colorado to dramatically decrease teen pregnancy. This includes on-site provision of top-tier IUDs and implants that are endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC as the first line of contraception for sexually active teens.\nSchool-based clinics that provide reproductive healthcare have been around for a quarter of a century and span the globe from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to Cape Town, South Africa. The Washington program has backing from public health authorities and educators and state law. But that hasn\u2019t prevented a chorus of inane formulaic screeching about mythical 11-year-old sixth-graders sneaking behind the backs of their otherwise doting parents to get \u201cdangerous\u201d IUDs, \u201cgynecological procedures\u201d and \u201cinvasive contraceptives\u201d from unqualified government bureaucrats.\nReligious right fabricates 11-year-old mascot\nBy design, media hype generated by Fox and similar outlets requires little basis in reality. (If only the story had broken in June, the Fox lineup could have included Bristol Palin touting the virtues of abstinence, which works \u2014 don\u2019t you know \u2014 100 percent of the time.)\nAdvertisement:\nConservative commentators appear not to care that their mascot, the 11-year-old IUD seeker, hasn\u2019t shown up once during the past five years of service. Nor do they care that real teens who do exist have received the best family planning care available, stacking the odds in favor of their education, their dreams and their future families. Rather, commentators, including Penny Nance from the fundamentalist Christian group Concerned Women for America, used misleading shock headlines as an opening to rant against government overreach and parent rights.\nMeanwhile, in the real world ...\nIn reality, the highly trained professionals in Seattle\u2019s school-based clinics include parents where possible. In an article published this spring, one provider told a University of Washington researcher, \u201cWe decided we should probably focus on parents in implementing the services and doing LARCs [long acting reversible contraceptives] with students who really want to do it, and who are well educated about it, and also with the support of their families.\u201d Clinicians routinely ask students if they have told their parents about a visit, when they think they might tell their parents, and how the clinic can support them in that process, even facilitating family discussions\nBut as in half of American states, Washington allows adolescents to seek reproductive healthcare independently, recognizing that sometimes parents are too addicted, mentally ill, abusive or estranged for teens to feel safe involving them. With young teens, conversations about sex and reproductive health can be particularly delicate. The younger the teen, the more she likely needs parental support, but also the more likely any sexual activity is actually sexual abuse. If Fox\u2019s mythical 11-year-old were to seek an IUD alone, her presence at the clinic would raise red flags for all around her, and any provider or educator with evidence of sexual abuse would be in a mandatory reporting situation with a legal obligation to contact authorities. Rather than estranging young children from caring, protective parents, the goal is to create an additional safety net for children who may be sexually abused, so that they can be identified and helped.\nAdvertisement:\nNonetheless, for some Bible-believing fundamentalists, Washington\u2019s consent law is proof positive that parent rights are under threat. Given that the Bible endorses the Iron Age view that children are literally chattel belonging to their fathers \u2014 that parents have the right to sell their children into slavery, give them in marriage, send them into wars, or even sacrifice them \u2014 they may be right. Usually the interests of parents and children align, but not always. When they don\u2019t, fundamentalist Christians seeking \u201creligious freedom\u201d have shown a distressing willingness to put parent rights above child wellbeing, even to the point of medical neglect and death.\nObsessive obstructionism\nAmerica\u2019s epidemic of teen moms mired in poverty is no accident. In state after state, conservative politicians in the thrall of the religious right have obstructed or destroyed programs that drive down unwanted pregnancy and abortion and welfare dependency, including a much touted Colorado program during which teen pregnancy dropped by 40 percent.\nAdvertisement:\nWhy?\nSex columnist Dan Savage, in an article titled \u201cRepublicans in Colorado Vote for More Abortions,\u201d says the pattern points to only one conclusion:\nConservatives will drive up the abortion rate and happily kill all the babies if doing so will stop people\u2014young people, poor people, unmarried people, gay people\u2014from enjoying\"consequence-free sex.\" Because it's sex that they hate. It's sex for pleasure that they hate. They hate that kind of sex more than they hate abortion, teen moms, and welfare spending combined. [revision in original]\nCommentator Amanda Marcotte concurs, \u201cConservatives are willing \u2014 eager, even \u2014 to keep the teen pregnancy rate sky high on the slim hope that doing so might scare someone, sometime out of having sex.\u201d\nAdvertisement:\nIt\u2019s getting hard to come up with an alternative hypothesis. But if recent advances in queer rights and marriage equality are any indicator, the general public is finding conservative Christianity\u2019s obsession with traditional patriarchal privilege and sexual entitlement increasingly wearisome and offensive. That includes the obsession controlling who has sex with whom.\nThe high human cost of unsought pregnancy\nRegrettably, the price for conservative Christianity\u2019s obsessive obstructionism largely gets paid, not by old white men with a death grip on tradition, but by young brown women and their children. In the absence of comprehensive sex ed and excellent accessible contraception, early, unsought pregnancy fuels high-school dropouts, poverty, deteriorating public health, domestic violence and the need for abortion. It stretches family budgets and public resources to the breaking point and beyond.\nYoung women and men who can finish their education and get settled before launching into parenthood are more likely to prosper and thrive \u2014 and so are their children, and even their grandchildren. But until now, unsought pregnancy in the U.S. has been a tough challenge to solve. Half of U.S pregnancies are unintended. Among single women under the age of 30, that rises to 70 percent, and among teens it is over 80 percent. For more than a generation, America\u2019s teen pregnancy rate, the highest in the developed world, has been a national disgrace.\nAdvertisement:\nA breakthrough\nNow, finally, successes in Missouri and Colorado point to a path forward, which Seattle\u2019s Neighborcare has adapted for school-based clinics. The key appears to be a technology shift from every-day and every-time birth control methods to long-acting error-free technologies for all who want them, made accessible via updated medical care and counseling.\nThe magic formula includes:\n\u201cFit and forget\u201d contraceptives. State-of-the-art IUDs and implants eliminate the challenge of every-day or every-time birth control methods, making pregnancy opt in rather than opt out. Sexually active teens relying on the pill have an annual pregnancy rate of over 1 in 10. Those relying on condoms or abstinence vows do even worse. By contrast, the best IUDs and implants drop the pregnancy risk below 1 in 500, while offering a quick return to normal fertility whenever a young woman feels ready. In tech terms, they toggle the default setting to pregnancy off until a woman wants it on.\nState-of-the-art IUDs and implants eliminate the challenge of every-day or every-time birth control methods, making pregnancy opt in rather than opt out.

Before Obamacare, upfront costs approaching $1,000 put top tier birth control out of reach for many young women. Now, thanks to the contraceptive mandate, which requires that preventive care be covered in full, more young women can obtain the method they want without any cost barrier.

After a defective IUD injured women in the 1970s, American doctors and women fell back on the pill, and long-acting contraception virtually disappeared from the U.S. market. But in countries that never adopted the defective technology, many women transitioned to IUDs and then implants as they became available. Decades of evidence from around the world now show that modern IUDs and implants are safer for most women than any other form of contraception (or none at all); and they are healthy for teens, who often have the hardest time using every-day or every-time methods or episodic abstinence consistently. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated practice recommendations and encouraged these methods for sexually active teens. A nonprofit called UpstreamUSA provides intensive trainings to help clinical teams (from receptionist to doctor to billing office) retool so that they can offer the full range of contraceptive options.\nAfter a defective IUD injured women in the 1970s, American doctors and women fell back on the pill, and long-acting contraception virtually disappeared from the U.S. market.

Improved contraceptive counseling. When a young woman seeks birth control, providers routinely ask about when she would like to get pregnant and then chart the answer, a practice often called one key question. This opens up a conversation about broader life goals and allows the provider to present birth control options in the order most likely to help the young woman fulfill her intentions. If she has mixed feelings, a technique called motivational interviewing offers a structure tool for tapping her values and aspirations.\nWhen a young woman seeks birth control, providers routinely ask about when she would like to get pregnant and then chart the answer, a practice often called one key question.

Better integration of family planning into other social services . Since childbearing affects every aspect of health and wellbeing, doctors now are moving to incorporate family planning conversations in other kinds of medical services. This includes primary care, chronic disease management, adolescent medicine, sports medicine, pre-natal care, labor and delivery, and mental health counseling. School-based care that meets students on their home turf integrates services even further. The key is identifying (or creating) natural points of contact between young people and the healthcare system and then ensuring good information flow and services at those critical junctures.\n.

Social network effects. As young women discover that they don\u2019t have to rely on every-day or every-time birth control methods (and can safely choose how often to have a period!), many are telling their friends. The diffusion of long-acting contraceptives has been rapid, for example, among young athletes who value the lifestyle and health benefits of lighter, less frequent menstruation. Popular media have also spread the word about bonus health benefits and the peace of mind that \u201cfit and forget\u201d contraceptives can offer busy women who are juggling work and family.\nAll of these steps are practical refinements of prior medical practices. But to read the conservative press one might think they were part of a newly unearthed nefarious plot to increase teen promiscuity and drive a wedge between parents and young adults. No credible evidence exists to support either of these fears \u2014 but, then again, who needs evidence when rabbit-hole reasoning will suffice.\nAdvertisement:\nIn contrast to conservative detractors, public health advocates are thrilled with the changes because unplanned pregnancies increase complications for mother and baby. So are educators, because almost a third of girls who drop out of school say they did so due to parenthood. So are child development specialists, because children who come into the world when parents feel ready are less likely to suffer adverse events that literally damage the developing brain. Families do best when young people get to finish growing up before becoming parents and when babies are born to parents who feel ready to kiss their toes.\nIf we really care about babies and teens and all the fabulous stages of childhood in between, perhaps it\u2019s time to meet conservative outrage with some compassion-driven outrage of our own!\nHow long will we taxpayers fund health classes that treat sex-negative \u201clicked lollypop\u201d slut shaming like legitimate birth control for teens?\nHow long will we as voters let grandstanding liars pretend that modern teens are degenerate and different -- that teens in the 1950s and \u201860s (and every decade before or since) didn\u2019t have sex before marriage?\nHow long will we let religious fundamentalists in high places deny our sons and daughters and nieces and nephews and vulnerable young neighbors critical information and medical care that could help them manage their fertility \u2014 and then deny them abortions when they fail?\nHow long will surprise pregnancy that is utterly preventable keep shattering youthful dreams and hopes?\nI, for one, am proud to live in Washington. In Washington we take care of our teens when their parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t. In Washington, generations of voters have fiercely defended the legal right of young people to seek whatever help they may need. In Washington brave nonprofits provide the state-of-the-art care even when it creates an uncomfortable media ruckus. In Washington, taxpayers and parents and neighbors and educators and clinicians together form the village that helps young people to care for themselves and graduate and pursue their dreams.\n}}

{{Margins matter. The more National Healthcare (AMEX: NHC) keeps of each buck it earns in revenue, the more money it has to invest in growth, fund new strategic plans, or (gasp!) distribute to shareholders. Healthy margins often separate pretenders from the best stocks in the market. That's why we check up on margins at least once a quarter in this series. I'm looking for the absolute numbers, so I can compare them to current and potential competitors, and any trend that may tell me how strong National Healthcare's competitive position could be.\nHere's the current margin snapshot for National Healthcare over the trailing 12 months: Gross margin is 42.5%, while operating margin is 8.7% and net margin is 7.8%.\nUnfortunately, a look at the most recent numbers doesn't tell us much about where National Healthcare has been, or where it's going. A company with rising gross and operating margins often fuels its growth by increasing demand for its products. If it sells more units while keeping costs in check, its profitability increases. Conversely, a company with gross margins that inch downward over time is often losing out to competition, and possibly engaging in a race to the bottom on prices. If it can't make up for this problem by cutting costs -- and most companies can't -- then both the business and its shares face a decidedly bleak outlook.\nOf course, over the short term, the kind of economic shocks we recently experienced can drastically affect a company's profitability. That's why I like to look at five fiscal years' worth of margins, along with the results for the trailing 12 months, the last fiscal year, and last fiscal quarter (LFQ). You can't always reach a hard conclusion about your company's health, but you can better understand what to expect, and what to watch.\nHere's the margin picture for National Healthcare over the past few years.\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. Dollar amounts in millions. FY = fiscal year. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nBecause of seasonality in some businesses, the numbers for the last period on the right -- the TTM figures -- aren't always comparable to the FY results preceding them. To compare quarterly margins to their prior-year levels, consult this chart.\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. Dollar amounts in millions. FQ = fiscal quarter.\nHere's how the stats break down:\nOver the past five years, gross margin peaked at 43.9% and averaged 43.4%. Operating margin peaked at 10.3% and averaged 7.2%. Net margin peaked at 8.5% and averaged 7.2%.\nTTM gross margin is 42.5%, 90 basis points worse than the five-year average. TTM operating margin is 8.7%, 150 basis points better than the five-year average.

That, in any event, has been the tack of opponents of single-payer healthcare, also called improved \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d.\n\u201c[W]e got to get away from these falsehoods and start talking about the truth \u2026\u201d opined billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on CNBC last June, while contending that single-payer healthcare was economically infeasible. \u201cI think a lot of the analysis has shown it\u2019s unaffordable,\u201d claimed Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, last summer, quoted by Kaiser Health News.\nYet casting Medicare-for-all as an economic impossibility is becoming a sisyphean pursuit: a slew of studies \u2013 including one released just the other week \u2013 are confirming that, yes, we can afford real universal healthcare in America. But if that\u2019s the case, why haven\u2019t we already achieved it? Well, the real stumbling block is not that single-payer advocates\u2019 arithmetic is poor, it\u2019s that American politics are dominated by the rich.\nStill, the numbers matter. On 30 November, a team of economists with the Political Economy Research Institute (Peri) at the University of Amherst published a highly credible, nearly 200-page economic analysis of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer bill. The Peri study received essentially none of the media coverage lathered on the last such analysis \u2013 a flawed piece of work published by the conservative Mercatus Center last summer. But here\u2019s the funny thing: though these two analyses came from economists from opposite ends of the political spectrum, they shared a similar finding: single-payer would reduce our nation\u2019s healthcare spending bill by trillions of dollars over a decade (around $2tn and $5tn, respectively).\nThe real stumbling block is not that single-payer advocates' arithmetic is poor, it's that American politics are dominated by the rich.\nThe numbers are big, but they shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Yes, single-payer imposes some new costs: when people don\u2019t have to worry about ruinous medical bills or ravenous debt collectors, they tend to use more healthcare, increasing costs. But such rises in utilization are likely to be modest (even more modest than these analyses predict). There are only so many doctors and hospital beds, which limits theorized surges in utilization. Anyway, there are hundreds of billions in potential savings in moving to single-payer, such as slimming down on the massive administrative bloat of the privatized American healthcare system and bringing down our sky-high drug prices.\nGoing back decades, studies have found that, at worst, these costs and savings will balance out under a Canadian-style single-payer reform. \u201cIn Canada, each provincial plan provides for universal insurance coverage with no deductibles or copayments, controls on provider reimbursement, and administration by a single, public payer,\u201d the United States General Accounting Office noted in an analysis of a single-payer bill way back in 1992. \u201cWe found that if these features were applied in the United States, the administrative savings could offset the added costs.\u201d\nIn a review of the Peri study that I co-authored with Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler at the City University of New York, we commended the robustness of the team\u2019s much-needed and highly thorough analysis, while offering differing opinions on some of the specific assumptions. We also contended that it would be prudent to cautiously assume that overall healthcare spending would remain roughly stable (rather than fall) shortly after implementation.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: a single-payer system allows cost growth to be directly controlled over time in a way that\u2019s not possible with a privatized system. So even if a Medicare-for-all system only allows us to keep overall healthcare spending where it is today (as a proportion of the US economy), a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation using figures from the National Health Expenditures accounts shows that it would still save some $2tn over a decade.\nMedicare for All policy has become politics' sticking point Read more\nTo be clear, even as we reduce overall health spending by trillions, new taxes will be needed to replace most of the private spending \u2013 eg premiums, copays, and deductibles \u2013 that suddenly and permanently evaporate. To this end, the Peri analysis proposes a sensible mix of taxes, including payroll taxes paid by businesses, a sales tax on non-essentials, and a wealth tax on the richest among us. It would also treat capital gains like ordinary income. In exchange, we would have a healthcare system that covers everyone in the nation, without copays or deductibles, with comprehensive benefits, with no insurance networks or interruptions in coverage \u2013 and a permanent end to the soul-sucking hassle of medical bills.\nThere is another benefit of this system, albeit one that helps explain why we haven\u2019t achieved it yet. A more progressive system of healthcare financing can, over time, reduce inequalities not only in health, but in wealth, helping to close our nation\u2019s disastrous economic divide. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that billionaires don\u2019t much like it. Nor is it unexpected that the corporate behemoths that have the most to lose are already sharpening their swords, pouring cash into a new anti-single-payer lobbying group that, as the Intercept recently reported, is maneuvering to \u201cinfluence Democratic party messaging and stymie the momentum toward achieving universal health care coverage\u201d.\nSo as important as rigorous analyses and funding proposals are, we miss the forest from the trees if we see this mainly as a fight among policy wonks or dueling funding proposals. This is a struggle against the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d, as Franklin D Roosevelt once termed them, of our day \u2013 and for the interests of ordinary working people. Good numbers do not a political movement make.\n}}

{{The advent of online health insurance system in Nigeria by AVON HMO promises to change the Nigerian health sector for good. Martins Ifijeh writes\nUkiri\nDespite the enormous benefits of health insurance to a society, especially to low income countries where healthcare is still being paid from out-of-pocket, there remains apathy in accessing the healthcare scheme, which was designed to take medical financial burden out of the citizens.\nFor Nigeria, healthcare players say only about four per cent of Nigerians are on health insurance even though legislations have been made to encourage Nigerians and stakeholders to take advantage of the system, which ordinarily should help provide better healthcare experience.\nThe birthing of several Health Management Organisations (HMO) in the country has also not helped in increasing the number of Nigerians and organisations who should key into any health insurance plan.\nBut this concern is not a challenge for developed nations like the United States and Britain due to various innovations and policies that have helped in making their citizens accept the scheme. For instance, there are adequate policy frameworks to encourage organisations to provide health insurance for their workers. Same for families. Also, innovations like the use of social media has been a persuasive force and a more convenient way, as this has also helped them register for health plans and manage their subscriptions even in the comfort of their homes.\nWhile the Nigerian government has a law in place mandating organisations with more than 10 employees to provide health insurance for their staff, lack of implementation of the law has unfortunately made it a toothless law, leaving the country with only an option to, like in U.S. and UK, provide convenient platforms for registering and managing health plans with a click away from their phones and computers, since already, 97 million Nigerians are already internet users, with majority spending more time on the internet than anywhere else.\nIt is in achieving this, and revolutionalising the country\u2019s healthcare system, that AVON HMO is introducing the online healthcare platform, first of its kind in Nigeria, so as to savage the situation and then bring more information about health insurance to Nigerians even in their homes and on the go.\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer of the HMO, Mrs. Adesimbo Ukiri, during the launch of the online platform recently in Lagos, said the burden of various diseases in the country must be reduced through decisive measures, one of which is the introduction of AVON HMO Online in Nigeria for quick, easy access to affordable healthcare, adding that, since more Nigerians were internet users, the online platform would help them take charge of their health even when they are not prepared financially for treatment should the case arise.\nShe said in Nigeria, most expensive treatments are not covered by health insurance, leaving the citizens at the mercy of the disease, as this has somewhat increased the burden and prevalence of diseases in the country and in other low income countries, as against countries where health insurance is much embraced.\nOn how the online platform works, Ukiri said with an internet enabled phone, tablet or computers, one can log into AVON HMO website and register for one of the health plans within five minutes.\nShe said: \u201cMany people today live life on the go and expect often immediacy. As the focus of Avon HMO remains on our customers, we constantly think of ways to make their lives easier and access to healthcare simpler. We embraced technology and chose to update our website so that people can subscribe to a health plan whenever and wherever they are, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\u201cPeople who visit our website now can buy one of health plan for themselves or their families\u2019 in the same way they shop for products and services online. Prospective members are just a few clicks away from subscribing to their preferred plans and this is extremely exciting.\n\u201cWith health plans starting as low as N15,000 per year, we intend to bring quality service more to the people through the online platform. Subscription to an Avon HMO plan means that whenever a covered ill health or accident occurs, the state of one\u2019s finances won\u2019t matter as Avon HMO oversees the healthcare service delivery and foots the bill. By giving people the ability to buy and subscribe online via mobile phones and other devices, we are bringing convenient and affordable healthcare services to everyone.\u201d\nUkiri said that since its entry into the health insurance space in 2013, Avon HMO continues to set the insurance industry alight with its customer-centric and innovative products, services and initiatives.\nHer words: \u201cWe have already developed a good relationship with hospitals we work with because we keep to our words; we pay within the timeline agreed. If you have somebody who is in a lower cost plan and the condition becomes critical, we will get you the best consultant in that field just because what you paid in the premium is relatively low dose not entail we have to give you the least cost doctor. We give you the specialist that has the experience to manage your case.\u201d\nThe MD said they also work with the government tertiary institutions because that is where most of the exposed and experienced consultants are.\nOn her part, the Managing Director, Integrated Medical Centre, Dr. Damilola Familoni, said while she was away in the U.S. and surfing through her Instagram page, she was surprised to see AVON HMO now on Instagram with health tips and need for people to subscribe to health insurance.\n\u201cSocial media and websites are a great way to breaking into the health insurance market in Nigeria where apathy still persists,\u201d she added.\n}}

{{The need for reinventing the health system has never before been more urgent\nTOKYO , April 5, 2018 \/PRNewswire\/ -- The Japanese healthcare system is a shining example of strength and resilience. At an average lifespan of 84 years, the Japanese society is not only the healthiest but also the \"oldest\" in the world. However, the challenges presented by an ageing population pose serious threats to the sustainability of the Japanese health system. Frost & Sullivan's recent research, Strategic Direction for Healthcare Reform in Japan , outlines underlying social challenges and constraints hindering Japan's progress towards health system modernisation and provides strategic insights.\nFor further information on this analysis, please visit:\nResource consumption in the Japanese healthcare system is disproportionately high compared to other OECD countries. Japan spends 11.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare, which equates to $4,519 in per capita healthcare spending, less than half of the US. At this level of spending, the country provisions hospital care for almost 2% of its population every day.\nWhile the idea of a government taking full responsibility of its people's health and wellbeing is admirable, its long-term sustainability is questionable. By 2025, 30% of the Japanese population will be older than 65. This impacts country productivity and the ability to contribute to social spending negatively, in addition to having a significant positive impact on healthcare costs and service demand. There are over 100,000 general practitioner (GP) clinics across the country, yet 60% of hospital revenue is generated by out-patient services as industry regulations feed a fee-for-service model for reimbursements.\nWhile Japan is the second-largest market for pharmaceuticals and medical technology products globally with an increasing demand for high-tech health services, the digitalisation of healthcare services has been slow. The penetration of electronic medical records (EMRs) is limited to large hospitals (greater than 600 beds) and there is poor information sharing outside the hospital. As a result, quality and continuity of care suffer greatly and concepts like care management and team-based care are virtually non-existent.\nMuch like any other country's policy reform, Japan has lagged behind technology evolution and consumer maturity. The reforms instituted so far can provide only incremental benefits. Japan needs to redesign its health system to meet the needs of the future. It needs to critically analyse what \"value\" means to healthcare stakeholders in Japan and then align policies and health system metrics. This will involve evolution of care delivery models, payment mechanisms and the roles of both physicians and patients. It will create room for outcomes-based contracts from pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, telehealth and home monitoring-based care delivery models, and alternative payers, such as private insurers.\nStrategic Direction for Healthcare Reform in Japan is part of Frost & Sullivan's Global Digital Health Growth Partnership Services program.\nAbout Frost & Sullivan\nFrost & Sullivan , the Growth Partnership Company , works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.

{{Senators who have refused to cosponsor bills that would reshape the nation\u2019s ailing healthcare system have received an average of $14,000 to $24,000 more in campaign contributions from the nation\u2019s biggest healthcare companies than lawmakers who have signed on as sponsors of one of three major reform bills, according to a MapLight analysis.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nThe three bills\u2013one that would create universal healthcare by offering Medicare for all, one that would offer Medicare to people older than 50, and one that would allow Americans to buy health insurance through Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program\u2013have been opposed by the health industry. A January Kaiser Family Foundation poll found almost three in four Americans think the government should do more to help people obtain health insurance. The typical American family pays annual premiums of $19,616 for healthcare\u2013almost one-third of the median U.S. household income. One in four Americans reported that they didn\u2019t seek medical treatment because of potential costs, according to a 2017 Bankrate survey. Yet the MapLight analysis highlights the political difficulty of reforming the health industry, which accounts for more than one-fifth of the nation\u2019s $20 trillion economy. The 73 senators who have declined to cosponsor one of the three bills received a total of almost $4.3 million from the nation\u2019s 10 largest healthcare companies between 2013 and 2018. During the same period, the 23 lawmakers who support a measure allowing Americans to buy health insurance through Medicaid reported contributions that totalled $765,000 from the healthcare giants, which have market capitalizations that cumulatively approach $2 trillion. \u201cWe have a structure that frankly works for most Americans,\u201d Charles Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, an investor-owned trade organization, told the New York Times. \u201cLet\u2019s make it work for all Americans. We reject the notion that we need to turn the whole apple cart over and start all over again.\u201d The Washington, D.C.-based federation gave almost $1.2 million to federal campaigns during the six-year period. Medicare for all, money for few\nadvertisement\nThe least-popular alternative in terms of cosponsors, a universal coverage plan that would essentially guarantee coverage to every American, is also one of the most-discussed potential reforms by 2020 candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who entered the race on Feb. 19, attracted 16 cosponsors with his 2017 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill. The co-sponsors received $678,297 during the six-year period. Among Medicare for All cosponsors, Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat running for the 2020 nod, received more than $120,000 from the 10 largest healthcare companies, including $45,450 from Merck & Co., which is based in Booker\u2019s home state. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat also running for president, reported almost $117,000 in donations from the companies. More than $97,000 of her total came from Pfizer Inc., which is based in New York City. At the other end of the scale, Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, reported only $100 in total contributions from the healthcare companies. Merkley received four $25 donations in 2017 from an Abbott Laboratories employee in his home state. Among lawmakers who haven\u2019t signed on to any of the reform bills, Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, received $188,000 from the 10 largest healthcare companies. Todd Young, R-Ind., reported getting $187,250, and Pat Casey, a Pennsylvania Republican, received more than $182,000. Sanders has said he expects to sponsor another Medicare for All bill during the current session of Congress. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University estimated that his measure would cost $32 trillion over a 10-year period; Sanders claimed that the study, which was funded by an organization that\u2019s been supported by billionaire libertarian brothers Charles and David Koch, reflected potential savings of $2 trillion. The Vermont independent reported $1,273 in contributions from the healthcare companies and their employees for his Senate campaigns over the last six years.\nadvertisement\nMedicare at 50 Cosponsors of a measure introduced by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, received an average that was slightly greater than the cosponsors of the Medicare for All proposal. The Stabenow bill would allow people between the ages of 50 and 64 to buy into the $583 billion Medicare program. The Stabenow bill\u2019s 21 cosponsors got more than $914,000 from the 10 largest healthcare companies and their employees over the six-year period. Eleven senators have signed on as cosponsors of both the Sanders and Stabenow bill, including Booker, Gillibrand, and Merkley. The other senators who have endorsed both plans are Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; and Edward Markey, D-Mass. The largest donor among the big companies to all senators was Pfizer, which gave $214,825 to the Stabenow bill\u2019s cosponsors. UnitedHealth Group, the Minnetonka, Minn.-based health insurer, gave more than $125,000 to cosponsors including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who\u2019s running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Klobuchar received more than $27,000 from the insurance giant. The Stabenow measure is similar to plans that were discussed during the 2009 debate over former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Early drafts of the act would have allowed a \u201cpublic option,\u201d or a government health insurance plan. The public option, however, was rejected by former Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who currently works as a lobbyist for ZTE, a Chinese telecom conglomerate that\u2019s been sanctioned by the U.S. government for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Medicaid public option\nadvertisement\nA more expansive proposal from Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, would allow all Americans to purchase health insurance through Medicaid, the $577 billion state-federal partnership providing healthcare for the poor and disabled. Because states share the program costs with the federal government, Schatz\u2019s proposal is the most popular of the three measures, garnering 22 cosponsors. Depending upon the generosity of legislators, Medicaid expenses make up between 13.9 percent of a state\u2019s budget (Wyoming) and 38 percent (Missouri). Medicaid is also seen as a lower-cost alternative to Medicare; physicians receive roughly 72 percent of Medicare rates when they treat Medicaid patients, according to a 2017 Urban Institute study. Only two senators are cosponsoring the Schatz bill and not the other two alternatives: Sens. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, and Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat. Schatz, who introduced the bill on Feb. 14 after an unsuccessful attempt to pass the legislation in 2017, is also a cosponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal. Methodology: MapLight analysis includes 10 largest healthcare companies by NASDAQ market capitalization as of Feb. 25, 2019: Johnson & Johnson ($365.7 billion); UnitedHealth Group Inc. ($260.2 billion); Pfizer Inc. ($245.1 billion); Merck & Co. ($207.5 billion); Abbott Laboratories ($132.2 billion); Eli Lilly and Co. ($129.7 billion); Medtronic plc ($123.9 billion); AbbVie Inc. ($121.6 billion); 3M Company ($120.3 billion); and Amgen Inc. ($120 billion). Contribution figures include donations to campaigns for former Sen.

{{While it most certainly wasn't a great week to be a turkey it was once again a great couple of days to be an investor in the healthcare space. Several of the exchange-traded funds that focus on the sector provided their investors with terrific returns that far outpaced the S&P 500 last week. One fund in particular, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEMKT:XBI), performed exceptionally well, as its share price was up an astounding 5.16% during the short week.\nSo what is going on inside this fund that caused it to outperform the indices by so much last week?\nCracking it open\nLike all other healthcare focus ETFs, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF holds a diverse collection of companies in the sector. However, this ETF distinguishes itself in three distinct ways from other funds that helped it perform so well last week.\nFirst off, as its name implies this ETF only invests in biotech stocks, so unlike other healthcare ETFs the XBI doesn't hold any other healthcare related companies, such as health insurers. Thus, when biotech stocks perform well, so does the XBI. Second, this fund follows an equal-weight strategy, which means that it initially invests the same amount of its capital equally into each one of its 103 holdings. Finally, this ETF tends to focus on buying and holding mostly small cap biotech stocks, as the average company in this ETF has a market cap of roughly $2 billion, which is dwarfed but its category average market cap, which rings in closer to $35 billion.\nTaken together those three attributes tend to make the XBI much more volatile than a typical healthcare ETF, which can lead to wild swings in its share price. While that fact can make it no fun to hold on to this name when the markets are in a foul mood, when things are going well this fund can really do well, as it did last week.\nTop holdings\nBut what specifically happened this week that caused the fund to do so well? To help answer that question its best to look at the funds top holdings to see what caused the outperformance.\nCompany Symbol % Assets Five Prime Therapeutics FPRX 1.96 Dyax Corp DYAX 1.60 Kite Pharma KITE 1.46 Juno Therapeutics JUNO 1.45 MacroGenics Inc MGNX 1.41 Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc ACHN 1.39 Spark Therapeutics ONCE\n1.39 Ophthotech Corp. OPHT 1.36 Geron Corporation GERN 1.36 Prothena Corporation PLC PRTA 1.29\nWhat went right this week\nMany of these stocks performed very well over the past week, which is certainly a big reason why this ETF was up so much over such a short time period. Five Prime Therapeutics proved to be the top performer of the group last week as its shares were up nearly 9% for the week. Several other of the funds top holdings showed great returns as well, as Geron posted a 8.47% gain during the week and Prothena (NASDAQ:PRTA) showed a gain of more than 6%.\nWhile not a single one of these companies released any news during the week to justify the huge move, all three of those company's stocks have been on fire recently -- each of them is up more than 28% in the last month alone.\nProthena shares in particular continue to perform exceptionally well, and this recent run-up is capping off a banner year. Shares of this small cap are up more then 220% over the last 12 months as investors have been bidding up the stock ever since they got their first look at results of its experimental Parkinson's disease drug PRX-002. This drug is designed to reduce the build up of a neural protein in the brain called alpha-synuclein that is associated with the disease.\nEarlier this year the company reported that patients who took PRX-002 saw their alpha synuclein levels drop by as much as 96%, which is a massive improvement that performed significantly better than a placebo. Given that Parkinson's is a huge market that is particularly difficult to treat it's no wonder that investors are excited about the potential of PRX-002, and they continue to bid up shares.\nCan XBI continue to win?\nThe SPDR S&P Biotech ETF has been a terrific investment for several years in a row now. I personally like this funds equal weight strategy, as I think that its quite smart to place a lot of small bets in the small cap biotech space and let the winners grow. The fact that is also sports a dirt cheap expense ratio of 0.35% makes it also an inexpensive and lower risk way to get in. If you are interested in the small cap biotech space but do not want to have to pick individual stocks for yourself, I think this ETF is a terrific way to go.\n}}

{{LONDON, Jan 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Transgender people in Britain called for more equal access to public healthcare on Thursday, saying they faced long waits for help in transitioning, after a senior politician said the government had \u201cmishandled\u201d trans issues.\nSome reported waiting up to two years for an appointment at a specialist gender identity clinic, while others said they were refused altogether.\nAimee Challenor came out as transgender at 16 and was referred to a clinic that treats children, but said she had to wait almost two years to be transferred to a clinic for transgender adults when she turned 18.\n\u201cYou get increasingly panicked over, \u2018Is this care going to be in place, it is going to continue?\u2019\u201d Challenor told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday.\nNow 21, she said she subsequently self-medicated using the hormone oestrogen and a testosterone suppressive for nine months in 2017.\nUnder current law, trans people need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proof of having lived in their new gender for at least two years to legally change their gender.\nThe comments came after Maria Miller, who chairs the women and equalities committee in the British parliament\u2019s lower house, accused the government of prioritising political issues over practical ones like access to public services.\n\u201cI think they have mishandled their approach to trans issues,\u201d she told the Press Association media agency on Wednesday.\n\u201cMany trans people simply don\u2019t have access to the basic healthcare that the rest of us take for granted,\u201d she added, saying some transgender men had been unable to get cervical smear tests.\nTwo in five trans people said they had encountered healthcare staff who did not understand their needs, according to a 2018 survey by British LGBT+ charity Stonewall.\nChallenor said she was concerned she might experience what she called \u201ctrans broken arm syndrome\u201d if she had to see a different doctor to her usual one for issues not related to her gender transition.\n\u201cYou go in with a broken arm and they go, \u2018But what about your hormones?\u2019\u201d she said.\nTeacher Debbie Hayton said she had received psychiatric support within 18 weeks of asking for help in 2012. But she was not referred for gender surgery for two years and it was another two years before she actually got the surgery.\n\u201cThe unprecedented rise in demand was not being addressed at all,\u201d she said.\nReferrals to clinics that specialise in treating transgender adults have increased 240 percent in five years, James Palmer, the medical director for specialised services at NHS England, said at a conference in June 2018.\nParents of transgender children have reported \u201cmixed\u201d experiences with local doctors, said Susie Green, chief executive of trans youth charity Mermaids, which conducted a survey of 76 parents and young people.\nSome parents had doctors refuse to refer their children to specialist clinics. However, one parent reported receiving \u201cexcellent support\u201d, Green said.\n}}

{{When I was 14 years old, I was lured away from home by a man I met at a New Jersey shopping mall. This man told me that I was pretty enough to be a model and that I was too mature for high school. It was the summer after my eighth grade middle school graduation, and I feared high school. I was afraid of getting beat up in the hallways, and I was afraid of losing my friends. This man pretended to be my friend, a romantic interest even. He said he could help me find a glamorous job in Los Angeles, California. Within hours of running away, however, this man forced and coerced me into prostitution in Atlantic City, NJ.\nIt didn't take long for law enforcement to spot me - I was a young girl on Pacific Avenue wearing a red dress and oversized high heel shoes. Unfortunately, I wasn't immediately seen as a victim of a crime. I was seen as a criminal, a juvenile delinquent, and I was arrested for prostitution. The most painful part of this experience wasn't what happened to me in Atlantic City, it was the way I was treated after Atlantic City - by law enforcement and even hospital staff. Today, I'm passionate about sharing my story and working with front-line professionals. By understanding my mindset and needs as a young victim of sex trafficking, professionals will be better equipped to recognize and respond to this victim population.\nRecently, I joined Dignity Health as Patient Care Services Program Director, overseeing a program to identify and effectively respond to victims of human trafficking in the healthcare setting. As one of the largest healthcare systems in the nation, and the largest hospital provider in California, Dignity Health is positioned to affect the lives of many, including patients who are vulnerable to human trafficking. A 2014 study found that nearly 88% of sex trafficking survivors reported having contact with the healthcare system while being exploited. The study reveals how medical providers are \"woefully unprepared\" to identify and respond to victims. At Dignity Health, we aim to change that, and we started with education, implementation of internal protocols, and identification of community resources that can assist trafficked persons.\nIn order to be successful, any program of this design must ensure staff are educated on what human trafficking is and isn't. There are many myths and misconceptions associated with this crime. Unless all staff are well informed, victims can and will be missed in the healthcare setting. At Dignity Health, with support from the Dignity Health Foundation, we created a series of educational modules, the first of which dispels 10 myths often associated with human trafficking. Following are a few summarized examples:\nMyth: Human trafficking only happens overseas.\nTruth: Every country is affected by human trafficking, including the United States. The United States passed federal legislation to outlaw two common forms of human trafficking: sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Human trafficking is defined as forcing or coercing a person to perform commercial sex or labor\/services. Labor trafficking includes situations of debt bondage, forced labor, and involuntary child labor. A commercial sex act is defined as any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person (e.g. money, drugs, survival needs). Under federal law, anyone under age 18 who is induced to perform commercial sex is a victim of human trafficking - no force or coercion is required.\nMyth: Only foreign nationals are trafficked in the United States.\nTruth: U.S. citizens are also at risk of human trafficking victimization within the United States. In 2015, there were over 5,500 cases reported, and least 1,660 of these cases involved victims who were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\nMyth: Human trafficking and human smuggling are the same crime.\nTruth: Human trafficking is NOT the same crime as human smuggling. Human trafficking is a violation of someone's human rights. Human smuggling is a violation of a country's immigration laws. A person can consent to being smuggled into the country; however, if that person is forced or coerced into commercial sex or labor, then he\/she may be a victim of human trafficking.\nMyth: Everyone involved in prostitution is doing so by choice.\nTruth: Oftentimes adults are choosing to perform commercial sex work (e.g. prostitution, stripping, pornography) due to a lack of options as opposed to an actual choice. We must refrain from passing judgement onto commercial sex workers and we must offer compassion and resources to any patient in need of help. Many survivors of sex trafficking reported feeling so isolated and stigmatized by society that they felt unable to reach out for help.\nMyth: Victims of human trafficking will reach out for help.\nTruth: Oftentimes victims of sex trafficking, especially youth, do not self-identify as victims. Due to prior abuse, victims may not realize they are being manipulated or exploited. Sex traffickers often target abused\/vulnerable youth. Victims of sex or labor trafficking may blame themselves, may fear authorities, or may fear retaliation by traffickers. Foreign national victims may not speak English and may not know their rights in America.\nMyth: All traffickers are stereotypical \"pimps\".\nTruth: When we hear the term pimp, we often think of the stereotypical pimp with the flashy hat and clothes. Although these pimps exist, they are no longer the norm. Anyone can be a trafficker, including family members, friends, and neighbors. One mother sold her 7- and 14-year-old daughters for sex at truck stops in Nebraska. \"Pimping\" has become so normalized and even glamorized in the media that many young men and boys, especially gang members, want to become pimps. Gangs consider it easier to sell a person for sex than to sell drugs or guns. Drugs and guns can be sold only once. A person, however, can be sold for sex over and over again.\nMyth: Human trafficking refers only to sex trafficking.\nTruth: Labor trafficking often does not get as much attention in the media as sex trafficking; however, labor trafficking in the United States is real. Labor trafficking has been identified in industries like agriculture, hospitality, domestic work (e.g. live-in maid), and traveling sales crews. Victims may be charged a fee that's impossible to pay off (i.e. debt bondage). Victims may be forced to work 12+ hours per day, 7 days per week. Victims may not be allowed to leave the work premises and may be forced to sleep on the floor or in a makeshift bed in the back of the business. Victims of domestic servitude may be forced to sleep in the home. Victims working in traveling sales crews may be forced to sleep in a van.\nAt Dignity Health, our core mission is to deliver compassionate, high quality, and affordable health services, to serve and advocate for those who are poor and disenfranchised, and to partner with others in the community to improve the quality of life. In order to bolster this mission and generate compassion for victims, we include survivor stories in our education whenever possible. A survivor can help professionals see the humanity in those who are too often stigmatized by society (e.g. commercial sex workers, undocumented immigrants, homeless and runaway youth).\nBasic education for healthcare staff should include red flags in the healthcare setting and the role(s) of front-line staff in established protocols. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) hotline should also be included as a 24-hour resource to report suspicious activity, inquire about local resources, and seek support for a victim. The hotline number is 1-888-373-7888. If your healthcare facility implements a similar program, please continue to engage staff with ongoing education, survivor speakers, and awareness efforts in the facility.\n}}

{{Perth Prison has been hit by a population crisis, placing a serious strain on lifeline services and extra pressure on staff.\nIn the last few days, the number of inmates at the 630-capacity jail has soared to 710, forcing more prisoners to share cells.\nBosses believe the sudden increase could mark a sea change for the institution and numbers could grow even further. A total cap has now been set at 730, despite concern that some service providers will struggle to cope with the extra workload.\nThe increase has hit the healthcare team working to make improvements following a highly critical inspection report in October.\nThe Perth and Kinross Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed that the population surge over the last 10 days had become its biggest challenge.\nHead of Health Evelyn Devine explained that a robust improvement plan had been drawn up by staff after HM Inspectorate of Prisons graded the performance in Perth as \u201cpoor\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cThe healthcare workforce is designed for 630 prisoners, and we\u2019ve been pushing the boundaries to 650 prisoners. Last week, the prison had 710 prisoners.\n>>24 Days of Christmas \u2013 Click here for special festive deals from some of our favourite local businesses\n\u201cWe have to put in contingency planning around that. We are worried that all the good improvements that have been made could be lost very quickly.\u201d\nAddressing councillors and NHS Tayside officials at a meeting in Perth, Ms Devine said: \u201cWe are continuing to work on improvements and look at ways of being able to deliver as best we can, with this additional caseload.\u201d\nShe said there had been a marked increase in the inmate population across Scotland. \u201cWe have seen other prisons where they have had to put extra mattresses into cells,\u201d she said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been done in Perth yet, but I don\u2019t think that this problem is going to go away and we genuinely have to plan for it.\u201d\nThe committee heard governor Fraser Munro was supporting the healthcare team, by take steps to ensure nurses would not be called unnecessarily.\nJames Foulis, NHS Associate Nurse Director said: \u201cWe are in the midst of a significant challenge.\n\u201cWith the numbers of prisoners increasing, we have had to increase the level of agency staff.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cWe had hoped that, because of the pressures we are under, that Perth Prison could be capped at a lower number (than 730), but that has not been possible.\u201d\nChief financial officer Jane Smith said population increase will lead to \u201csignificant\u201d extra costs. \u201cGetting a grip on the recurring implications is really important,\u201d she said.\nPerth SNP councillor Eric Drysdale said: \u201cFurther overcrowding at Perth Prison is only going to increase the likelihood of mental health issues.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf this increase in the prison population is to be semi-permanent then its not right that this organisation has no option but to just absorb these increases in costs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable and we need to be making representations in the strongest terms to the Scottish Government, because this needs to change.\u201d\nA Scottish Prison Service spokesman confirmed that the country\u2019s prison population had jumped from around 7,500 in March to 8,000 \u2013 about the size of HMP Shotts.\nHe said there was not just one factor behind the rise, although it is largely down to longer sentences and more convictions for sexual offences.\n}}

{{(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (APO.N) will buy LifePoint Health LPNT.O in a $5.6 billion (4.27 billion pounds) deal that will expand its rural U.S. hospitals business, the latest in a series of bets by private equity firms on healthcare.\nThe deal comes as Tennessee-based LifePoint and many of its peers face higher medical costs, fewer patient admissions and changes to reimbursement policies in Medicare and Medicaid that have pressured profits.\nTo compensate, LifePoint has been beefing up its presence in rural regions including in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and streamlining operations at healthcare facilities there.\nThe deal will bring together LifePoint and Apollo\u2019s RCCH HealthCare Partners, LifePoint said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report on Friday that the parties were in advanced talks for a buyout.\nApollo\u2019s deal - its biggest this year - is the latest in a recent surge of public investments by U.S. private equity, the highest since the 2007-08 global financial crisis.\nWith a record $1 trillion in cash at their disposal, top private equity names have turned to healthcare. Just last month, KKR (KKR.N) and Veritas Capital each snapped up publicly-listed healthcare firms in multi-billion dollar deals.\nIndeed, hospital operators are alluring to investors, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph France said. Because their operations are largely U.S.-based, hospital firms benefit more from lower tax rates than the average U.S. company, and are also more insulated from global trade uncertainties, France said.\nApollo\u2019s transaction value includes $2.9 billion of LifePoint\u2019s net debt and minority interest. The combined company will be led by current LifePoint Chief Executive Officer William Carpenter III.\nLifePoint shares \u2014 down some 27 percent in the past year \u2014 jumped nearly 34 percent to $64 in premarket trading, $1 shy of Apollo\u2019s all-cash offer price.\nBarclays, Citigroup, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse will finance Apollo\u2019s acquisition. PSP Investments Credit USA LLC and an affiliate of Qatar Investment Authority will also provide part of the debt financing.\nLifePoint will accept competing bids until Aug. 22, it said.\n}}

{{Aetna and CVS Health recently merged in a $69 billion deal causing many to question what the new duo\u2019s role will be in the reshaping and the future of healthcare. D\u2019Amore-McKim School of Business professors Timothy Hoff, Patricia Illingworth and Gary Young commented on the benefits and setbacks of this change in a recent News@Northeastern article.\nYoung believes one benefit of the merger could be better access to healthcare. With a CVS on virtually every corner and Aetna\u2019s network of physicians, patients may be more likely to find a place for care with ease and continue to go back for checkups. A drawback of this could include Aetna restricting healthcare choices for patients.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an effort to channel people into using CVS services as opposed to their competitors,\u201d Young said. He also added that patients seeking care out-of-network could be penalized.\nOn the other hand, Hoff wonders what the level of care would be like at CVS.\n\u201cThe services in retail health settings are built for funneling lots of low-level care transactions through the system, meaning less emphasis on the complex relational care most patients need,\u201d said Hoff. \u201cWhat can happen is that choice goes down, prices go up, and bottom lines get enhanced, but the patient experience does not. It also leads to what I call a cheapened form of care delivery.\u201d\nHoff\u2019s recently published book Next in Line: Lowered Care Expectations in the Age of Retail- and Value-Based Health, explores this issue and others related to patient care.\nPatricia Illingworth highlights the conflict of interest between Aetna and CVS. If a physician\u2019s purpose is to serve the patient, not sell to him or her, this new merger could get tricky.\n\u201cThe main mission of CVS is to sell medicine. It\u2019s not to take care of patients,\u201d Illingworth said. \u201cWhen someone is seeking medical care, they shouldn\u2019t be preyed upon in that way.\u201d\nFull story.\n}}

{{CHICAGO (Reuters) - Thomas DeRosa is making a $4 billion bet that he can build a national, low-cost healthcare network for America\u2019s aging population that will succeed where so many other models have struggled.\nThe main entrance of the HCR ManorCare headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, U.S., May 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Aaron Josefczeyk\nHis secret: strip out the \u201cfor-profit\u201d business model, and leverage the real estate in nursing homes for outpatient care.\nDeRosa\u2019s strategy starts with buying out the property of the huge bankrupt nursing home chain HCR ManorCare, and teaming up with a non-profit hospital operator, ProMedica, to create a 30-state healthcare system.\nHis own company, real estate investment trust Welltower Inc (WELL.N), is purchasing the ManorCare real estate for $2.7 billion under a deal unveiled April 24 and awaiting approval from a U.S. bankruptcy court.\nProMedica is buying ManorCare\u2019s operations for $1.3 billion and combining them with its own surgery centers, clinics and health plan to form a network with $7 billion of annual revenues and 70,000 employees.\n\u201cThis is about a health system moving into a beleaguered sector of healthcare,\u201d DeRosa told Reuters in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking down the wall of what has traditionally been acute care services and services for the aging.\u201d\nThe aim is to strip out $300 million in costs from the operation, mainly from cheaper rent, once HCR ManorCare emerges from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year, according to interviews with Welltower and ProMedica executives.\nProMedica Chief Executive Randy Oostra expects the merger - which will propel the group into the 25 largest U.S. health systems by revenue alongside names like Mayo Clinic, Geisinger and Johns Hopkins - to boost margins by two percentage points to between 3 percent and 4 percent over the next few years.\nProMedica will also invest $400 million to revamp ManorCare\u2019s facilities, and size up every site as an opportunity for different services or partnerships.\nAnd by turning non-profit under ProMedica\u2019s existing business model, ManorCare will see other annual cost savings of $30 million.\n\u201cIt is a disruptor,\u201d Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, said of the deal.\nYet the merged group must still overcome a perfect storm of eroding reimbursement rates, depressed occupancies, and competition from home health that has weighed on nursing facilities nation-wide.\nTo view a graphic on Real estate investments in senior housing, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2I8SOR5\nA NEW APPROACH\nThe proposal comes at a time when companies from hospitals and pharmacy chains including Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) and CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) to insurance providers and retailers like Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) are jostling to create new healthcare models for an aging population as U.S. medical costs continue to soar.\nOutside the health sector, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has joined forces with Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) for a new model to help bring down healthcare costs.\nREITs, including Welltower, invested heavily in skilled nursing centers at the turn of the decade but have struggled to collect, let alone raise, rents. Large REITs like Ventas Inc (VTR.N) have since abandoned the sector.\nFor hospitals, declining payments by Medicare - the largest payer for the 65 and over population - and declining admissions are driving a search for lower cost, non-hospital settings to deliver care, Oostra said.\nMedicare penalties for patient readmissions are also forcing hospitals to follow up on recoveries, which often occur at a skilled nursing facility.\n\u201cIncreasingly we\u2019re getting more focused on things that go on outside of our walls,\u201d Oostra told Reuters.

{{Hearing from those living and working in Virginia\u2019s Fifth District continues to be my greatest resource as I serve them. Their input has brought to light problems created by some of the big government programs coming out of Washington.\nRecently, a constituent contacted our office to express concern over the fact that he was unable to delete his profile from Healthcare.gov. Even though he ultimately decided not to sign up for healthcare coverage, he still could not remove his profile from the site. When he called the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he was told there was personal information that simply could not be removed.\nHe then asked our office to contact HHS and reiterate his request, but we were also told applicants could delete applications but could not remove all of their information from the system. We found that other people experienced the same problem, so we continued to press HHS for answers but received no justification for this policy. It became clear that legislative action would be necessary to ensure that Americans can protect their personal information.\nRepealing the President\u2019s healthcare law and replacing it with healthcare reform based upon market-oriented principles remains one of my top priorities, but with such sensitive information at risk, this problem must be resolved as soon as possible.\nI recently introduced the Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act, H.R. 5610, along with my democratic colleague, Congressman John Barrow of Georgia, which will enable individuals to remove their profiles from the federal healthcare website, HealthCare.gov.\nThis issue is particularly critical given all the reports over the past year regarding the security vulnerabilities of HealthCare.gov. In July, HealthCare.gov was hacked, and the malicious software embedded in the site was not even discovered for weeks. Two weeks ago, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study pointing out that several privacy and security risks from the site\u2019s launch, almost a full year ago, had not yet been fixed. The gao reported that there are still serious risks of unauthorized access, disclosure, and modification to all information collected and maintained by this website.\nThis administration has been so focused on getting Healthcare.gov to function at a basic level that it did not take sufficient action to ensure that users\u2019 personal information will be protected. Given the outrageous amount of money the administration has spent building the website \u2013 more than $2 billion according to the most recent report \u2013 it is astonishing that these digital vulnerabilities persist, jeopardizing the personal information of millions of Americans.\nThese grave security concerns make it even more imperative that individuals have the ability to remove their personal information permanently from Healthcare.gov, which this bill enables. The bipartisan Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act is a direct response to these concerns about privacy and the protection of personal information for those using Healthcare.gov, and it is a compliment to the robust oversight we in the House are conducting to press the administration to protect this data.\nWhile I still believe we need repeal the President\u2019s healthcare law and replace it with real healthcare reform based upon market-oriented principles, the Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act is a critical step forward. It is my hope this bill moves swiftly through the legislative process. I look forward to working with Representative Barrow and my colleagues to ensure that individual privacy is protected.\nIf you need any additional information, please visit my website at hurt.house.gov or call my Washington office: (202) 225-4711, Charlottesville office: (434) 973-9631, Danville office: (434) 791-2596, or Farmville office: (434) 395-0120.\nRobert Hurt represents the Fifth District in Congress.\nLike this: Like Loading...\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n}}

{{A man carries a child as he walks past the entrance to the Countess of Chester Hospital, Chester, Britain, July 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Andrew Yates\nLONDON (Reuters) - A British female healthcare worker has been arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies and trying to murder six others after an investigation into deaths at a neonatal unit in northern England, police said on Tuesday.\nThe arrest came after an inquiry into the deaths of 17 babies and 15 \u201cnon-fatal collapses\u201d between March 2015 and July 2016 at The Countess of Chester Hospital\u2019s neonatal unit.\n\u201cThis is a highly complex and very sensitive investigation and, as you can appreciate, we need to ensure we do everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses,\u201d said Detective Inspector Paul Hughes in a statement.\nPolice, who launched their investigation in May last year, would not give further details about the arrested woman, who was simply described as a healthcare professional. Hughes said the investigation was still \u201cvery much active\u201d.\n\u201cThis is an extremely difficult time for all the families and it is important to remember that, at the heart of this, there are a number of bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children,\u201d he added.\nThe hospital said it was supporting detectives with their investigation, adding it was confident that the baby unit was \u201csafe to continue in its current form\u201d.\n\u201cAsking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here ..,\u201d the hospital\u2019s Medical Director Ian Harvey said.\n}}

{{Congressman Robert Hurt (R-Virginia) released the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 33, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act, which would ensure that emergency service volunteers are not included when determining full-time employees to be considered under the employer mandate of the President\u2019s healthcare law:\n\u201cCommunities throughout Virginia\u2019s Fifth District rely on volunteer firefighters and emergency responders, and we are thankful every day for the sacrifices they make. The President\u2019s healthcare law imposes fines on businesses and entities not in compliance with the law\u2019s employer mandate; therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that our volunteer organizations are protected from these penalties.

{{A new fMRI study shows that when people are exposed to the idea of unequal healthcare funding, a region of the brain associated with social and moral disgust is strongly activated.\nThe study, which is the first to use fMRI scans to observe what happens in the brain when people are asked to make difficult choices on healthcare spending, found that the anterior insula was activated when people felt an unfair choice had been proposed.\nThe anterior insula is involved in processing human disgust \u2014 such as the experience of foul smells or unpleasant images \u2014 but is also triggered when we feel a strong sense of moral outrage \u2014 for example, at the perceived breach of social or ethical norms.\nThe research was conducted by neuroscientists, psychologists, and economists from the University of Lincoln, the Open University, University of Oxford, and the Exeter Magnetic Resonance Research Centre in the UK, and Flinders University in Australia.\nFor the study, the researchers asked a series of hypothetical questions to 30 participants on whether different scenarios for dividing funds between a variety of social groups were \u2018fair\u2019 or \u2018unfair\u2019. This included questions about spending on healthcare, superfast broadband, and housing benefit. The social groups were defined by criteria including age, marital status, and income.\nThe brain scan findings showed that brain processes involved in making decisions of fairness were significantly different for medical compared to non-medical scenarios. Subjects were far more likely to perceive uneven distributions of healthcare funding as unfair.\nFurthermore, when subjects did approve of unequal distributions of resources in any setting, they appeared to suppress their \u2018disgust\u2019 response in order to make rational, utilitarian choices.\nFor example, the scans revealed activation of the inferior frontal cortex \u2014 an area of the brain associated with response inhibition \u2014 when subjects were pre-briefed on the principle that resources might need to be distributed unequally to maximize the benefit. This suppression was much less prevalent in the medical scenarios.\n\u201cImportant healthcare decisions like funding allocations are often measured by a system called Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), which prioritizes choices that deliver the maximum benefit to the greatest number of people,\u201d said co-author Professor Timothy Hodgson, head of the University of Lincoln\u2019s School of Psychology.\n\u201cThe problem is those decisions are often viewed negatively by members of the general public, who instead believe that everybody has a right to receive medical care and anything that violates this principle is unfair and immoral.\u201d\n\u201cGiven enough information people may be more inclined to support healthcare decisions based on QALYs, but this requires cognitive effort to override a more emotion-based bias towards absolute equality and universal rights.\u201d\nThe results are consistent with previous research showing that decision-making involves complex interactions between two distinct systems of the brain: one rational and one emotional.\nThe new findings represent a preliminary first step for cognitive neuroscience into the field of health economics \u2014 an area of major socioeconomic importance.\nThe findings are reported in the Journal of Neuroscience Psychology and Economics.\nSource: University of Lincoln\nBrain Scan Shows \u2018Moral Disgust\u2019 in Response to Unequal Healthcare Funding\n}}

{{Gender disparities in healthcare New studies show the U.S. ranks last in preventable deaths, and a surprising majority are women.\nNew rankings about how countries deal with preventable deaths got me thinking about those elusive ills that deeply influence women's lives yet may never get attention. The study, published in the journal Health Affairs, found that out of 19 industrialized nations, France topped the list in avoiding preventable deaths and the United States was dead last. The research claims that if the U.S. performed as well as France, there would be 101,000 fewer preventable deaths each year.\nWith women constituting 51 percent of the population giving birth to all of it, it's not hard to see how healthcare policies might affect us more. It's also interesting to note that, as defined by the researchers, preventable deaths strike women more often than men. According to their definition -- which included deaths under age 75 from certain surgical procedures, bacterial infections, diabetes, certain cancers and heart disease -- preventable deaths account for 32 percent of deaths for women and only 23 percent of deaths for men.\nAdvertisement:\nSince men typically die younger than women, one has to wonder what was left out of this definition. For instance, the researchers did not specifically mention pregnancy-related deaths (which obviously apply only to women) or causes of death from war or violence (which are more likely to kill men).\nBut with so many studies pointing to a measurable healthcare gap between men and women, it doesn't take a giant leap of paranoia to conclude that more women die of preventable deaths than men because fewer women are getting the healthcare they need. The researchers did note that the biggest difference between the United States and those countries at the top of the preventable-death rankings has mostly to do with access. Although American medicine may be a global model of cutting-edge expertise, American healthcare pretty much sucks for the 47 million people without insurance. Yet the most recent numbers I could find (from a 2002 New York Times article) suggest that though the number of uninsured women is rising more rapidly than that of uninsured men, there are still more men without insurance.\nHow such numbers end up in leading to more preventable deaths among women, I don't know. But I couldn't help noticing the parallels between this study and the recent rankings on gender parity; in the area of \"health and survival\" the U.S. was ranked a pathetic 36 out of 128 countries, and France was ranked No. 1.\n}}

{{By AFP\nUS President Barack Obama will on Thursday make an \"opening argument\" on a perennial crusade that has thwarted previous presidents - making affordable healthcare available to all Americans.\nObama, who made healthcare reform a centerpiece of his election campaign last year, will hold a televised White House \"summit\" as the first step in a politically perilous plan. The event at the White House, with 120 lawmakers, officials and healthcare experts comes a week after Obama asked Congress in his budget for 634 billion dollars to fund healthcare reform over the next 10 years. \"This is the first, sort of the opening argument,\" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Wednesday. \"This is a first step in starting a process that the president believes is long overdue.\"\nThe forum will be screened on the C-Span public affairs network and is expected to be streamed live on the Internet, as Obama opens the meeting with remarks before participants break out into several discussion forums. The format is similar to a fiscal responsibility \"summit\" Obama held last week, in line with his stated attempt to reach across political divides to trim the gaping US budget deficit.\nObama opened his drive for healthcare reform on Monday by nominating Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius as his new health secretary, to replace former senator Tom Daschle who withdrew over a storm over unpaid taxes. The president argued that relieving families and businesses of the soaring costs of healthcare payments was not just a moral imperative but was key to solving the crisis. \"We cannot fail to act yet again,\" Obama said, vowing to make good on a campaign promise to offer \"quality, affordable healthcare\" to every American. \"Fixing what's wrong with our health care system is no longer just a moral imperative, but a fiscal imperative. \"The crushing cost of healthcare causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds, and by the end of this year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes.\" The details of Obama's proposals are not yet clear, and efforts to frame legislation have already been launched by Democrats in Congress.\nRepublicans are expected to try to derail the president's healthcare plan and force a victory that would severely diminish his political clout. Critics of healthcare reform often deride plans to expand coverage as \"European-style socialized medicine.\" Former president Bill Clinton's failed healthcare reform drive, under the direction of his wife Hillary Clinton, still sends shudders down the spines of leading Democrats.\nThe United States has one of the world's most advanced, but confusing healthcare systems, a patchwork of private and state coverage, distinct from the single payer national health systems of Canada and Britain for example. More than half of Americans are covered by health insurance provided by their employers, but such insurance is not a requirement and nearly 46 million Americans have no coverage at all. The federal government in 2006 covered about a third of US healthcare spending, mainly through its health insurance programs for the poor and elderly - Medicaid and Medicare. Payments by private insurances companies accounted for another 34 per cent, while out-of-pocket payments by individuals amounted to 14 per cent of the total. The remainder came from state and local funds and other private funds.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? Does the US healthcare system need change?

{{Summary Four years ago, after 14-year-old Hassina Soulyman spent two days in labor at home, weak from loss of blood and falling in and out of consciousness, her family knew something was terribly wrong. They set her on a motorcycle\u2014the only transport in her village\u2014with two men holding her between them for a two-hour ride to a larger village. There they waited hours for a car to take her to one of only two hospitals in the rebel-held areas of Sudan\u2019s Southern Kordofan state. When they finally got her there, a doctor delivered her stillborn baby by cesarean section and told Hassina that her cervix was too narrow to give birth vaginally. Without adequate health information or access to contraception, Hassina became pregnant two more times. Her second baby was delivered at the hospital but died before reaching six months. During the last weeks of her third pregnancy, when she was 18, Hassina and her family fled her village to escape aerial bombing by the Sudanese government. She went into labor in the riverbed where her family was sheltering and endured three days of obstructed labor, during which the body of the baby cleared the birth canal but the separated head was stuck in her womb before she could get transport to a hospital for medical assistance. She survived another operation, but as of December 2016, when Human Rights Watch met her, Hassina still did not have access to family planning assistance. Sudan: Obstruction of Aid Denies Women Lifesaving Health Care Most women and girls in the rebel-held Nuba Mountains of Sudan lack access to reproductive health care, including emergency obstetric care. Their plight is one of the little known yet far-reaching effects of years of obstruction of aid to the area by the Sudanese government and armed opposition. *** Women and girls living in rebel-held areas of the Nuba mountains of Southern Kordofan, Sudan have little or no access to contraception, adequate antenatal care, or emergency obstetric care\u2014leaving them unable to control the number and spacing of their children, and exposing them to serious health complications and sometimes death. Reduced access to health services is one of the many devastating consequences of six years of armed conflict between Sudanese government forces and the armed wing of the rebel Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement\/Army-North (SPLM\/A-North), a spin-off of the former southern Sudanese liberation movement and now ruling party of independent South Sudan. Healthcare access was low in the four areas currently under the control of rebels\u2013 and worse than in other parts of Sudan because of marginalization by Sudan\u2019s government and earlier conflicts\u2014 even before the current war began in 2011. The poor humanitarian situation there cannot be entirely blamed on the conflict. However, unlawful government bombardment, destruction of clinics including by bombing, poor distribution of medicines, and hard-to-cross frontlines have all further reduced access. Launch Map Expand Share A United Nations-led humanitarian aid effort to improve the humanitarian situation has not been put in place. Both parties to the conflict have failed to agree on a joint modality for a sustained humanitarian effort, despite 15 rounds of African Union-moderated talks over six years, and many proposals and other efforts by UN officials and diplomats. Hundreds of thousands of people live in the rebel-controlled areas without the health services, food aid, and other basic assistance that a full UN-coordinated humanitarian response would attempt to provide. Humanitarian aid workers in the area are concerned that civilians in some areas may now be facing the worst food shortages since 2011 and 2012, when food shortages contributed to massive displacement and people reportedly died of hunger. In December 2016, two Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed 90 people in rebel-held areas of Heiban, Delami and Um Dorein counties, including 25 in-depth interviews with women and girls about their access to reproductive healthcare. Researchers also spoke with witnesses and victims of abuse, local rebel authorities, and humanitarian aid workers. This research builds on findings from five earlier Human Rights Watch investigations in the Nuba Mountains region, hilly areas of Sudan\u2019s Kordofan area where communities from different Nuba tribes live, between 2011 and 2015. While civilians living in Southern Kordofan, especially in the rebel-held areas, face a myriad of human rights abuses, this report focuses on limited access for women and girls to sexual and reproductive healthcare in the hope that highlighting this will draw the attention of the Sudanese government, SPLM\/A-North, and the international community to this particularly neglected aspect of humanitarian needs in the area. The report also describes how many years of negotiations and various efforts by diplomats, the African Union (AU) and the UN have all failed to provide humanitarians with unfettered access to communities in the rebel-held areas. When the conflict began in June 2011, Sudan\u2019s government banned international aid workers, including from UN agencies and international non-governmental organizations, from traveling to rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan. This travel ban remained in place as, year after year, the two parties failed to agree on arrangements for humanitarian access or implement agreements. Restrictive national regulations for humanitarian groups, closures of NGOs, and expulsions of staff from Khartoum, including senior UN staff, created a climate in which humanitarian groups chose not to push hard for access (in rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan). These restrictions meant that few international aid workers were allowed to work even in government-held areas of Southern Kordofan, and their activities were limited. Sudan\u2019s government has also consistently forbidden aid workers to cross international borders into rebel-held Sudan from neighboring South Sudan or Ethiopia. The SPLM\/A-North have\u2014 despite these restrictions\u2014encouraged and allowed aid workers to cross these borders into areas they control to deliver assistance. These programs, unauthorized by the Sudanese government, offer life-saving medical care and humanitarian assistance to civilians, but they only reach part of the population and their supplies are limited. Recently, the SPLM\/A-North have asked for further negotiations rather than accepting a late-2016 offer from the United States government to deliver medical assistance from government-controlled areas within Sudan. The rebels have continued to insist that they will only accept a proposal that allows for at least some cross-border aid, both so they can safely transport wounded fighters to medical assistance in neighboring countries, and because they have little trust that Khartoum will not interfere with any flow of assistance originating from within Sudan, as the government has in the past. Human Rights Watch found that civilians living in the rebel areas, many of whom have lived through two wars and faced terrible violations by government forces, also do not trust the Sudanese government not to interfere in delivery of aid. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Sudan\u2019s maternal mortality rate has fallen from 744 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 311 in 2015. However, women and girls in conflict-affected areas like rebel-held Southern Kordofan do not have access to the key government health services, supported by donor money, that have contributed to this decline. No recent data on maternal mortality is available for the region, but a joint research effort by the UN and the Sudanese government in 2006 put Southern Kordofan\u2019s maternal mortality rate at 503 per 100,000 live births, compared to 91 per 100,000 births in Northern state and 213 in Southern Kordofan\u2019s neighboring Northern Kordofan state. In rebel-held Nuba areas of Heiban, Delami and Um Dorein, antenatal care from skilled and equipped health workers is available at two hospitals and their outreach clinics, both operating without government authorization. However, many women and girls live too far away to access emergency care or live on the other side of frontlines of the conflict, making it too hazardous to travel to the facilities. Most pregnant women must rely on local birth attendants who have no formal training, or trained midwives who have not been able to acquire new or sterile equipment since the conflict began. Women and girls experiencing complications during labor may have to travel for days, often on dangerous routes, including across frontlines, to get emergency obstetric care. Family planning is not available except in rare instances. The rebel SPLM\/A-North administration provides the bulk of health care through a network of some 175 clinics, but these do not distribute contraception, including condoms. One agency provides three-month injectable contraception but restrictions imposed on them by the local rebels require patients\u2019 husbands to give permission before they can provide the contraception to women. Most of the women we interviewed did not know what a condom was and had not heard about other options for contraception. NGO workers, health workers and authorities told Human Rights Watch that condoms are rarely available in markets despite an increase in gonorrhea and syphilis cases over the past two years and high percentages of pregnant women testing positive for hepatitis B. Women and girls are unable to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections or control their fertility. In January 2017, the United States government, through a presidential order, lifted its economic sanctions on Sudan, citing the government\u2019s cooperation on counterterrorism, its role in addressing regional conflicts, reduced fighting in the conflict zones, and an easing of restrictions on humanitarian access. US policy makers are due to report on Sudan\u2019s continued performance in these respects in July 2017, and to decide whether to make the sanctions suspension permanent. Human Rights Watch has urged US policy makers to adopt a clear set of human rights benchmarks in this assessment. These should include respect for international humanitarian law, and in particular an end to indiscriminate bombing; demonstrable and tangible improvements to humanitarian access in conflict zones; releasing individuals arbitrarily detained without charge by the National Intelligence and Security Services; ending use of lethal force to suppress protests; and reforms to key legislation. Human Rights Watch urges the US to postpone its evaluation of Sudan\u2019s progress from July 2017 to a later date, as meaningful progress will take longer than the six months prescribed in the executive order. Also, more time is needed to assess Sudan\u2019s commitment to making broader human rights improvements. Since the government declared a unilateral ceasefire in June 2016, large-scale fighting has not been reported in Southern Kordofan, but shelling has been reported in some of Sudan\u2019s conflict zones. In 2017, aerial bombardment, which has marked much of the conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile state and the Darfur region, appears to have been paused, or at least greatly reduced. This year Sudan has allowed humanitarian agencies to conduct an assessment and deliver some aid in a previously inaccessible part of government-held Darfur, and allowed more UN staff in the government-held areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. Humanitarian organizations have welcomed improvements but government travel restrictions remain, especially in conflict-affected areas like Southern Kordofan. Unimpeded humanitarian aid across all conflict areas is critical. Unless the Sudanese government, the SPLM\/A-North, and the international community act to ensure humanitarian aid reaches rebel-held areas, the ability of hundreds of thousands of civilians to secure food and access healthcare\u2014including comprehensive reproductive healthcare\u2014may continue to deteriorate. Even with limited available resources, all governments have obligations to provide access to essential medicines as defined by WHO, and to make reproductive and maternal healthcare available and accessible. Obstructing the delivery of desperately-needed healthcare by impartial humanitarian aid groups in rebel-held areas, as the Sudanese government has done in the past, is a violation of Sudan\u2019s obligations under international humanitarian law, a violation of the right to health, and discriminates against the Nuba people who are the population directly impacted. The SPLM\/A-North also has violated its obligations as a party to the conflict by arbitrarily refusing to accept international aid to be delivered impartially from within Sudan. The policies and actions of authorities on both sides\u2014 Sudan\u2019s government and the SPLM\/A-North \u2013 in preventing the delivery of life saving humanitarian assistance to communities in need, should be investigated by the UN's Independent Expert on Sudan and other special rapporteurs, including experts on the right to health and the rights of internally displaced persons, to determine whether they constitute prosecutable offenses of war crimes or crimes against humanity. In conducting such investigation, consideration should be given to the context in which the actions to obstruct humanitarian assistance have taken place, such as the Sudanese government\u2019s aerial bombardment of populated areas, in order to determine the potential scope of crimes that may have been committed. The UN Security Council should impose individual sanctions against commanders or leaders determined to be responsible for clear obstruction of aid or any serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, and it should extend the arms embargo that currently exists on Darfur to Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. It should authorize a panel of experts to continue to monitor the situation in both areas. Currently, the Security Council maintains a sanctions regime on Sudan, which only covers violations that occur in Darfur. Sudan should allow the UN and other international agencies to operate unobstructed in conflict areas, including Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The SPLM\/A-North should agree to access by impartial aid providers, and not withhold agreement for delivery of humanitarian assistance arbitrarily. International law protects women\u2019s right to healthcare, including access to family planning services. Along with provision of food and other essential health services, humanitarian programming in rebel-held Southern Kordofan should include improving women\u2019s access to reproductive health services that allows them to exercise autonomy and control over their bodies and lives.\nRecommendations To the Government of Sudan Immediately stop all indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, including the use of unguided fragmentation bombs and cluster bombs.\nImmediately pledge to cease use of cluster munitions, in line with the international ban on cluster munitions.\nIn accordance with obligations under international law, urgently facilitate unimpeded access by UN agencies and national and international humanitarian aid groups to deliver impartial assistance, including sexual and reproductive healthcare, to civilians in need in all parts of Sudan, including areas under rebel control; expedite entry visas and travel authorization for humanitarian aid organizations and workers, and fully cooperate with such organizations.\nCancel arbitrary regulations on the operations of national and international nongovernmental organizations that place unnecessary obstacles and constraints on humanitarian assistance, and stop all bureaucratic and other obstruction of such operations.\nAgree on modalities for impartial humanitarian aid to be delivered into rebel-held parts of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, both cross-line and cross-border. Allow international monitoring of the aid delivery.\nInvestigate, charge and prosecute commanders responsible for unlawful attacks on civilians and civilian objects, including schools, hospitals and places of worship;\nInvite investigators from the African Union and the United Nations and their respective human rights bodies, and allow them to carry out impartial investigations into human rights abuses in Sudan, including in Southern Kordofan, by both parties to the conflict.\nRatify and implement the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Discrimination Against Women and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo protocol). To the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army-North In accordance with obligations under international law, urgently facilitate unimpeded access by UN agencies and national and international humanitarian aid groups to deliver impartial assistance, including sexual and reproductive healthcare, to civilians in need in all parts of areas under SPLA-North control; allow international monitoring, expedite travel authorization for all humanitarian aid organizations and workers, and fully cooperate with such organizations.\nWorking with international humanitarian partners, provide, in all clinics, comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare, including information about family planning and sexually transmitted infections, as well as contraception methods that protect against HIV\/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.\nCancel any local regulations, whether formal or informal, requiring women to obtain permission from their husbands to access contraception, make a public announcement of the change, and conduct information campaigns about family planning.\nConduct public awareness campaigns about family planning, female genital mutilation, child marriage, and maternal mortality.\nPromote and ensure participation of women in peace talks and in senior positions in the civilian administration of rebel-held areas.\nAdopt strategies to end child marriage and female genital mutilation and ensure perpetrators of domestic violence are punished within the law.\nPublicly commit to respect the Convention on the Elimination of All Discrimination Against Women and the Maputo protocol. To Humanitarian Organizations and Donors, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and Norway Advocate with parties of the conflict and the United Nations Security Council to ensure that civilians affected by conflict in Sudan, including those living in rebel-held areas, can access humanitarian aid services that meet international standards and press for access to these areas with both parties.\nConduct a full, independent humanitarian needs assessment once access to rebel-held Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile is possible, and address the urgent sexual and reproductive healthcare needs of women and girls.\nEnsure that all health services provided in the rebel-held areas adequately address the sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls. To the United Nations Security Council Demand that the parties to the conflict ensure safe and unhindered access for impartial humanitarian aid to rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, across both conflict lines and borders. Follow through with additional measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter, in the case of non-compliance, as outlined in Security Council resolution 2046.\nImpose targeted sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans against Sudanese government and SPLM\/A-North or SPLA-North officials deemed to be responsible for serious crimes, including indiscriminate bombing and other violations, and for willful obstruction of impartial humanitarian assistance to Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states in violation of international law;\nIn view of the significant evidence of serious violations of international humanitarian law against civilians by the Sudanese armed forces since 2011, expand the existing arms embargo on Darfur to apply to Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.\nAuthorize an independent inquiry into serious breaches of the laws of war by both sides in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. To the Independent Expert on Sudan Travel to rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states to monitor limitations on women's right to health. If access is not possible due to obstruction by the government of Sudan or the SPLM\/A-N, conduct interviews in refugee camps in South Sudan and Ethiopia to collect this information.\nInclude a review of women's health in next report. To the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the Enjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard of Physical and Mental Health Travel to rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states to monitor limitations on women's right to health. If access is not possible due to obstruction by the government of Sudan or the SPLM\/A-N, conduct interviews in refugee camps in South Sudan to collect this information. To the United States Government Monitor progress made by the Sudanese government against a concrete set of human rights benchmarks to evaluate its eligibility for continued sanctions relief. Key among these benchmarks is whether Sudan allows unimpeded access by humanitarian aid groups to all conflict affected areas, including rebel-held Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. Include access to maternal health care and family planning as a key indicator of access to humanitarian assistance;\nDelay formal evaluation of Sudan regarding the US sanctions to allow sufficient time for real progress to occur. The US should also re-evaluate the sanctions regime with an eye to imposing \u201csmart\u201d sanctions and designate new individuals against whom there is credible evidence, for targeted sanctions.\nMethodology This report is based on an 11-day fact-finding mission to Sudan and South Sudan in December 2016. Two Human Rights Watch researchers visited villages and displaced communities in Heiban, Delami, Buram and Um Dorein counties in Sudan\u2019s SPLM\/A-North controlled areas of Southern Kordofan, as well as the Yida refugee camp in Unity state, South Sudan. Through interviews with local communities, humanitarian aid workers, and authorities, as well as site visits, Human Rights Watch assessed the impact of Sudan\u2019s humanitarian blockade on the civilian population, and documented other human rights violations committed during the armed conflict, including the impact of the conflict on women\u2019s reproductive rights. Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 90 people in Southern Kordofan and South Sudan, including displaced people, refugees, victims, witnesses, local authorities, and humanitarian and health workers. We interviewed 25 women to understand obstacles to reproductive healthcare and the other human rights challenges confronting women. All but one of the women interviewed had children or had given birth, and most had done so recently. We interviewed 25 humanitarian aid workers and civil society members, including ten doctors and other health workers. Human Rights Watch also spoke to five people of authority in SPLM\/A-N. Interviews were conducted mainly in English or in Arabic (and in once case in the local Turo Nuba language), through translators. Human Rights Watch researchers conducted most interviews individually, but sometimes, because of the preference of the interviewee or with their permission, in groups. Interviews took place in towns, villages, settlements, and in the Yida refugee camp. We informed all interviewees of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which data would be collected and used. We have withheld the names and other identifying information of some of those interviewed, and in some cases replaced them with pseudonyms due to their preference for anonymity. Interviewees were also told that they could end the interview at any time, and choose to answer only the questions they wanted to. Human Rights Watch was unable to access many SPLM\/A-North controlled areas that are harder-to-reach or lie across frontlines. Access to healthcare is, by all accounts, far worse in these other areas. While civilians living in Southern Kordofan, especially in the rebel-held areas, face a myriad of human rights abuses, this report focuses on sexual and reproductive healthcare in the hope that highlighting this will draw attention of the Sudanese government and the international community to this particularly neglected aspect of the humanitarian needs in the area. Human Rights Watch was unable to verify allegations of human rights and international humanitarian law violations by the SPLM\/A-North in areas controlled by the Sudanese government, due to lack of access.\nI. Background The Protracted Conflict in Southern Kordofan Civilians in rebel-held Southern Kordofan, estimated to be one million people, have spent most of their lives in conflict. Much of Southern Kordofan is the \u201cNuba Mountains,\u201d areas characterized by rocky hills where dozens of Nuba tribes live. In 1985, Nuba fighters began supporting the mostly southern Sudanese rebel movement, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A), in its long war against the government of Sudan. The conflict was characterized by ethnic cleansing of the Nuba; abusive ground attacks; forced relocation from ancestral lands; widespread arrests, detentions and killings of Nuba individuals; and aerial bombardment. A 2002 ceasefire, followed by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the SPLM and the government of Sudan, brought civilians a temporary respite. On June 5, 2011, Sudanese government forces and Nuba SPLA forces clashed again in Southern Kordofan\u2019s capital, Kadugli. The fighting followed escalating tensions over security arrangements in the state and the narrow re-election of the governor, Ahmed Haroun, wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for serious crimes in Darfur. The Sudanese government resumed aerial bombardment on populated rebel-held areas within days. South Sudan officially seceded from Sudan in July 2011. The South\u2019s independence did not address the desire for meaningful political change in the Nuba Mountains and neighboring Blue Nile state. The SPLA forces based there renamed themselves SPLM\/A-North. Fighting between the SPLM\/A-North and Sudanese government forces spread to Blue Nile state in September 2011. During the first year of the renewed conflict, scores of SPLM\/A-North members and perceived sympathizers were arrested and detained. The \u201cnew\u201d war, now almost six years old, has had a devastating impact on civilians. Those living in rebel-held areas have been subjected to heavy bombing from planes and jets, and shelling, including on populated areas by the Sudanese government. These attacks killed at least 292 civilians and injured 749 between June 2011 and November 2016 in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. Civilians repeatedly described to Human Rights Watch researchers the intense terror and distress they experienced as a result of the bombardment. In December 2016, Diana Angelo, an aunt to six children killed in a bombing incident on May 1, 2016, described what she witnessed that day after the children, on hearing the sound of the planes, jumped into one of the large foxholes or ditches dotted all over villages and towns for people to crouch in during bombings: One of the bombs fell straight into the foxhole and threw the boys outside and cut them to pieces. We found one of their heads past the fence, and the others were burned beyond recognition. There were pieces of brain, lungs and intestine everywhere. When I got there, the wife of Abdurahman (the mother of the children) kept on shouting: \u2018Where are the children? Where are the children?\u2019 She was injured too by the debris and had to be taken to the hospital. Abdurahman wanted to kill himself after the attack. Nearly 250,000 people have fled both states to refugee camps in South Sudan between June 2011 and November 2016, including about 100,000 from Nuba.While some information about deaths, injuries and displacement is available, there is little detailed information about the effects on education, health, and livelihoods for those who have remained. The African Union High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), a body created to deal with African Union (AU) recommendations on Darfur, as well as implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the South\u2019s secession approached, initiated negotiations between the government of Sudan and the SPLM\/A-North a few weeks after the start of the conflict. The AUHIP drafted a framework agreement for political partnership and security arrangements, signed by both sides in August 2011, but later rejected by President Omar Hassan al Bashir. In November 2011, the SPLM\/A-North joined two other Sudanese rebel groups and agreed to a unified political and military approach to regime change under the Sudan Revolutionary Front umbrella. This complicated the peace negotiations considerably, as did poor relations between Sudan and South Sudan, especially during and immediately following a short 2012 border war at the Heglig oil fields, and the civil war in South Sudan that began in December 2013. Fifteen sets of talks between the government and the SPLM\/A-North in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, have failed to produce a permanent, joint cessation of hostilities (both sides have issued temporary unilateral ceasefires), unfettered access for humanitarian agencies, or a hint of lasting peace. UN Security Council resolution 2046 of May 2012, following the border violence, stated that both parties in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile should allow unhindered humanitarian access or face punitive measures; but both sides have ignored the resolution and the Security Council has not taken any further action. Diplomats from the US, the European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway, as well as AU officials, have supported the peace process and urged both sides to end fighting and allow for unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance. The government signed the AUHIP\u2019s \u2018roadmap for peace\u2019 on March 16, 2016, promising to urgently resume negotiation on humanitarian access, and a cessation of hostilities, followed by a permanent ceasefire; however, the SPLM\/A-North refused to sign until August. Within days of their unilateral signing of the roadmap, the government launched several large-scale land offensives, preceded by aerial bombing and shelling, to capture important SPLM\/A-North controlled agricultural areas, Al-Mardes in Delami county, Al-Azraq in Heiban county and Karkaraya in Um Dorein. Two of those areas were successfully captured by government forces, but Karkaraya was later reclaimed by the rebels. When these areas were under their effective control, government forces and allied militias killed civilians and destroyed civilian property. The attacks continued in April and May 2016 and displaced some 50,000 people from fertile areas according to one estimate by a humanitarian agency. President al-Bashir announced an initial four-month unilateral ceasefire in June 2016, which he subsequently extended until the end of June 2017. There have been very few reports of aerial bombardment since the June 2016 ceasefire and, in comparison to earlier years, the dry season has arrived without government attacks. However, Human Rights Watch has received reports of some indiscriminate shelling on civilian areas by Sudanese armed forces. US Sanctions Relief in 2017 In January 2017, then-US President Barack Obama issued an executive order lifting longstanding US sanctions on Sudan. According to a statement released by the US Treasury, the decision was \u201cthe result of sustained progress by the Government of Sudan on several fronts, including a marked reduction in offensive military activity, a pledge to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan, steps toward improving humanitarian access throughout Sudan, and cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism and addressing regional conflicts.\u201d Within six months or by July 2017, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and government intelligence community members, will issue a report with recommendations to current US president Donald Trump on whether the sanctions revocation should become permanent. The order did not identify clear benchmarks for progress or explicitly require improvements to the human rights situation \u2014 a remarkable oversight considering Sudan\u2019s long, violent and extensively documented record of abuses against civilians. Some progress on the ground, described later in this report, in terms of humanitarian access, has been made since the US and the Sudanese government began new negotiations over the US sanctions in 2016. Sudan\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) issued new regulations on December 15, 2015, which promised that humanitarian work would be facilitated and expedited. However, it is not yet clear how far this access will extend or for how long. At the time of writing, there has not yet been any new access to rebel-held Southern Kordofan or Blue Nile, although Sudanese officials have told at least one senior UN official that she may travel to Kauda, the main town in the rebel-held areas. Human Rights Watch has urged the US to adopt a set of human rights benchmarks to guide its assessment of Sudan, and to delay the final assessment to provide meaningful opportunity to determine if there has been real, lasting progress. Six months is not sufficient time for meaningful progress in the areas mentioned in the executive order, or for improvements in the human rights situation. The benchmarks to measure Sudan\u2019s progress should include an end to indiscriminate bombing and shelling, tangible improvements in humanitarian access, release of arbitrarily-held prisoners by the National Intelligence and Security Services, an end to use of lethal force to suppress protests and various law reforms. Regardless of decisions on broad economic sanctions, US relations should not be normalized without significant progress on human rights. US government officials should also carefully review the sanctions policy, with an eye on more effective measures over the long term, continuing to enforce existing individual targeted sanctions against those deemed responsible for serious abuses and consider additional designations, particularly in light of the overwhelming evidence of abuses by the Rapid Support Forces and National Intelligence and Security Service. Obstruction of Humanitarian Aid The food situation here is terrible, sometimes we have nothing to eat; if there is, we eat once a day, even the children. \u2014 Khaltouma Bashir, a 20-year-old woman currently nursing a breastfeeding baby, December 2016.[24] In protracted conflicts all over the region, civilians depend on humanitarian assistance to ensure they can secure sufficient food and access health care, and rely on assistance to provide basic schooling. All the women interviewed for this report, as well as NGO workers, other humanitarians and authorities in the rebel-held areas were especially concerned about current food shortages, a result of poor rains, conflict in high food-production areas, increasing restrictions on traders from government-held areas and South Sudan\u2019s massive currency inflation, which has led to much-increased prices for basic commodities in markets in South Sudan. There is general agreement that food shortages by mid-2017 may be as bad as those in late 2011 and 2012, when people reportedly died of hunger. A report issued in early 2017 has warned that crop production in 2017 may be even lower than in 2016, when poor rains led to small harvests. Independent monitors projected 2017\u2019s harvest to only provide enough food in some areas to last through March in South Kordofan and through May in Blue Nile. The USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network has predicted that areas currently in \u201ccrisis\u201d status, including rebel-held Southern Kordofan, will deteriorate to \u201cemergency,\u201d one level above famine, between June and September 2017. Hard-to-reach areas that are controlled by the SPLM\/A-North may be particularly impacted. A news release issued by the humanitarian wing of the rebel movement in March 2017 said that people in the Kau-Nyaru area only have roots and leaves to eat. Some interviewees said that they were already running low on food and unable to afford the little food available in markets. \u201cWe had planted and harvested but when we fled attacks [including bombing], we did not bring any of it with us. We used to produce surplus but now we have almost nothing,\u201d Nur Amin, 40 years old and displaced from the high-production area of Mardais, said. Volunteer teachers have kept schools open but most have few or no supplies. Civilians have continued to flee bombardment and move to escape hunger. For example, in the first half of 2016, 7,500 people left Southern Kordofan for overcrowded refugee camps in South Sudan. Within the area, tens of thousands of people are living in displacement. The government repeatedly denied access to rebel-held areas to United Nations and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) requesting permission to assess needs and provide aid from within Sudan (\u201ccross line,\u201d i.e. across front lines, assistance), despite multiple requests by the UN, especially in the first six months of the conflict. In August 2011, after two months of UN requests for better access, President al-Bashir said that no international agencies would be allowed to work in rebel-held areas. The government has also insisted, citing sovereignty, that aid agencies cannot enter rebel-held Sudan bordering South Sudan and Ethiopia in the form of \u201ccross-border\u201d aid. These restrictions created a de facto blockade of international humanitarian aid to rebel-held areas of both Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. The government has also made travel to rebel-held areas difficult and stopped flights and cars from traveling to those areas. It bombed two key airstrips in rebel-held towns in the first month of the conflict. Staff from UN agencies also struggled to get the required permits to travel to government-held areas of the state and only a few UN international staff could work there, and sometimes no international staff from international NGOs were allowed to visit or live there. In May 2016, the government issued a new set of directives putting further onerous restrictions on aid agencies seeking access to government-held areas. These include establishing three layers of permission for travel to government-held areas of Darfur and requiring that humanitarian NGOs \u201cshall commit not to disseminate information, data and statistics relating to humanitarian work reports and surveys without returning to the government Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC).\u201d The Sudanese government under President al-Bashir\u2019s National Congress Party has a long history of obstruction and hostility toward independent humanitarian agencies seeking to provide impartial and life-saving humanitarian assistance in Sudan. The government repeatedly used an array of strategies to delay, limit and deny access by humanitarian agencies to civilians in need of assistance during the long civil war from the 1980s to 2005. Flight bans, denials or massive delays in the processing of travel permits, limitations on the numbers of staff and unnecessarily bureaucratic or arbitrary procedures for importing and transporting relief materials have all been common Sudanese government tactics to restrict aid to civilian populations. These policies contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from famine and diseases, and led to international pressure on the Sudanese government to cooperate with Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), a cross-border UN-led relief operation that accessed much of southern Sudan in the 1990s. The Nuba Mountains was, however, excluded from the OLS operation; even during the OLS years, agencies were only able to operate clandestinely. In the 1990s, a famine there killed thousands of people. In May 2006, Human Rights Watch reported on widespread intimidation, arbitrary obstruction and denials of access by the Sudanese government, including its Humanitarian Aid Commission, during the conflict in Darfur. In March 2009, the government of Sudan expelled 13 international agencies and revoked the permits for three national NGOs working in Darfur. In June 2012, the Sudanese government expelled another four agencies from eastern Sudan. The government expelled four senior UN workers between 2014 and 2016, including the head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). These examples represent only some of a broader pattern of expulsions. International and national NGOs, including humanitarian providers, have also been shut down. Although this tense environment was a disincentive for individual aid agencies to seek improved access to rebel-held Southern Kordofan, significant efforts were made by international actors collectively. On February 9, 2012, the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League jointly proposed a \u201cTripartite Agreement\u201d for the provision of international humanitarian assistance to the civilian populations in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Both sides finally agreed to the deal in August 2012 with their own conditions, but no serious progress on implementing the accord was ever made. UN and US government officials blamed the Sudanese government for this failure. In November 2012, the agreement expired without facilitating any assistance. In the same month, a senior Sudan government official stated: \u201cthere is no humanitarian crisis in war-torn South Kordofan and Blue Nile.\u201d In 2013, OCHA, the UN Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization initiated a new effort to vaccinate children in the rebel-held areas. The agencies estimate that some 162,000 children under five years of age live in the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile and have not had access to routine vaccinations since the conflict began in 2011. The UN Security Council backed the plan. The parties initially agreed in theory to a two-week cessation of hostilities in November 2013, but ultimately failed to agree on modalities for the transport of vaccines. \u201cI think it is fair to say both sides have made a lot of effort, but neither side took the last mile in order for it all to happen\u201d, a senior UN official told Human Rights Watch in 2014. Negotiations have continued, but no further progress has been made. Sudan has offered some humanitarian aid to the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan, but, at least in the first years of negotiations, only via government assistance or NGOs closely affiliated to the government, such as the Sudan Red Crescent. The SPLM\/A-North has rejected this form of assistance saying it is not impartial. The government indicated some willingness to allow international agencies into the areas in recent years, on the condition of controlling all service delivery. However, none of these negotiating positions were ever tested. The SPLM\/A-North has however encouraged international NGOs and Nuba NGOs to operate in the rebel-held areas. These groups have brought critical medical assistance in from across international borders. Although patchy, these services\u2014operating outside of officially sanctioned channels\u2014represent the only services civilians and injured rebel fighters can access without leaving their homes for a refugee camp or becoming displaced in government-controlled Sudan. In early to mid-2015, the head of the AUHIP, former South African president Thabo Mbeki, proposed another way to break the deadlock. He suggested that both parties agree that a proportion of aid would enter the rebel-held areas from within Sudan, and a proportion from Ethiopia, cross-border. The SPLM\/A-North agreed to as much as 80 percent of humanitarian aid entering the area cross-line, i.e. from within Sudan, and 20 percent from Ethiopia. The SPLM\/A-North told Human Rights Watch that they considered this to be a major concession. The Sudan government rejected the deal, and said again that no aid could enter from other countries into rebel-held areas. In late 2016, in response to this deadlock, the US government offered to provide humanitarian assistance from within Sudan, consisting of only US government aid, delivered by US government-funded international humanitarian groups. However, the SPLM\/A-North did not accept this offer, instead asking for further negotiations and again demanding cross border aid. Rebel leaders say cross border aid is important because, firstly, they want to be able to safely transport wounded fighters to medical assistance in neighboring countries. Rebel leaders said, secondly, that Sudan\u2019s history of aid obstruction and human rights violations against Nuba has meant that both the rebel leadership and civilians have lost trust that aid controlled by Khartoum will be safe\u2014one doctor told Human Rights Watch that he believes many Nuba civilians would, for example, refuse vaccinations from Sudan\u2014 or reliable, i.e. not subject to further obstruction and interference. Following the US decision to provide sanctions relief, the Sudanese government also said that it would allow UN staff to travel to rebel-held areas and it appears that at the time of this report\u2019s publication that the major impediment to UN access to rebel-held areas is the SPLM\/A-North. Regarding access to government-held areas, Sudan has made nominal progress. Sudan\u2019s HAC issued new regulations on December 15, 2016. These promised that humanitarian work would be facilitated and expedited. However, government-approved travel permits are still necessary for conflict-affected areas and humanitarians must notify government authorities before traveling to any location outside of the capital. International humanitarians have subsequently been able to assess needs and deliver assistance in parts of Darfur\u2019s Jebel Mara area now controlled by the government. At the time of writing, there has been not yet been any change to actual access to rebel-held Southern Kordofan or Blue Nile. Women\u2019s Rights in Rebel-Held Areas of Southern Kordofan You are told to hush, not to talk. \u2014 Zeinab Mohammed displaced and living in Lula village, Heiban County, December 2016.[56] Women have no voice. We have no voice here. You could get into politics, maybe, but only if you are educated. \u2014 Afaf Saeed, displaced and living in Lula village, Heiban County, December 2016.[57] As described below, women and girls in rebel-held Southern Kordofan face discrimination and violence, and have limited avenues for redress. All the women interviewed for this report felt that women\u2019s rights were either at a standstill, or were going backward. Often women said they felt undervalued, including in their lack of voice or influence in their family lives, communities or in the SPLM\/A-North administration. Women face multiple barriers to full participation in public life, including in the peace processes. The people we interviewed said that in rebel-held Southern Kordofan child marriage is common and families often value educating their sons over their daughters. In some areas, many families still practice female genital mutilation (FGM). Women experiencing domestic violence lack legal protections, including against rape in marriage. A 2016 NGO report on women\u2019s rights and gender in the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan concluded that \u201cthe SPLM\/A-N remains a traditional male-dominated and militarized movement with no clear agenda for delivering on their rhetorical commitments to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls \u2026 (they are) to a large extent gender-blind and with strong patriarchal tendencies.\u201d Political Participation There are three women represented at the intermittent peace talks. Only one of the women interviewed in the rebel-held areas had information about what was happening with the peace process, and all said they felt there was no way for women\u2019s voices to influence the talks. Nuba women fight in the rebel army and occupy some positions in local government, including leading two of the secretariats in the civilian administration; however, none of the seven commissioners or top leadership are women, and the SPLM\/A-North\u2019s 25 percent quota for administrative positions for women has not been met. Some women said they felt many men now consider 25 percent as a ceiling rather than a floor for female participation. \u201cWe are so far behind, there are no women\u2019s rights here. Women have no respect, the [SPLM\/A-North] promises are all just talk,\u201d a Nuba female social worker working with an NGO said. There have not been any elections in the area since the war began and there are unlikely to be any soon. The SPLM\/A-North women\u2019s association is large and widespread but there are no independent women\u2019s rights organizations or networks. Early Marriage In the rebel-held areas families often marry off their daughters early, especially if the family cannot afford to send some or all of their children to school. Some interviewees said that sometimes, especially when they were displaced from villages, there was no nearby school available. \u201cEarly marriage is common. No one is trying to stop it. About 14 or 15 is normal, much worse since the war because there\u2019s no money,\u201d Hanasi Mohsin, who works for the social development secretariat in Heiban town, said. Of the 25 women interviewed, 14 of them had married before they were 18 years of age, most guessed or said they were around 15 years of age, and two of them were married as soon as they had started menstruating. All over the world, child marriage often leads to early childbearing with attendant health risks and disrupts or ends a girl\u2019s formal schooling. Sudan\u2019s law allows marriage at 14 years for both boys and girls. Access to Education Interviewees said that when resources are limited, they prioritize education of boys over girls. \u201cI\u2019ve had 11 children, five girls are surviving and three are married, they are 15, 16 and 17 years old. They were not able to go to school because we have no money. The boys are going to school,\u201d 41-year-old Aisha Hussein said. \u201cBoys are treated better, because when he grows up he will provide for the family through a job while the girl will marry into another family,\u201d Afaf Saeed, a mother of two children, said. Khaltouma Bashir, who was uncertain of her age but looked around 15 or 16 years of age, married a soldier in part because there was no money for her to go to school. \u201cMy brothers did go, but there was not enough for me. I was just idle so decided to go for marriage,\u201d she said. Several of the women interviewed identified education as the most important path for women to get authority and influence. \u201cEducation is the one thing that has to change for us to get our rights,\u201d Amal Tutu, mother of five children, said. A 30-year-old NGO worker, well-known in the Nuba humanitarian community, and newly-married, said, \u201cI wanted to be able to finish my schooling and then get a job which is why I didn\u2019t get married. No other way.\u201d Female Genital Mutilation The civilian administration has done some work to end female genital mutilation (FGM), which is common in some areas closer to government-controlled parts of Southern Kordofan. All women and girls interviewed in Hadara village, Delami county, said that they, their sisters, and all the women and girls they knew, had clitorodectomies as young children. (FGM was not reported in any of the other sites of research.) Sudan has a startlingly high national prevalence of FGM, just under 87 percent according to joint UN and government research. Restrictions on access to aid have meant that women and girls in the rebel-held area have been unable to benefit from efforts by the government and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners to end the practice. Domestic Violence The SPLM\/A-North Secretariat of Social Development and Women\u2019s Rights, together with the women\u2019s association, has worked to tackle domestic violence in at least Heiban and Delami counties, including through holding meetings with the community and asking senior people from the civilian administration to address the issue in public. \u201cThere was a gathering and we were all warned by the chief,\u201d Rabha Yabus, a 30-year-old from the area, said, \u201cI was beaten but now my husband has stopped.\u201d However, domestic violence cases are still reported to local organization staff and civil servants. One woman who worked for the local civilian administration said that she had to find transport to hospital up to six times a month for women who had been seriously beaten by their husbands. \u201cRecently a woman was cut badly on her skull, another one the skull was dented,\u201d she said. Six of the 25 interviewees, from different counties, said that their husbands beat them. One of them, Amal Tutu, said: Women\u2019s rights are going backwards. Even when you want to express yourself you are not listened to. Even when you\u2019re very tired your husband can make you get up and do your work. I have been beaten when I resist many times. Five others said that their neighbors, relatives or women they knew well were also beaten. Lack of Legal Protections The SPLM\/A-North areas use the \u201cNew Sudan\u201d laws and penal code, which punishes rape with up to 14 years of imprisonment and a fine. There are no other provisions in force that specifically protect women against gender-based violence. The justice system in rebel-held areas is mostly staffed by volunteers with little or no training. There are about 1,500 volunteer police working in the rebel-held Nuba mountains\u2014only a small proportion of whom are women\u2014and they have had no specific training or protocols on handling or investigating gender-based violence. The rebel-held region has 21 volunteer judges who have not had any recent training, but no prosecutors or lawyers. The head of the judiciary, Kodi Abd Rahman Harik, said that as far as he was aware, there had been no trials of perpetrators of domestic violence since 2011 and only one case of rape. International doctors working in the area said that they had treated a few rape cases over the years. Women\u2019s rights advocates said they believe rape in marriage is fairly common, and six of the 25 women interviewed said that they had no choice but to have sex when their husbands wanted to. \u201cYou can say no if you\u2019re menstruating, otherwise you have to do it,\u201d a 35-year-old woman, Amal Ali, said. \u201cYou have to have sex when he wants, if you refuse you might be caned. This has happened to my neighbors. For me, whether you like it or not, you do it,\u201d another woman explained. Under the \u201cNew Sudan\u201d laws, non-consensual sex, or sex against a woman\u2019s will, is not rape if the man is married to the woman. Only one health NGO provides post-rape care that includes the provision of emergency contraception if requested as outlined by World Health Organization standards. None of the women interviewed knew that seeking medical attention is important after rape. There is no counselling or long-term psychological support available in rebel-held areas, including for survivors of sexual violence.\nII. A Weak Health System Decades of conflict and marginalization by Sudan\u2019s government left Southern Kordofan state\u2019s health system underdeveloped even before the current war began. Subsequent obstruction of humanitarian aid has meant that there has been no coordinated humanitarian relief effort to ameliorate the negative impact of an abusive conflict on the healthcare services available to the population there. Humanitarian organizations estimate that there are some 900,000 people living in rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan (and a small area of neighboring Western Kordofan state). Only roughly 650,000 of them are accessible to aid workers. Largely volunteer-run clinics in the rebel-held area often lack supplies, and health workers, including midwives, have little formal training or capacity. Hospitals and clinics, which appear to have been specifically targeted, have also been damaged by aerial bombardment by Sudanese government planes. Weak Health Infrastructure in Rebel-Held Southern Kordofan In many clinics, there\u2019s not even Tylenol. \u2014Hospital Director, Mother of Mercy Hospital, Heiban county, December 2016.[84] Women, men and children living in rebel-held Nuba mountains have not had access to Sudanese government health services or unhindered humanitarian aid since the conflict began in 2011. The availability of health care facilities and skilled health care providers in rebel-held South Kordofan falls far short of the need. In 2006, the World Health Organization set the standard for delivery of essential maternal and child health services at a minimum of 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000 people, while the International Labour Organization (ILO) sets the standard at 34.5 skilled health professionals per 10,000. In 2013, research by WHO and the US Agency for International Development said 59.4 skilled health professionals per 10,000 were needed to end preventable maternal deaths. For an estimated population of about a 900,000 people, the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan has only five doctors. There is no gynecologist or obstetrician in the rebel-held area. There are only two working hospitals, the Mother of Mercy Hospital run by the Diocese of El Obeid, also known as \u201cGidel,\u201d (435 beds) and the smaller Cap Anamur - German Emergency Doctors\u2019 (GED) hospital in Loweri (70 beds). Both hospitals are in Heiban county, which can be a long journey\u2014several hours or even two days\u2014even by car from other parts of the rebel-held areas. Sometimes, because of active frontlines, the hospitals are entirely inaccessible. These hospitals are the only facilities with the staff and equipment for surgery, treatment of serious wounds, and medical testing. Doctors working in these hospitals told Human Rights Watch that they regularly treat civilians or combatants who had reached the hospital only after lengthy journeys. There are no ambulances in the rebel-held areas and very few civilian cars. As discussed later in this report, this is a major problem for women trying to access healthcare, including in emergencies such as complications during labor. The SPLM\/A-North secretariat of health runs around 175 clinics across the area that provide basic health care. None of the secretariat staff receive a salary. While this network of clinics means that, in theory, most communities are served by one, the clinics are typically staffed by volunteer nurses or community health workers, who often have no or only basic training. The clinics lack basic equipment like weighing scales or test kits. Rapid tests for malaria are the exception. Chronic shortages of medicines and difficulties in transporting them mean that basic medicines to treat malaria, worm infections and respiratory diseases are often not available. \u201cIn 2015 for a period we ran out of malaria drugs, seven people died, they came to the clinic but we had nothing to give them,\u201d Gadam Ali, who runs the health secretariat in Delami county as a volunteer, said. \u201cWe never have any drugs for TB or leprosy.\u201d All the community clinics that Human Rights Watch researchers visited in December 2016 were experiencing shortages of essential medicines or key equipment. \u201cThe amoxicillin [an important antibiotic] is finished and we have no more medicines for urinary tract infections, which are very common here,\u201d James Atai, a trained nurse in charge of the Hadara clinic, in Delami county, little more than a room with medicines on a table, said. The inadequacy of health services extends to key preventive care. Only a few facilities provide vaccinations, and child vaccination coverage is extremely low in part because of a lack of refrigerators. In Hadara village, for example, health workers and local women leaders said almost none of the children have been vaccinated because the village is located far away from clinics with vaccinations. A major outbreak of measles in 2014 and 2015 involved at least two thousand suspected cases, and killed at least 30 children. The Sudanese government, UNICEF, and WHO conduct mass vaccination campaigns in non-conflict areas of Sudan. No such campaign has been conducted in rebel-held Southern Kordofan since 2010. Attacks Targeting Health Services Human Rights Watch documented six attacks on hospitals and clinics, including all the major health providers in the SPLM\/A-North controlled area, between April and June 2014. The pattern of the attacks on healthcare facilities and the presence of drones over the facilities ahead of the attacks on three occasions, suggests that the hospitals may have been deliberately targeted, which would constitute a war crime. In these strikes, two patients were killed. These attacks also had an impact on available health services. Soon after attacks on their hospital in Buram county in 2014, the medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) (Doctors Without Borders) pulled out staff, eventually forcing their Buram hospital to close. Another major clinic, one of the few providing obstetric care, also closed in 2014 following the attacks. In total, around 20 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in bombing raids over towns since 2011, according to the SPLM\/A-North health secretariat. Johannes Plate, a health worker at the Loweri hospital, said that airplanes attacked the hospital area in 2014, 2015 and 2016. He said that these incidents scared people away from seeking health services: \u201cThere would be an immediate drop in outpatients, from about 200 a day to none, for about a week and then forty to fifty people a day in the following weeks. Even inpatients leave,\u201d he said.\nIII. Lack of Access to Reproductive Healthcare I had a miscarriage at five months, of twins. They came out and then there was a lot of bleeding, a lot of pain. There was no car, no painkillers. I had to walk to the hospital because the bleeding would not stop. \u2014 Amal Tutu, who lives in a village in Heiban County, said her home is about a day\u2019s walk from the nearest hospital, December 2016.[98] The conflict has resulted in a further weakening of already sparse women\u2019s healthcare services in the area, with tragic consequences for girls and women. The women and girls that Human Rights Watch interviewed have few options for controlling their fertility, and many go through multiple pregnancies beginning at a young age, including as a result of child marriage. These factors raise the risk of pregnancy-related complications, as do overall poor health, including poor nutrition and Infibulation, a form of FGM common in Sudan, where the vagina is stitched or otherwise narrowed. This form of FGM can cause obstructed labor and is a main cause of obstetric fistula and maternal mortality in Sudan. Pregnant women have extremely limited access to skilled health providers, vitamins and essential medicines, quality antenatal care, and emergency obstetric care. These factors increase the risk of being injured or dying from complications due to pregnancy and childbirth. Using population estimates from humanitarian groups working in the area and WHO estimates for Sudan\u2019s birth rates (not disaggregated by region), we can estimate that perhaps around 33,500 births are taking place every year. Bombing raids have stopped women from accessing care, including making antenatal visits. Four women interviewed by Human Rights Watch also said that they believed they had had miscarriages late in their pregnancies due to the stress and hardships they underwent when they experienced aerial bombardment. However, we were unable to confirm the medical causes of their miscarriages. Human Rights Watch also found that women and girls had almost no access to contraception to prevent pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Sexual and Reproductive Health in Protracted Crises Hunger: this is the thing people worry about most, this and the bombing deaths and injuries they say is the \u2018emergency.\u2019 But women are dying in childbirth and there is very little healthcare, the schools are getting worse; six years of bad education is a crisis for this generation. Much more is needed to alleviate serious suffering. \u2014 Nuba humanitarian aid worker.[101] For situations of both acute and protracted crises such as armed conflicts or natural disasters, when regular health services may be compromised or ineffective and assistance is required to ensure access to health care, humanitarian groups have developed minimum standards of care to seek to ensure an appropriate and quality humanitarian response. The standards for sexual and reproductive healthcare are outlined below. The Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health (MISP) is \u201ca priority set of lifesaving activities to be implemented at the onset of every emergency\u201d recognized as a Sphere standard in 2004. MISP provides that a reproductive health officer should be in place to coordinate efforts and help collect information; that reproductive health kits (containing medicines and equipment) should be available and used; that clinical care is available for rape victims; and that visibly pregnant women should be given clean delivery equipment. Referral systems for emergencies for women in labor and for newborns should be established and blood transfusions made available. Condoms should also be freely available. (See appendix for more). While the standards foresee that these minimum services should be implemented within the first weeks of a humanitarian response, six years into Southern Kordofan\u2019s conflict, these services do not exist. The Sphere minimum standards in health action set out five benchmarks to assess whether minimum standards are being met: Whether all heath facilities have trained staff, sufficient supplies and equipment for clinical management of rape survivor services based on national or WHO protocols. Whether all pregnant women in their third trimester have received clean delivery kits. Whether there are at least four health facilities per 500,000 people with basic emergency obstetric care and newborn care that women can be referred and transported to. Whether there is at least one health facility with comprehensive emergency obstetric care and newborn care per 500,000 population. Comprehensive emergency obstetric care includes surgery under general anesthesia and safe blood transfusions. Whether the proportion of deliveries by caesarean section is not less than 5 percent or more than 15 percent. In the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan, only one of these indicators is being met, and only partially. The Mother of Mercy (in Gidel) and the GED (in Loweri) hospitals both provide comprehensive emergency care, but neither are easily accessible, or sometimes at all accessible, for most of the population. As shown below in more detail, the other minimum indicators are not being met. There are no delivery kits in the area. Aside from clinics run by either the Diocese of El Obeid or GED, few facilities have basic obstetric medicines or equipment. Authorities and doctors told Human Rights Watch that probably over 99 percent of births take place at home, without skilled or equipped providers. Only two health providers perform caesarean surgeries in their facilities. Between them, the two facilities perform about 100 caesarean sections a year, about 0.2 percent of our roughly estimated number of births in the rebel-held areas, significantly below the Sphere minimum standard benchmark of 5 percent. Humanitarian organizations should \u2013 and increasingly do -work to provide not only emergency services but also help restore or create working healthcare systems. Sexual and reproductive healthcare should be included in these efforts. Maternal Mortality and Morbidity My aunt died in childbirth, they took her to the hospital and she died on the way with the baby in her womb, it was an hour by car. \u2014 Aisha Hussein, Tongoli village, Delami county, December 2016.[108] Low women\u2019s status and poor access to health care has a devastating effect on maternal health. This is accentuated in conflicts: maternal mortality in humanitarian crises and in fragile settings is 1.9 times the world average, and represents 61 percent of the total number of maternal deaths worldwide. Access to antenatal care, skilled healthcare during labor, and emergency obstetric care are critical for preventing maternal deaths and injuries. In the Nuba region, unless pregnant women live within reach of one of the two hospitals or the clinics these two institutions support with staff visits, supplies, and training, these services are out of reach. There are no reliable recent estimates of the number of women and girls dying in childbirth (maternal mortality), or experiencing long-term infections, pregnancy or childbirth-related injuries or disabilities (maternal morbidity), for the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan. However, previous estimates show elevated rates in the state. A joint research effort by the UN and the Sudanese government in 2006 put Southern Kordofan\u2019s maternal mortality rate at 503 per 100,000 live births, compared to 91 per 100,000 births in Northern state and 213 in Southern Kordofan\u2019s neighboring Northern Kordofan state. Maternal mortality decreased nationally in Sudan from 744 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 311 in 2015, but there is little reason to believe that the figure would have declined to the same extent in war torn, rebel-held Southern Kordofan. The little information that is available suggests that maternal mortality remains high. The Mother of Mercy Hospital documented two maternal deaths at their hospital in 2016 and three in 2015, out of about 260 to 280 births a year. GED recorded two maternal deaths at their hospital in 2016, out of 193 deliveries and six maternal deaths that took place at women\u2019s homes in areas near their outreach clinics. Johannes Plate from GED wrote to Human Rights Watch that, \u201cto get confirmed numbers is quite a challenge. But I had a meeting with the SoH [the SPLM\/A-North Secretariat of Health] recently, and they showed me a statistic. There [sic] have confirmed, that around 350 women died in 2016, and were guessing that most of them were pregnant.\u201d Most maternal deaths are preventable. Johannes Plate from GED said: Unfortunately, most cases are arriving in the hospital too late; an unknown number is dying at home or on the road... We figured out, that the main complication is prolonged delivery. That is caused by many reasons, but most of them would be treatable, if the woman previously had been examined by a midwife or would come to deliver at the hospital. To sort out high-risk pregnancies, like twin pregnancies, suspected eclampsia, narrow pelvic, teen pregnancies or multipara, regular ANC\u2019s [antenatal care] are needed. But most of the women are only visiting the ANC, once they are feeling sick. The undiscovered cases will deliver at home, in case of a complication the next health unit is too far and the means of transport are rare. Lack of Access to Adequate Antenatal Care Pregnant women in rebel-held Nuba Mountains who live within access of either the GED hospital or Mother of Mercy Hospital, or one of their outreach clinics, can access antenatal care from trained and equipped providers. Others must make do with little or no care at all. Between a third to half of all maternal deaths are due to causes, such as hypertension (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia) and hemorrhage, directly related to inadequate care during pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends that during each pregnancy women make a minimum of four antenatal care visits that provide them with essential evidence-based interventions. Essential medical assistance includes identification and management of obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia, tetanus toxoid immunizations, treatment for malaria and sexually transmitted infection identification and management (for example, syphilis). A visit at the end of the pregnancy is important to help find and manage complications such as multiple births and abnormal positions of the baby. Antenatal care is also important to connect the pregnant woman to healthcare providers and to provide her with information on where contraception is available, the importance of skilled attendance at birth, breastfeeding, early care for the baby, and birth spacing. In Nuba, most village clinics (run by the rebel administration) in the rebel-held area lack the staff, the vitamins and medicines (at least in consistent supply), and the equipment to provide full antenatal care. Almost half of the interviewed women that had given birth in the last four years said they had relied on village midwives for antenatal care, or did not have any antenatal care at all during their pregnancies. Most of the midwives in the area are traditional birth attendants, rather than trained midwives. None of the midwives or traditional birth attendants who treated the women interviewed in their home villages had equipment such as stethoscopes. \u201c[The midwife] has no equipment, only her hands. She did not listen to the baby. I had no medicines or vitamins and she did not have anything to give me either,\u201d Samia said. In some cases, midwives had advised women interviewed that they should go to the hospital to give birth, either because of the patient\u2019s history or because the midwife was able to determine that she might face problems. \u201cSometimes [midwives or traditional birth attendants] can feel that the baby is not in the right place and then can send mother to Gidel [Mother of Mercy Hospital],\u201d Hadara village clinic manager, James Atai, said. \u201cBut normally when they decide to go to Gidel, the mother already has problems.\u201d Health officials said that folic acid, a vitamin supplement in pill form, is the only supplement delivered regularly to the secretariat of health clinics; iron and other vitamins are provided irregularly. Anemia from a lack of iron, often a cause of maternal mortality, may be very common, one doctor said, based on high rates of anemia amongst his patients. Clinics are also usually supplied with quinine, which can be given to women in their first trimester for malaria. However, the main doctor in Loweri hospital said that malaria was still suspected to be the main cause of stillbirths at his facility. Hypertension, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia is another major cause of illness and death during pregnancy (as well as delivery). But very few clinics have instruments to measure blood pressure; for example, in Delami county, none of the secretariats of health clinics have a sphygmomanometer, which uses an inflatable cuff wrapped around the patient\u2019s upper arm. None of the clinics have received basic instruments such as weighing scales, stethoscopes, or fetoscopes since the war began. Most women we interviewed said they experienced hunger at least at some point during their pregnancy. A lack of food and nutrition during pregnancy can cause illnesses in pregnant women, including anemia, and lead to low birth weights and poor early development for their babies. There are no supplemental feeding programs in the rebel-held areas. \u201cBecause of the fighting, we had to flee. I was often hungry in the last three months [of my pregnancy],\u201d Afaf Saeed, a 25-year-old former cleaner said, \u201cmany days there was only a handful of food.\u201d Women who live close to one of the two hospitals or their outreach clinics, or who can find transport or walk to visit the facilities, said they received antenatal care. GED recorded 14,371 antenatal visits to its hospital and outreach clinics in 2016. The Mother of Mercy Hospital said they had 777 admissions to their maternity ward in 2016, mostly commonly for miscarriage, prolonged labor, antepartum bleeding, malaria and neonatal sepsis. Several of the women interviewed ensured they got checkups, despite considerable distances to hospitals. Ten of the women interviewed went to about four checkups during their pregnancies, and had waited for cars or walked to Mother of Mercy Hospital or the Cap Anamur - German Emergency Doctors (GED), \u2013 which is usually around a day there and a day back walking. \u201cGidel [Mother of Mercy] is about one or two hours if you can get a car from Heiban to there. I was hungry a lot at the time [when walking and staying there],\u201d Afaf Saeed, a 25-year-old woman with two children said, but added it turned out to have been crucial, perhaps life-saving, that she made this strenuous effort. She found out during the checkups that she should give birth in the hospital because her blood was \u201ctoo weak\u201d to safely deliver at home. Of all the 25 women interviewed, only those who had used the Mother of Mercy\u2019s antenatal care had slept under a mosquito net, given to them at their first visit, while pregnant. No other organization provides subsidized or free nets, in large part because of the high cost of transporting these bulkier items. Sonograms are available in both hospitals. Khadija el Hajj told Human Rights Watch that visiting the Mother of Mercy Hospital for a sonogram might have saved her life. The doctor was able to see that her baby had a swollen head. Under his advice, she went to the hospital for a cesarean section where she had a safe delivery. At the time of the interview, the baby was still in treatment. Babies born in the GED Loweri hospital receive a Hepatitis B vaccine when they are born \u2013 as well as the usual early childhood vaccines \u2013 because health workers found after testing that 12.5 percent of women using the facility over nine months in 2016 have the disease. The Mother of Mercy Hospital in Gidel recently began testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B in their antenatal clinic and found about 20 percent of these women were positive. \u201cWe immunize those babies immediately after birth and are encouraging their mothers to deliver at the hospital,\u201d said , the senior doctor working there. Pregnant women or girls who visit Diocese of el Obeid facilities, including six outreach clinics, have checkups that include measuring the mother\u2019s weight and blood pressure, testing (and if necessary, treatment) for HIV and hepatitis B, and provision of medicines to prevent malaria and tetanus immunization. Six GED outreach clinics also provide consultations that include blood pressure and weight measurements and most also provide tetanus vaccines and anti-malarials. Vaccinations are not available in most places as few clinics have refrigerators to store them. Human Rights Watch spoke to four women who attributed their miscarriages and early births to the hardships and stress they underwent while experiencing aerial bombardment. The causes of miscarriage are complex and Human Rights Watch does not have the information or medical expertise to assess what happened in these cases. However, many people in the community said they felt there was a link. A medical organization working in areas in Syria where aerial bombardment is common told Human Rights Watch \u201cour field teams have documented both miscarriages and pre-term births as a result of ongoing bombing.\u201d A doctor from another medical organization was more circumspect, saying \u201ctraumatic events like bombings and attacks are creating stressful situations leading to early births, that occasionally can result in miscarriages.\u201d A 2013 news release from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said that \u201camongst pregnant women, miscarriages and pre-term births are on the rise because of the stress caused by the conflict,\u201d but did not directly attribute the increase in miscarriages to bombardment, although this stressor was mentioned. \u201cIt happened to me, in 2013, I was seven months pregnant. I ran to the foxhole when the plane came, came out and two days later I gave birth,\u201d 41-year-old Aisha Hussein said, \u201cthe baby died.\u201d Another woman, Mujuma Hamad, working as a medicine dispenser in Hadara village in Delami county, said she miscarried immediately after an Antonov attack when she was eight months pregnant. She said that she knew six other women in the village who miscarried at or around the time when aerial bombardments had taken place. A social development administration worker in charge of women\u2019s affairs in Heiban town said that since the war began in 2011, she knew at least seven women who had miscarried soon after aerial bombardment. The information manager for the secretariat of health said that she recorded three miscarriages in Kauda town in 2014 that had taken place when planes flew over threatening an attack, and that she also received a report that four women miscarried during aerial bombardment attacks in Mendi in 2015. Emergency Obstetric Care: The Three Delays Hundreds of thousands of women live too far from the GED hospital or Mother of Mercy Hospital to be able to access emergency obstetric care. But even for those who do live within reach of the two hospitals, delays stop them from accessing these services. Health experts highlight the importance of having a skilled health care provider during and after childbirth, and typically explain the contributing factors to maternal deaths and morbidity using the \u201cthree delays model.\u201d The first delay follows the failure to recognize the need for emergency obstetric care, or when a decision is made, to not access emergency services. Undertrained midwives, or family members in the absence of health workers, can be slower than fully trained personnel to notice danger signs and ensure timely referral. In the rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan, the extreme difficulties of finding and organizing transport and at times bombing raids, may stop women and their families from quickly choosing to get the patient to a hospital or clinic as soon as possible. The second delay is when women arrive late to the referral facility, including when the facility is too far away to access quickly or when transportation is unavailable. A woman experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, which accounts for around 25 percent of maternal deaths globally, is at high risk of dying within two hours of onset without immediate intervention. Women experiencing other problems, such as hypertension or obstructed labor, may have a longer window, of up to two days, to reach lifesaving care, in most cases. In the rebel-held areas, if women and girls face emergency complications during childbirth, they may be many hours or days away from lifesaving assistance. \u201cIn many cases women come from far to give birth, sometimes two days walking, sometimes the baby died on the way,\u201d a GED midwife, Dahabaya Khamis, said. There are no ambulances in the region and mobile phone networks only work on some of the fringes of rebel-held areas. Since the war began, the number of cars has declined and authorities in places Human Rights Watch visited said there are typically only one or two cars even in the main towns and usually no cars in villages. \u201cIf I have an emergency when I give birth, if I find a car I am about an hour from the hospital,\u201d Aisha Hussein, one of the women interviewed, said. \u201cThere were a lot of cars before the war. Now it\u2019s hard to find one.\u201d Families often end up carrying women in obstructed labor on a bed, local officials told Human Rights Watch. Four women told researchers that this would be their only option if they faced complications in labor. The head of the health secretariat in the county of Delami said this is a fairly common practice. \u201cWe can do nothing here \u2026 there is a car usually in Tujur to then go to Gidel, about three hours by foot, by bed, with a group of not less than 10 men. And sometimes the cars are not there, or one is broken down,\u201d he said. The executive director of Heiban county said: It is very common that women can\u2019t reach in time and die in childbirth at home. To get to Gidel is about six to seven hours if you climb across the hills, a one-day walk if you go through Kauda way. The child often dies. We use a bed to carry the woman to the hospital, a group of men carry her. Sometimes from the villages to here like this, and then they try and find a car. They go to the commissioner, but he\u2019s not always here and sometimes he has no fuel. This happens between 5 and 10 times a month. Then we face a lack of blood when they give birth. \u201cSometimes we see a woman who has been in labor for three days and she\u2019s just arrived,\u201d a foreign doctor told Human Rights Watch. One woman, Amal Tutu, miscarried twins and then had to walk a day to the hospital when the bleeding did not stop even though she was weak. \u201cThere was no car, no painkillers. I was in pain but I knew that the local clinic would not be able to deal with it,\u201d she said. She was treated at the hospital. Hawa Zeitoun, who is about 14 or 15 years old, spent the last two months of her pregnancy at the Mother of Mercy Hospital because she had complications, and she feared if she waited at home, she would not be able to manage the one-day walk to reach the facility. The third delay is caused when the facility does not have sufficiently trained staff or is inadequately equipped. In rebel-held areas of Southern Kordofan, the only facilities fully equipped to handle obstetric emergencies are Loweri or the Mother of Mercy hospitals. The Mother of Mercy Hospital has a blood bank and a team of experts including anesthesiologists, and both hospitals can provide women with transfusions. Both the Mother of Mercy and GED Loweri can perform cesarean sections as well as provide all basic emergency care, including specialized antibiotics, oxytocin and anticonvulsants, manual removal of the placenta and assisted vaginal delivery. GED provides support to six outreach clinics and only one does not have a midwife on staff who is trained to manage manual removal of the placenta, umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord emerges in birth before the fetus), breech delivery and other complications; in two clinics, staff can remove material from inside the uterus. Six other clinics are supported by the Diocese of El Obeid, who also run the Mother of Mercy Hospital in Gidel, where midwives on staff provide manual placenta removal, although they do not perform assisted (i.e. vacuum or forceps assisted) deliveries. Oxytocin and antibiotics are available, including via a drip in one clinic. Otherwise, few health facilities are equipped to manage emergencies even if women can reach them. For example, misoprostol, which can be a life-saving medicine in cases of post-partum hemorrhage or miscarriage, is generally not available except in the two hospitals and a few clinics. Midwives are often inadequately equipped and trained. Most women in Nuba give birth at home. All but four of all the women interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave birth where they were living, either permanently or while displaced by fighting, usually on the ground but sometimes on a bed. \u201cThere was dust blowing all over me,\u201d Afaf Saeed, who was living in displacement near a riverbed a few hours\u2019 walk from Heiban town because of aerial bombardment at the time, remembered. Often women said in their interviews that they delivered with the assistance of family members, but in about half the cases a midwife was present. \u201cI gave birth at home, I was afraid I would die I was in so much pain, but it was not for too long. The baby was the wrong way around, but the midwife could adjust the baby before the birth,\u201d Samia Mohammed said. Even when a trained midwife can attend a birth, she often does not have access to equipment, like forceps, sometimes lost or destroyed in the war. For example, the midwife in Hadara village in Delami county said her kit burned with all her possessions when much of the town was burned in May 2015 by government forces. There has been no large-scale training or re-training of midwives in the area, or in neighboring South Sudan, and no large effort to resupply them with equipment since the war began. In humanitarian crises where women tend to give birth at home rather than in facilities, humanitarian organizations try to provide women who are visibly pregnant with clean delivery kits (containing soap, a razor blade and cloth among other items). There has been no large-scale distribution of delivery kits for pregnant women in the rebel-held areas since the war began. Simple UN-supplied midwife kits that each cover 50 deliveries and contain basic lifesaving equipment and medicines, are also not available in the rebel-held area. Access to Contraception and Protection against Sexually Transmitted Infections No, no condoms here. We\u2019ve never had them. \u2026 Yes! We know what they are, but we\u2019ve never seen them here, no family planning since the war. \u2014 Staff members of Heiban town\u2019s main clinic, Heiban county, December 2016.[160] Every year we women get really tired of being pregnant and giving birth and there\u2019s not enough food either, not enough vegetables to feed all the children. So, they are hungry and we\u2019re worried about the situation all the time, there\u2019s no option for a change. \u2014 Raja Ibrahim, women\u2019s rights and civil society leader, December 2016.[161] What is a \u2018condom\u2019? \u2014 Khadija al Haj, mother of one, Lula village, Heiban county, December 2016.[162] Family planning, including access to condoms, is largely unavailable in rebel-held Southern Kordofan state, largely due to the overall gaps in health infrastructure and services, and in part because the major healthcare provider does not provide contraception. This has meant that women are unable to control the number and spacing of their pregnancies or plan their families either individually, or together with partners, to the detriment to their well-being and health. The area\u2019s apparently high number of early marriages makes the lack of access to contraception even more dangerous; for girls between 15 and 19 years old, complications due to pregnancy and childbirth is the second leading cause of death globally. Multiple births can endanger the mother\u2019s health and women who have more than four children are at increased risk of maternal mortality. The low levels of condom availability in the areas also means men and women are less able to protect themselves from sexually-transmitted infections. Access to Contraception in the Rebel-Held Area There is nothing you can do if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant. \u2014 Khadija al Haj, Lula village, Heiban County, December 2016. Human Rights Watch interviewed all the main health providers and found that women and girls have few or no options for controlling their fertility. Overall access to reproductive health information and services is weak. The largest hospital and main health center is run by Catholic providers who do not provide contraception. To the extent that limited quantities of contraception are available, a local rule and cultural norms dictate that women must first get the permission of their husbands. There is also a social stigma around using contraception, according to NGO workers and some of the women interviewed. In many settings, women prefer long-acting contraceptives, especially if it is difficult to access health services and supplies easily. Only one provider, GED, provides such services \u2013a three-month injectable contraception. GED also regularly distributes a limited amount of condoms from its small hospital in Loweri, and six outreach clinics. GED recorded 519 visits related to family planning in 2016 in its hospital and outreach clinics. Johannes Plate, who works in the GED hospital, said that women often prefer long-lasting contraception to using condoms but that GED does not provide other options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) or oral contraceptives as women may be displaced or unable to return to the clinic for other reasons. He also said they do not provide contraceptives in pill form as women often do not use it correctly. The Mother of Mercy, the region\u2019s main hospital, does not provide any contraception because the organization is Catholic. None of the rebel secretariats of health clinics provide family planning information or services, and only very occasionally stock condoms, which are not included in regular distributions. One SPLM\/A-North clinic visited by Human Rights Watch did have some condoms but the manager said that he only gives them away one at a time because he is uncertain when or if he will get more. MSF, which provided family planning services, closed its clinics after they were bombed in 2014 (see above). Local informal rules stipulate that women cannot access family planning without first getting permission from their husbands, and GED doctors are only able to provide three-month contraception, when women bring their husbands. Men sometimes beat their wives for using contraception, NGO workers in the region said. \u201cThis is because women are supposed to take permission from their husbands to get family planning and men don\u2019t want them to. We need awareness to change this,\u201d Leila Karim, the head of the SPLM\/A-North women\u2019s association, said. Condoms are not widely available in the markets, health workers and authorities said, but two women interviewed by Human Rights Watch also reported that they felt ashamed of buying them as, they said, it is widely perceived that only a \u201cbad\u201d woman would need one. \u201cI want family planning. I don\u2019t want to give birth all the time \u2026 (but) condoms are just for women who have affairs with other people,\u201d19-year-old Rania Haidar, already a mother of two, said. A lack of knowledge and understanding about contraception is also a barrier. \u201cWomen are afraid of infertility, that it will be permanent. The other problem is that men are worried about other men, that their wives will go and have sex with other people, especially when he is away,\u201d Umjuma Al Sheikh, one of the midwives working at the Loweri hospital said. None of the women Human Rights Watch interviewed were currently using or had access to contraception where they lived and only one woman had accessed the GED hospital in Loweri, a day\u2019s walk away for her. None of the other women knew that family planning was available there. Twelve of the 25 women interviewed did not know what a condom was and another three knew what they were but had never seen one. \u201cThere is no way to control, no choice, you just have babies,\u201d Afaf Saeed said. Magda Dorjwaat, also interviewed in the same displaced community, echoed her: \u201cThere is no way to control births, you just have to give birth.\u201d Most had given up on trying to control pregnancy but two of the women interviewed were using the \u201ccalendar\u201d method. A few women said that they were uninterested personally in using contraception because they felt they needed to, as one woman put it \u201creplace the people lost in the war.\u201d But all saw the advantages of having family planning available. \u201cWomen want fewer children now, four is ideal so that you can feed and educate them,\u201d a former worker at an NGO, said. Fatima Abdelrahman, a 27-year-old woman displaced after government forces attacked and mostly destroyed her village, and struggling to feed her children, said: Our clinic was looted and destroyed. In Kau there is a clinic, but it is one hour walking from here. But even before they were destroyed there are no condoms here, no family planning. Almost every year I give birth, it would be better if I could space it, it\u2019s tiresome trying to feed all my children already. More widely available contraception, together with comprehensive sexuality education, could also help prevent early pregnancy leading to marriage or a loss of education for girls and young women. Women interviewed in December 2016 said that, even though they were already married, they could perhaps complete more of their education if they could space pregnancies. \u201cI would like family planning. I dropped out from school, I would like it so I could go back,\u201d Samia Ramadan, 20 years old and a pregnant mother of two, said sadly. Knowledge of family planning methods was low, and some interviewees did not know that it is possible to space births. Difficulties Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections The lack of condoms has made fighting sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as syphilis and gonorrhea, more difficult in Nuba. Local authorities have distributed some condoms as protection for both women and men against transmission of some STIs, including HIV, but even at the time of the distribution, supplies were limited. \u201cWe gather people and do awareness on HIV. But [because there are so few condoms] all we can recommend is abstinence and monogamy,\u201d the rebel secretariat of health head, Tutu Mustapha Turkash, said. Testing for HIV is available in a few locations but only one place, the Mother of Mercy Hospital, can check white blood cell counts and then provide antiretroviral medicines in the right doses. The number of syphilis and gonorrhea cases have increased in recent years, according to all the medical and NGO officials interviewed for this report.No information is available about the overall incidence of the diseases, but, for example, the Mother of Mercy Hospital and clinics saw 64 cases in 2012, 74 in 2013, 107 in 2014, 142 in 2015 and 178 in 2016. Gonorrhea cases also increased, even more sharply, from 39 in 2013, 139 in 2014, 296 cases in 2015 and 896 cases in 2016. A health worker at the GED Loweri hospital said that they had seen an increase in both diseases in 2016 compared to the year before, and that they regularly treat newborns with congenital syphilis and conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea. In the 40 clinics supported by a local NGO, 3,199 cases of STIs were reported in 2014 and 3,462 cases in 2015. Health officials said they saw a much lower number of cases before 2014. Since none of these clinics have labs, these numbers of syphilis and gonorrhea cases, and patients\u2019 treatment, are based on symptoms alone. In a small town, Hadara, the local nurse said that he sees about two cases a week of suspected gonorrhea or suspected syphilis, and that last year there were more cases for these two diseases than anything else except for malaria.\nIV. National and International Legal Obligations At all times during the conflicts in Sudan, both international human rights law as well as international humanitarian law \u2013 as a lex specialis - apply. In this context, Sudan is a party to both the International Covenants \u2013 the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \u2013 as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and is a party to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols I and II. Nevertheless, civilians living in rebel-held parts of Nuba mountains have not had access to adequate life-saving humanitarian supplies since the conflict began 6 years ago. The Sudanese government\u2019s obstruction of humanitarian access flouts its obligations under both national and international law. The SPLM\/A-North\u2019s rejection of impartial humanitarian assistance also contravenes its obligations as a party to the conflict. Obligations to Allow Unhindered Humanitarian Aid The conflicts between the government and rebel forces in South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur are non-international armed conflicts under international law, and governed by the body of international humanitarian law applicable to internal conflicts. Sudan is a party to Additional Protocol II, relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflict, and is also bound by customary international humanitarian law. Under international humanitarian law, a civilian population suffering undue hardship is entitled to receive impartial humanitar\n}}

{{When a medical organization considers hiring a new employee, the most important factors are? Well, at PRIMACORE Solutions we ask ourselves this question each time we are getting ready to add someone to our Team. Based on our 30 years of experience in the staffing industry, here are five (5) attributes we look for in the right candidate:\n1.) Team Player: In healthcare organizations, services are delivered by a multidisciplinary team, where everyone plays a complementary role. The ideal candidate will understand how his or her role fits in with the entire team.\n2.) Training & Education: From PA\u2019s to Nurses to CNAs, a healthcare employee is expected to have completed a specific educational program and built a solid core of job-related hands on skills.\n3.) Experience: A candidate who is already working the healthcare field is likely to have an edge over a newcomer, all other qualities being equal. The reason for this is typically that it takes less time to orient and experienced candidate to the specific requirements of the job.\n4.) Attitude: For most of us in Hiring positions, attitude is perhaps even more important than education, training and experience. Is the candidate an upbeat, positive and friendly person filled with energy who will be a real asset to the organization? Or is the applicant a pessimist who would like to coast through the day?\n5.) Compliance: Healthcare employees must meet and demonstrate compliance with specific standards. At PRIMACORE Solutions we carefully screen candidates to assure they hold appropriate, up-to-date credentials, if necessary we provide additional training, on specific topics in the healthcare setting.\nIf you are a candidate seeking a position in in the healthcare setting, this list can provide a benchmark for measuring how close you are to being the ideal candidate.\nFor more information visit us at: http:\/\/prima-core.com\/\n}}

{{WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned House Republican lawmakers that he will leave Obamacare in place and move on to tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on Friday.\nIt was not clear late on Thursday evening that Trump and the Republican leaders who crafted the bill had enough support to pass it, meaning they now risk defeat in their first attempt at major legislation and may fail to deliver on a key campaign pledge.\n\u201cWe have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it\u2019s collapsing and it\u2019s failing families, and tomorrow we\u2019re proceeding,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after an evening all-hands meeting. He ignored reporters who asked if he had secured the votes to pass the bill.\nRyan and leaders in the House of Representatives were forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, earlier on Thursday, dealing Trump an embarrassing setback.\nThe vote had been symbolically planned for the anniversary of former Democratic President Barack Obama signing his namesake healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, in 2010. It was supposed to have been Trump\u2019s first legislative victory.\nTrump and his fellow Republicans had pledged to replace Obamacare, which they view as too intrusive and too expensive.\nBut, after a week of calling Republican lawmakers and bringing them into the Oval Office for meetings, Trump failed to close the deal with two different factions within his party on time for the planned Thursday vote.\nConservatives felt the bill did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare and moderates felt the plan could hurt their constituents. House Republican leaders had signaled they were ready to work through the weekend to figure out a way to reconcile their differences.\nAs the healthcare drama unfolded on Capitol Hill, Trump played it cool, taking a break from negotiations to hang out with some truckers, climbing into the cab of a long-haul transport truck parked on the back driveway of the White House, and blowing the horn a few times.\nHe told reporters the vote would be close but he remained optimistic. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing well. We\u2019ll find out in about three hours,\u201d he said, just as reports began to surface that the vote had been postponed.\nBy evening, Trump sent his top lieutenants to a dramatic meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday night with an ultimatum: he was done talking. According to Representative Chris Collins of New York, a top Trump ally, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told House Republicans that Trump wanted a vote.\n\u201cThe president has said he wants a vote tomorrow, up or down,\u201d Collins said.\n\u201cIf for any reason it is down, we are just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda\u201d such as tax reform, Collins told reporters after leaving the meeting.\nHowever, the vote has been seen by financial markets as a crucial test of Trump\u2019s ability to work with Congress to deliver on his other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\nEven if their replacement plan does eventually get approval from the House, the legislation faces a potentially tough fight in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nThe House and Senate had hoped to deliver a new healthcare bill to Trump by April 8, when Congress is scheduled to begin a two-week spring break.\nGETTING TO YES?\nThe Republicans have a majority in the House but, because of united Democratic opposition, can afford to lose only 21 Republican votes. By Thursday morning, NBC News said that 30 Republicans had planned to vote \u201cno\u201d or were leaning that way.\nNorth Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, the chairman of the pivotal conservative bloc known as the Freedom Caucus, said he and others were struggling to support the plan.\n\u201cI am desperately trying to get to \u2018yes\u2019 and I think the president knows that. I told him that personally,\u201d Meadows said. However, after Thursday night\u2019s meeting, he was still a \u2018no\u2019.\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan and Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney arrive for a meeting about the American Health Care Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 23, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\nObamacare aimed to boost the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Some 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.\nThe House replacement plan would rescind the taxes created by Obamacare, repeal a penalty against people who do not buy coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, and modify tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans.\nHouse leaders agreed to four pages of last-minute amendments to the bill, including allowing states to choose which \u201cessential benefits\u201d are required in healthcare insurance plans, and keeping a 0.9 percent surcharge on Medicare for high-income Americans for six years. It was unclear whether that was enough.\nRepresentative Trent Franks, a Freedom Caucus member who had been \u201cundeclared\u201d on his position on the bill, said he liked the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d Franks said outside the House.\nThe amendments will give states more money for maternal health and mental health, said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska moderate who still has not said how he will vote.\nMARKETS WATCHING CLOSELY\nUncertainty over the healthcare bill rattled financial markets this week. The delay in the house vote is likely to extend the ups and downs in the stocks of some hospital groups and health insurers.\nU.S. stock markets rose steadily in recent months on optimism over a pro-business Trump agenda but fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that failure to push through the healthcare bill could postpone other business-friendly Trump priorities.\n\u201cDelay on healthcare equates to delay on tax cuts. That is why the market turned red when the news flow suggested they didn\u2019t have a deal,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, a money management firm.\nOthers said it was too soon to panic.\n\u201cIf this thing gets materially delayed or if we get a \u2018no\u2019 vote, we\u2019re going to see a horrific market reaction. But if they vote in the morning and it passes, we\u2019ll have a hell of a rally,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nSlideshow (16 Images)\nGraphic on Obamacare and Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs\/2n0ZMKf)\nGraphic on shifting positions in the U.S. Senate on Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs\/2mUE4Xf)\nGraphic on poll on Americans' views of the Republican healthcare bill ( tmsnrt.rs\/2n7f3e4)\n}}

If you stick around, I will announce my decision with you.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s appearance on the program, his fourth,was billed as a chance for him to boost enrollment in health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. To that purpose, he encouraged moms in the audience to call their children and tell them to get covered.\n\u201cNo matter how old we get, we still listen to our moms,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt sounds corny, but it\u2019s true \u2026 Moms have great influence. Call your sons and daughters. Tell them to sign up.\u201d\nHealth and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius said she\u2019d like to see at least 7 million people enrolled in health care programs through the exchanges by the end of open enrollment on 31 March. By the end of January, 3.3 million people had signed up.\nBut the most probing questions to come from The View co-hosts focused on Biden\u2019s designs on a job promotion.\n\u201cLet me try coming in backwards,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIf Hillary does not run, will you?\u201d\n\u201cWhether she runs or not does not affect my decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEverything I would have to do to be a viable candidate is the same thing I\u2019d have to do to be the best vice-president possible.\u201d\nBiden said his foreign policy experience \u201cuniquely\u201d qualified him to carry out President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda \u2013 neglecting to note that his prospective opponent, Clinton, most recently held the job of secretary of state.\n\u201cI think my knowledge of foreign policy, my engagement with world leaders, uniquely positions me to follow through on the agenda Barack and I have\u201d begun, Biden said.\nAnd Biden responded to a question from Jenny McCarthy about his legacy as vice-president with a specificity that would have not sounded out of place in a stump speech.\n\u201cHe\u2019s given me major assignments, carte blanche to take whatever assignment I want and do it my way,\u201d Biden said of the president. He said Obama had personally bypassed proposals by Clinton and former defense secretary Robert Gates to put him, Biden, in charge of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. He said he also ran the first-term stimulus program.\nOn Monday night Biden appeared on Late Night with its new host, comedian Seth Meyers, and joked with fellow guest Amy Poehler about the 2016 presidential contest.\nThe View, ABC\u2019s daytime talk show, had almost 3m total viewers a week in November, when it hit an eight-month high in attracting women ages 18-49, the Wrap reported.\n}}

{{(Reuters) - More than half of all states have launched lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the healthcare reforms championed by President Barack Obama, leading a judge to strike down the landmark law on Monday.\nIn a lawsuit filed by 26 states and led by Florida, Judge Roger Vinson said the requirement that individuals buy health insurance is unconstitutional. The federal government considers the requirement critical to implementing the reforms.\nMost legal scholars expect one of the suits to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Individuals, advocacy groups and hospitals have also sued.\nHere are details of the current state of legal challenges to the law:\nRECENT DECISIONS\n* A U.S. federal judge in Florida said Congress exceeded its authority in requiring Americans to buy health insurance and imposed an injunction against the law. Judge Roger Vinson said the entire law \u201cmust be declared void\u201d because the requirement is inextricably linked to other parts of law. The federal government is expected to appeal the decision, and will likely seek a stay of the ruling pending review of the appeal.\n* A U.S. appeals court last week agreed to expedite consideration of challenges to a ruling last month by U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson that the federal government could not compel a person to buy health insurance. The court set oral arguments to be held between May 10-13. The U.S. government has appealed and, in a twist, so has the state of Virginia, which filed the suit. The state said the judge erred by not throwing out the entire law. Hudson said the penalty charged for not having health insurance is not a tax, shooting down the federal government\u2019s argument that it is empowered to levy taxes.\n* A U.S. District Court in New Jersey dismissed on December 9 a lawsuit filed by a cardiologist, a patient and a physicians\u2019 advocacy organization that had alleged the law violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, which allows the federal government to regulate commerce among the states, and also violated the Fifth Amendment.\nOTHER RULINGS\n* Another appeal, in a lawsuit filed by Liberty University, the college founded by conservative evangelical leader Jerry Falwell, has also been expedited and will be heard by the Fourth Circuit court in May. In November, a federal judge ruled the individual mandate and a requirement some employers buy coverage for employees was legal under the Commerce Clause. The judge also said the law did not illegally permit federal funding for abortion.\n* In October, another federal judge partly dismissed a suit filed in Michigan by the Thomas More Law Center, ruling Congress had the authority to enact the law under the Commerce Clause.\n* A California court dismissed a lawsuit, now under appeal at the Ninth Circuit Court, that said the healthcare law violates individual rights, increases taxes and violates physician-patient privileges, along with violating the Commerce Clause.\n* In November, U.S. District Court Judge David Dowd partially denied and partially granted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Citizen\u2019s Association in Ohio. While he dismissed arguments that the law violates freedom of association, due process and privacy protections, Dowd is considering arguments that the law exceeds federal authority granted by the Commerce Clause.\n* At least 24 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts by states and private parties.\nWHAT IS AT ISSUE?\n* States like Virginia have passed, or are considering, legislation declaring the healthcare law cannot be enforced in their states. State legislators in Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Texas and Wyoming have introduced bills that establish penalties, including fines and jail time, for any agent seeking to enforce the healthcare law within their states\u2019 borders.\n* The states\u2019 main concern is that the law permits the federal government to force people to buy things, in this case requiring that all Americans purchase health insurance or pay a penalty under the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The federal government counters that everyone will inevitably pay for healthcare, whether through insurance or during an emergency, and that without the individual mandate, premiums will rise.\n* If the courts decide the individual mandate is unconstitutional, it is unclear if the mandate can be cut away from the law while leaving the other requirements intact. The states say that without the individual mandate the law is rendered toothless.\n* Parts of the U.S. Constitution that have come into play are the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause, which makes federal power supreme to states\u2019 power, and the 10th Amendment, which leaves to states all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government.\n* Some of the suits also focus on whether abortions are funded with taxpayer dollars under the law.\n* When Obama lobbied for the bill, he said there would not be a new tax associated with the individual mandate requiring coverage. The penalty for not having health insurance, though, is collected through tax filings and the federal government argues the fine is indeed a tax it is empowered to levy. States say the U.S. government does not have the authority to charge the fine and point to the discrepancy between Obama\u2019s statements and the U.S. government\u2019s arguments.\nSources: Court documents, Pacific Legal Foundation\n}}

{{At least one Republican senator predicted a consensus was still \u2018several more weeks away\u2019, and few senators have been willing to defend the bill publicly\nRepublican senators left Washington more than a week ago without voting on a long-promised repeal of the Affordable Care Act or their unpopular plan to replace it. The GOP lawmakers return on Monday with the daunting task of crafting a bill still very much in front of them, amid swirling doubts about the prospect of finding a solution any time soon.\n\u201cMy view is it\u2019s probably going to be dead,\u201d Arizona senator John McCain told CBS on Sunday. \u201cI fear that it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\nMcConnell hints healthcare vote could fall short: 'I'm a guy with a Rubik's cube' Read more\nA vote is unlikely to take place this week, with at least one Republican senator predicting that his colleagues are still \u201cseveral more weeks away\u201d from reaching a consensus on a healthcare replacement. Last week at a town hall, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell compared the process of negotiating healthcare reform with intransigent Republican senators to solving a Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the position of a guy with a Rubik\u2019s cube, trying to twist the dial in such a way to get at least 50 members of my conference who can agree to a version of repealing and replacing Obamacare,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThat is a very timely subject that I\u2019m grappling with as we speak.\u201d\nRepublicans were not meant to still be grappling with healthcare over the Fourth of July recess. When Trump took office and the GOP kept control of Congress, they laid out an ambitious agenda that included repealing Obamacare as early as January and then moving on to tax reform and infrastructure.\nBut intransigent Republican opposition \u2013 and a groundswell of political activism in the wake of Trump\u2019s election \u2013 derailed that timeline. Now it\u2019s summer and with only a handful of working weeks left before the August recess, the Senate Republican leadership is still searching furiously for 50 votes, a tally that would only push them over the finish line with a casting vote from the vicepresident, Mike Pence.\nThe clearest sign of Republican resistance to the bill was how few senators were willing to defend the bill publicly. During the Fourth of July recess politicians typically relish the opportunity to march in patriotic parades and clasp hands with constituents. But this year those appearances were scarce.\nAnd the few Republican senators who made public appearances were met with protests and pleas from constituents concerned about the Republican healthcare plan.\nSusan Collins. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite\/AP\nAt a parade in Eastport, Maine, Susan Collins, whose opposition to an initial draft of the healthcare law helped delay the vote, said her constituents were singularly focused on healthcare.\n\u201cThere was only one issue. That\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s usually a wide range of issues,\u201d Collins told the Washington Post. \u201cI heard, over and over again, encouragement for my stand against the current version of the Senate and House healthcare bills. People were thanking me, over and over again. \u2018Thank you, Susan!\u2019 \u2018Stay strong, Susan!\u2019\u201d\nWhere a Republican senator refused to hold a town hall, voters made their views known. Tens of thousands of liberal activists and concerned constituents turned out for dozens of rallies across the country to urge their senators to \u201cvote no\u201d on the healthcare bill. Some groups organized protests and staged sit-ins at senators\u2019 offices, and in Columbus, Rob Portman\u2019s constituents held a cookout.\nAs initially drafted, the Republican healthcare plan would repeal major pieces of the ACA, including the mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or face a penalty. It would also make deep cuts to Medicaid, a joint state-federal public health program for low-income Americans, compared with spending under the current law.\nAn analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that 22 million people would lose healthcare over the next decade under the Republican healthcare plan. In a new report that assessed the plan\u2019s impact over two decades, the agency estimated that spending on Medicaid under the replacement plan would be 35% lower by 2036 than under current law.\nMcConnell has introduced a number of changes, including adding $45bn to combat the opioid epidemic. Also under consideration is a compromise amendment by Ted Cruz, the conservative Texas senator who opposed the bill because it did not go far enough in repealing Obamacare.\nUnder the Cruz proposal, insurance companies could sell non-ACA-compliant healthcare plans as long as they also offered at least one that met the law\u2019s mandates, including coverage for maternity care, mental health treatment and prescription drugs. Though the proposal is gaining traction among conservatives, healthcare experts on both sides of the political debate believe the measure would likely result in prohibitively high costs for comprehensive plans, which sicker Americans would need.\nActivists cry cowardice as Republican senators shut doors to healthcare town halls Read more\nMcConnell sent an updated version, including the Cruz amendment, of the healthcare plan to the agency, and a new report is expected this week. The CBO is expected to release another analysis sometime next week, a likely indicator that Senate Republicans will not vote on the plan until later this month.\n\u201cI think we are making steady progress,\u201d Cruz told ABC on Sunday. \u201cThe conversations have been collaborative and in good faith.\u201d\nIf Republicans fail to reach an agreement on a replacement plan, McConnell said he would work with Democrats to stabilize the insurance markets.\n\u201cNo action is not an alternative,\u201d McConnell told constituents at a Rotary Club lunch on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.\u201d\nBut Cruz said he agreed with a proposal by Trump \u2013 seen as unhelpful and unrealistic by many Republicans \u2013 that the GOP should try to repeal Obamacare without agreeing a replacement if the Senate bill fails.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get this done right now, I agree with the president, then let\u2019s honor the promise on repeal and spend more time to get it done,\u201d Cruz said on Sunday.\n\u201cI believe we can get it done.\u201d\nSign up for the Minute email.

{{New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo defends New Yorkers\u2019 access to healthcare in the wake of Republicans' attempt to repeal Obamacare. (Reuters)\nGov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday made a move to defend New York residents\u2019 access to affordable healthcare in the wake of the Republicans' American Health Care Act \u2014 and to bar any insurance company from future participation in programs like Medicaid if they withdraw from the state health exchange.\n\"We will not stand idly by as ultra-conservatives in Washington try to roll back the progress we have made to expand access to quality, affordable healthcare, putting our most vulnerable New Yorkers at risk,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cAs long as I am governor, New Yorkers will not be subject to price discrimination based on age, gender or pre-existing conditions, and essential health benefits will continue to be the rule, not the exception.\u201d\nUnder the Obamacare-repealing AHCA, at least 23 million Americans would lose access to healthcare and be charged more if they have pre-existing conditions, which some insurers previously identified as things like domestic violence, sexual assault, acne or a Caesarean section.\nWhile the AHCA passed the House early last month after being revamped from its first inception in March, it still needs to pass the Senate. According to a May 25 Quinnipiac University Poll, only 20 percent of American voters support the Republicans' healthcare plan.\n\u201cThese aggressive actions will make certain that no matter what happens in Congress, the people of New York will not have to worry about losing access to the quality medical care they need and deserve,\u201d Cuomo said.\nSo what exactly is Cuomo promising with his aggressive approach to New York healthcare?\nThe governor directed the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services (DFS) to continue the 10 protections mandated by Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act, and made it a license requirement for insurers in New York.\nThose protections include ambulatory patient services like office visits, chemo and radiology services, emergency and urgent-care services, hospitalization and hospice care, maternity, mental health and substance-abuse care, prescription coverage, rehabilitation services and devices, lab service and testing, preventive wellness such as gynecological exams, well-child visits and prostate cancer screenings and pediatric service.\nUnder existing state law, DFS will also dictate that healthcare providers offer coverage for contraceptive drugs and devices without co-pay, coinsurance or deductible, regardless of what happens to Obamacare, which currently remains in effect. Additionally, DFS will mandate that insurers offer coverage for medically necessary abortion services without co-pays, coinsurance or deductibles.\nCuomo also directed the Department of Health to bar any insurer who stops offering Qualified Health Plans on the state marketplace from future participation in programs that coincide with it, such as Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential Plan.\nCuomo\u2019s announcement was met with mixed reactions on Twitter, with one responder saying \u201cthank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d while another said they were \u201ctaking steps to leave this state.\u201d\n\u201cHealthcare is not a right when \u2026 some drink alcohol and eat McDonald\u2019s,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t care about themselves, why should I?\u201d\nSeveral also called for the governor to create a single-payer plan.\n}}

{{Fewer than one in six (4\/30) healthcare workers (HCW) followed all CDC recommendations for the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) after patient care, according to a brief report published in the July issue of the American Journal of Infection Control, the official publication of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC).\nIn this study undertaken by researchers from the University of Wisconsin, a trained observer watched healthcare personnel entering and exiting patient rooms specified as following isolation precautions on various units of the hospital. Isolation precautions are used to help stop the spread of germs from one person to another and may require use of gowns, gloves, and face protection. Observations took place October 13-31, 2014.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that gloves should be removed first, followed by the gentle removal of the gown from the back while still in the patient's isolation room. Of the thirty HCWs observed removing PPE, seventeen removed the gown out of order, sixteen wore their PPE out into the hallway, and fifteen removed their gown in a manner that was not gentle, which could cause pathogens from the gown to transfer to their clothes.\n\"As a result of the current Ebola outbreak, the critical issue of proper PPE removal has come front and center,\" the authors state. \"Healthcare facilities should use this opportunity of heightened interest to undertake practice improvement focused on PPE removal protocol, including technique, for all healthcare-associated conditions that require the donning and doffing of PPE.\"\n}}

{{By Reuters\nThe Emirates Investment Authority (EIA), the UAE's only federal sovereign wealth fund, plans to shift the focus of future investments from telecoms into financial services, healthcare and education, its treasury director said.\nSet up in 2007, the EIA manages the federal government's stakes in a number of key firms including United Arab Emirates' telecom operators Etisalat and du.\nPaul Oliver also said the EIA - which has kept a lower profile than peers like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), among the world's largest sovereign wealth funds - may issue bonds in the future with any move linked to an investment.\nThe fund would also be interested in food processing investments, Oliver added.\n\"The sectors that we're very interested in are financial services,\" Oliver told reporters on the sidelines of a loans conference in Dubai.\n\"We're interested in creating a financial services hub in the UAE, and clearly healthcare, education, food in the broader sense like processing.\"\nWhen asked whether the EIA is looking at any particular assets in Dubai, Oliver declined to comment.\nDubai, which is struggling to emerge from a debt crisis, has said it will sell assets as part of a $26 billion restructuring deal for debt-laden conglomerate Dubai World.\nOn Monday, Dubai's government took control of troubled Islamic lender Dubai Bank to prevent a collapse undermining the Gulf Arab state's banking sector. EIA invests in a variety of asset classes, including fixed income, private equity funds, and local equity markets.\nOliver said the fund would try to help develop the financial infrastructure within the UAE towards creation of a local debt market. He said the EIA could be an eventual issuer of bonds itself.\n\"If we do see an opportunity to issue it would be linked with investment opportunities. But to do something like a bond issue means getting a rating - we're a long way from going down that track,\" Oliver said.\n\"In terms of our own funding plans, they will develop over time.\"\nThe EIA also has stakes in Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank and United Arab Shipping Company, according to its website.\n}}

{{LEGACYPHOTO.jpg\nLegacy's Research Institute, at 1225 N. E. Second Ave., is the proposed site for a new psychiatric emergency department in Portland.\n(Maxine Bernstein\/The Oregonian)\nFour major healthcare providers have signed a letter of intent to open a psychiatric emergency department in Legacy's Northeast Portland building and call it the \"Unity Center for Behavioral Health.''\nThe center would provide immediate care to people suffering mental health crises and would respond to the needs identified by U.S. Department of Justice officials, said Legacy Health's behavioral health director Dr. Chris Farentinos. It would accept walk-in patients and patients arriving by ambulance.\nLegacy Health, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente and Oregon Health Science University have agreed to move their psychiatric inpatient services to the new center at Legacy's Holladay Park campus. The next step will be developing a joint operating agreement detailing the management and operations of the center.\nLegacy will pay for remodeling the building, and the other providers will contribute money to operate the center, said Brian Terrett, Legacy Health spokesman. The plan is to have it open late next year.\nThe remodeling cost is estimated at $45 million. Legacy Health has committed $10 million in real estate value and raised another $21 million in private donations. The $14 million balance must be raised through the community, private foundations and government agencies.\nGov. John Kitzhaber has set aside $1 million in the Oregon Health Authority's budget toward the department's psychiatric care.\nWhile it's not exactly what the Justice Department and Portland police had envisioned, the center addresses a gap in care that now has police serving as first-responders and transporting people in deep psychiatric crisis in the back of their patrol cars, Farentinos has said.\nPortland Mayor Charlie Hales praised the latest development.\n\"This is a great first step,'' Hales said. \"The timing of this letter of intent couldn't be better: It's the first week of the 2015 legislative session, and all of these health-care providers are stepping up and joining the call to open such a facility. We are looking forward to working with everyone - the Legislature, the county, the hospitals, the CCOs (coordinated care organizations) and other law-enforcement agencies - to provide a level of parity for our residents who are in mental health crises.\"\nThe site is now home to the Legacy Research Institute's labs and state hospital beds. The research institute will move into a building under construction next door, and the state hospital is moving its beds out by May.\nThe new department would help alleviate the crowding in regional emergency rooms, advocates said.\nIn the last year, nearly 10,000 patient visits to Legacy Health hospital emergency departments were for behavioral health issues. Every day, the emergency departments hold 10 to 20 patients waiting for psychiatric beds, and the patients end up waiting hours to get psychiatric care, according to Farentinos.\nShe said the average length of stay now for psychiatric patients in the regular emergency departments is 16 hours, compared with two hours for those suffering physical ailments.\nThe new psychiatric ER will allow police to call an ambulance and allow emergency medics to assess a person's needs and take the person directly to the center. There, the patients will be treated immediately in a more humane, open living room-type setting by psychiatric experts, Farentinos said.\nThe center will have inpatient beds for 79 adults and 22 adolescent patients.\nIt's modeled after a facility in Alameda, California. In Alameda County, 75 percent of the patients who arrive stay less than 23 hours, while the other 25 percent are admitted to in-patient care that can last as long as eight days.\nWhether Legacy could bill Medicaid for the crisis stabilization care will play a big role in whether the planned psychiatric ER becomes a reality, health care officials said.\nThe Alameda model is feasible in California because of a Medicaid code for crisis stabilization that reimburses the facility on an hourly basis, from a minimum of two hours to a maximum of 20 hours.\nLegacy studied the model and concluded that a reimbursement rate of $100 an hour would make the psychiatric ER in Portland sustainable. Alameda County's hospital receives $109 an hour.\n--Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212; @maxoregonian\n}}

{{The healthcare worker who is the third person to be diagnosed with monkeypox in England reportedly blames the NHS-provided gloves she wore while changing another monkeypox patient\u2019s bedsheets.\nShe also believes she may have passed the virus onto her husband after he woke up with spots covering his entire face.\nThe mother-of-two, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, it thought to have caught monkeypox while treating a patient at Blackpool Victoria Hospital earlier this month, before they were known to be carrying the infection, Public Health England (PHE) said.\nMonkeypox, is an infection similar to smallpox, with several cases diagnosed in Nigeria (Picture: Getty)\nAccording to The Sun, the 40-year-old woman \u2013 who has not been named \u2013 blamed \u2018pathetically small\u2019 hospital-provided gloves that did not cover her arms as she changed the patient\u2019s bedding.\nThe healthcare assistant developed flu-like symptoms after working at the hospital.\nHero imam 'spat at' by cyclist on way home from mosque event to promote unity\nShe believes her 50-year-old husband is also a victim after he developed spots on his face \u2013 one of the symptoms of the virus.\n\u2018The gloves were too short to cover my arms and left my skin exposed while changing the bed. I think that\u2019s how I got infected,\u2019 she told The Sun.\n\u2018They told us we weren\u2019t at risk \u2014 but that\u2019s obviously nonsense. I\u2019m terrified about what may happen to me and my family.\u2019\nSymptoms of monkeypox \u2014 which is similar to smallpox in humans \u2014 include scabbing, fever, headache, muscle aches and chills.\nThe healthcare worker reportedly believes she caught the virus changing the bedsheets of another monkeypox victim (Picture: Getty)\nA common symptom of monkeypox is the appearance of spots or scabs on the skin (Picture: Getty)\nThere was a large outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and sporadic cases have been reported since.\nAlthough the hospital worker is the third person to be diagnosed with the virus in the UK, she is believed to be the first to be infected in the country.\nThe first person \u2013 a resident of Nigeria staying at a naval base in Cornwall \u2013 was diagnosed recently.\nThe second case of the rare infection recorded in the UK \u2013 the woman\u2019s patient \u2013 is believed to have contracted the virus after travelling to Nigeria.\nOn Wednesday night, the heathcare worker was believed to have been placed in a specialist unit at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Victoria Infirmary, where she was taken by emergency staff wearing biohazard gear a day before.\nOfficials at Public Health England had insisted the risk of infection was low and that there was \u2018no risk to other staff, patients or visitors\u2019.\nMonkeypox: How it spreads to humans The Monkeypox virus does not spread easily between people but may have serious consequences (Picture: Getty) Monkeypox does not spread easily between people and most who contract the infection recover within a few weeks, although severe illness can occur in some people. First infection results from direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals. In Africa human infections have been documented through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels, with rodents being the most likely carriers of the virus. Eating inadequately cooked meat of infected animals is also a possible risk factor. Secondary, or human-to-human, transmission can result from close contact with infected respiratory tract secretions, skin lesions of an infected person or objects recently contaminated by patient fluids or lesion materials. Transmission occurs primarily via droplet respiratory particles usually requiring prolonged face-to-face contact, which puts household members of active cases at greater risk of infection. Transmission can also occur by inoculation or via the placenta (congenital monkeypox). There is no evidence, to date, that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox infections in the human population.\nPHE previously said there was \u2018no UK link\u2019 between the first two patients.\nBut Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said the third case is \u2018not wholly unexpected\u2019.\nDr Phin said: \u2018This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made.\n\u2018We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly.\n\u2018It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified.\n\u2018This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced.\u2019\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?

{{Sometimes called the Woodstock or the Super Bowl of biotech, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is where companies, researchers, investors come to talk about the most exciting new developments in health and medicine. In today's episode of Industry Focus: Healthcare, Kristine Harjes interviews CEOs from three companies at the conference.\nAlnylam's (NASDAQ:ALNY) Barry Greene talks about patisiran and RNAi and what this drug can mean for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis patients. Arena Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:ARNA) Amit Munshi explains how the company is moving past its Belviq mishap, and the exciting new drugs it's developing today. Jeff Marrazzo from Spark Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ONCE) talks about what its gene therapy approval meant for the company and for healthcare as a whole, as well as some promising new research Spark is doing in hemophilia treatment.\nA full transcript follows the video.\nThis video was recorded on Jan. 10, 2018.\nKristine Harjes: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Wednesday, January 10th. I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and I'm reporting from San Francisco this week from the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, colloquially known as either the Super Bowl of biotech or the Woodstock of biotech, depending on which high school stereotype you were. You might think there would be a heck of a lot more hippie types here in SF, but after attending an event two nights ago called Burgers and Beers, in which about 200 men and 10 women packed into a single bar to watch football, I'm really not so sure. Anyway, today's episode is going to feature clips from interviews with various CEOs of biotechs that presented at the conference. The first interview you'll hear is with Barry Greene, the CEO of Alnylam.\nBarry, thank you so much for joining me!\nBarry Greene: Kristine, thanks so much for having us!\nHarjes: I would love to set the stage for our chat by discussing first a little bit about the scientific platform that you guys are working with, which is RNAi. Can you give us a little bit of background on what that is and how it works?\nGreene: Absolutely. Alnylam, which is now 15 years old and on the cusp of becoming a commercial stage company, was actually found it on this breakthrough discovery in biology called RNA interference, which is a natural process in all of our cells that manipulates the genome. What does that mean in plain English? Today's drug works by binding to protein and stopping protein action. We stop the protein from being made in the first place. If you had a leaky faucet in your kitchen, today's drug works by mopping up the floor, we shut off the spigot. And we can leverage RNA interference to create an entirely new class of innovative medicines.\nHarjes: That's awesome. How does this differ from something like antisense?\nGreene: Both RNAi and antisense target the message. DNA makes RNA, which encodes protein, and both work by cleaving message and stopping protein from being made in the first place, shutting off the spigot, as I said before. RNAi, though, is a natural process that is catalytic. What does that mean? That means, and we're demonstrating this with our drugs today, very small amounts of drug can work for long periods of time.\nHarjes: Very cool. So, you mentioned that this is the year, hopefully, assuming everything goes according to plan, Alnylam will become commercial stage. As you prepare to launch the drug Patisiran later this year, what are the greatest areas of focus, and how are you transitioning to a commercial stage company?\nGreene: We're entirely ready to be a commercial stage company. In fact, when we founded the company 15 years ago, retaining important medicines in major markets, U.S., Western Europe, was always part of our strategy. We're here on purpose, this is not a mistake. We did not by happenstance get into this position. And we've been preparing to be commercial from the very beginning. We filed both the NDA and MAA for Apollo, a really spectacular set of data demonstrating the ability to reverse hereditary ATTR in a majority of patients, data unseen in this patient population up to this point. And with regulatory approval mid-year in the United States and end of year in Europe, we'll be launching Patisiran. What we've been able to do in the meantime is set up our supply chain. It's always important to get drug to patients. And we're really building out our medical affairs, patient access and patient hub capabilities so that the day we get approval, we're ready to ship drug to patients.\nHarjes: For background, can you tell us a little bit about the indication?\nGreene: We've studied Patisiran in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. It's a rare orphan disease that's caused by the misfolding of a very specific protein called transthyretin. This is a protein that's made in the liver, which is where our drug works. And when this protein misfolds, it deposits to peripheral tissues, so, nerves, heart, and gut, creating major dysfunction and major disability in patients that, for the most part, becomes fatal in two to 15 years. By providing Patisiran on an every three-week basis, we've seen significant reduction in the TTR protein, so knockdown of TTR, which in fact has resulted in regrowth of nerves. In fact, a beneficial effect across a wide range of the endpoints of neurological dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction. So, people's stomachs get better, and other autonomic dysfunction gets better as well. It's been pretty remarkable, and very satisfying for this patient population.\nHarjes: That's awesome. Given that it's a very rare disease, how are you thinking about pricing?\nGreene: We, from the beginning, have believed that if we deliver extreme, innovative value to the healthcare system, we should demonstrate and document that value. This is a disease that costs the healthcare system a significant amount of money. People become disabled and therefore can't work. Their caregivers can't hold full-time jobs. They're often hospitalized and consume a significant amount of healthcare dollars from the system. So, by bringing forward innovation, we think we should get paid for it. That being said, we launched patient access principles last year. One of the principles was to provide value-based pricing. So, we'll have orphan like pricing, which are hundreds of thousands of dollars of drug, but our agreement with payers and countries that want to get into these value-based agreements is, we're going to put our money where our mouth is, and structure agreements so that people pay for outcomes.\nHarjes: What does that actually translate to for you guys? Are you offering rebates? What does that look like?\nGreene: We're still working through exactly what the value-based agreements look like, but it can range anything from trying the drug to make sure it works, and you have TTR knockdown, to measuring sets of endpoints out to 12 months, to ensuring that we have the beneficial effects that the overall population has seen on a specific patient by patient basis, and if so we get full payment, and if not, there could be a level of discount or return for that patient going forward.\nHarjes: Very cool. Something that you mentioned in yesterday's presentation that I wanted to dig into a little bit is that you think that many analysts are overestimating the near-term value of Patisiran, and underestimating the long-term value. What do you mean by that, and how can investors act accordingly?\nGreene: Great question. There are different kinds of orphan diseases. Obviously, orphan diseases are rare, and there aren't a big set of numbers. There are some orphan diseases, like cystic fibrosis, for example, that are not hard to diagnose. So, while they're rare diseases, if your son has cystic fibrosis, he can get diagnosed pretty quickly. There's other kinds of orphan diseases, and historically diseases like PNH or HAE have fallen into this category. In our case, hereditary amyloidosis, falls in the case of hard to diagnose disease because it's a multisystemic disease that, frankly, physicians just don't look for. So, while there are a significant number of patients out there, we have to put significant effort in place to find those patients. They're often in the healthcare system, but may have been misdiagnosed with a different kind of neuropathy, a different gastroenterology issue, or even a cardiac issue that's not in fact appropriate. It could be hereditary ATTR. So, what we're doing is disease awareness, physician and patient education, patient finding initiatives. For example, we've put something in place called Alnylam Act, which is free genetic testing for physicians and patients if the physicians suspect the patient might have this mutation of TTR. By providing free genetic testing, we're helping the healthcare system identify patients much more rapidly than they might have on their own.\nSo, that's a long answer. It's going to take significant work to find the patients, get them on drug, and get them on paid drug. A ramp potentially slower than some of the analysts projected. But in the long-term, we have an opportunity for not only hereditary ATTR, but asymptomatic carriers, and in fact, wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, particularly with our next drug, ALN-TTRsc02, where there's hundreds of thousands of patients.\nHarjes: And how far along is that one?\nGreene: We have committed to start a Phase III for ALN-TTRsc02 later this year, and we committed at this conference that we will be developing that broadly for all TTR amyloidosis.\nHarjes: Great. Continuing talking about the pipeline a little bit, I'm always interested in the strategic decisions about trial design. Something that stood out to me was you'll be using a surrogate endpoint for approval for Givosiran in porphyria. What are the risks in using that sort of accelerated pathway?\nGreene: Just to back up on Givosiran. Givosiran is an RNAi therapeutic target at the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria. This is a bunch of orphan diseases that are characterized by extreme abdominal attacks that create a significant amount of other symptomatology, such as psychosomatic issues, and in fact chronic pain and disability between attacks. What we've seen with Givosiran is, we dampen this toxic pathway of ALA and PBG by targeting the top of the pathway. And that has resulted in about 75% lowering of attacks. Really amazing for these patients that have pain and live between attacks. What we've been able to demonstrate this far, and it's really been a remarkable clinical effort, is that by lowering ALA, we demonstrate a lowering of attack rates. So, our Phase III design is in fact set up to show a differential in attacks between placebo and drugs, so we do have that hard and point of attacks. But, what the USFDA has agreed to is an interim analysis where 30 patients have reached three months on urinary ALA only. And we've shown so far that ALA lowers when we treat with Givosiran. So, we feel really good about the surrogate endpoint. But in fact, we will have the complete data trial results showing a difference in attack rates on drug vs. placebo as we market and sell the drug in the U.S. and Europe and the rest of the world.\nHarjes: Great. And how are you thinking about the risks that are associated with taking that pathway?\nGreene: The interim analysis is a pretty good pathway, particularly in the United States, where we've already reached agreement on showing ALA reduction as an accelerated approval, and then we'll submit the full drug, showing a full Phase III trial, showing a reduction in attacks as a full beneficial data set. Outside of the United States, we may, in some countries, in fact wait for the full data set, because you really only have one chance to set pricing. So, that full dataset outside the United States will probably be even more important.\nHarjes: OK, interesting. Before we sign off, I want to give our listeners at taste of the conference itself, since we are here in San Francisco. As a CEO that's presenting and being a part of all of these discussions and meetings day in and day out, I'm sure your schedule has been even more hectic than mine has been. I've pretty much been mainlining caffeine just to keep up. [laughs] Yeah, I can see your coffee mug, you've been doing the same thing. But, every year, this conference draws more and more people. I think it has something like 10,000 attendees this year. What makes it so special?\nGreene: J.P. Morgan, and frankly, H&Q, for those of us who were around back then and remember it, it was really the healthcare kickoff meeting of the year. I see more people that work down the street in Cambridge out here than I do in Cambridge. It really is the center of the universe this week when it comes to healthcare. Everybody's here. And everybody's grateful for J.P. Morgan for hosting the week, but frankly, every bank and every analyst and every investor is out here, so it's a really efficient way of meeting hundreds of people, in one location, one spot. And there's always a great buzz around J.P. Morgan.\nHarjes: There certainly is. Well, thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy schedule to meet with me today.\nGreene: Thanks for having us! I appreciate it.\nHarjes: Next up, I sat down with the new-ish CEO of Arena Pharmaceuticals. You may remember the name as the maker of Belviq, an obesity drug that commercialized, quite frankly, terribly, leaving the stock in the dust. The company abandoned the drug and replaced its management team. The Arena of today bears little resemblance to the Arena of a few years ago. Here's my conversation with CEO Amit Munshi.\nWe're here today at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference with the CEO of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Amit Munshi. Amit, welcome! Thank you for joining me today!\nAmit Munshi: Great, thank you!\nHarjes: Many of our listeners know Arena from the Belviq days. Can you talk about that turn around a little bit? What happened with Belviq, and where is the company at today?\nMunshi: Absolutely. This management team joined about 18 months ago. We were brought in by the board to essentially hit the reset button on the company. Belviq was, of course, approved by the FDA, it was commercialized by our partner, Eisai Pharmaceuticals, but commercially did not have the success that was originally anticipated. The board still believed there was tremendous value in the company, and so did we, as the management team coming in. And the fundamental thesis is quite simple. While Belviq was the focus of the company going forward, historically, the company raised a tremendous mother Capital, they never turned the spigot off on the research efforts inside the company. At one point, they had 300 research scientists developing a basket really, really exciting compounds. So, our fundamental thesis was, can we come in and reset the company back to being a biotech company, essentially skinny the focus of the company back to really being a development-stage company? Our first six months at the company are really focused around, I'll broadly call it clean up, but it was essentially rebooting the company to being a biotech company. We took the company back down to about 38 people. We divested the Discovery Research platform. We renegotiated and got out of all of our future Belviq obligations with our partner, Eisai, and really began to rebuild the clinical development efforts inside the company.\nHarjes: Looking back on that decision to hand the rights back to Eisai, was that the right decision for the company?\nMunshi: Absolutely. We were on the hook for a tremendous amount of money, and it wasn't something we would be rewarded for in the public markets. So, we really tried to create a new value proposition around the pipeline of product candidates that was essentially sitting on a shelf.\nHarjes: So, looking at the pipeline now, what are you most excited about?\nMunshi: As we started 2017, we began a tremendous amount of focus on what we consider our lead compound at that point, which is Ralinepag. Ralinepag is a drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension. PAH is an interesting disease. It's a fatal disease, it's a rare disease. It causes the blood vessels in your lungs to become narrow or blocked, and it gets harder for blood to flow through them, blood pressure increases, the heart has to work harder, and eventually these patients die of right heart failure. The drugs that have been approved to have worked miracles to date, but are insufficient in many ways. We thought we had a potentially best-in-class compound, so we focused really hard on getting that study enrolled for the first part of 2017. We got the study enrolled and reported out data in approximately the middle of '17. The data was unprecedented. We showed an effect size over background therapy that hadn't been seen before. That really set us on this trajectory, and it validated our thesis that there were some great compounds sitting on the shelf.\nHarjes: Can you talk a little bit about competition in that space, and what differentiates your drug?\nMunshi: Sure. The way our compound works is through a pathway called prostacyclin. It's a predominant pathway in the treatment of PAH for these patients. The current compounds really fall basically in two buckets in the prostacyclin category. One is intravenous prostacyclin, which requires patience to be on a pump, and the other is oral. We're an oral agent. The current oral agents, which are of course preferred to intravenous, but they have a very short half-life and are not quite as potent as our compound. And intravenous is the preferred therapy. It's the only drug that has ever shown activity in terms of long-term effects on mortality. So, the idea with our compound was to have a once a day oral that began to look like intravenous prostacyclin. Our product has a 24-hour half-life, and it's roughly 6.5 to tenfold more potent than what's currently considered the gold standard for oral prostacyclin, it's a drug called Selexipag, which is commercialized by Johnson & Johnson. We're really excited. We think this is a breakthrough in the prostacyclin category, and we think this has the opportunity to redefine how patients are treated.\nHarjes: Very exciting. When can patients hopefully look forward to seeing it in the market?\nMunshi: We haven't put up any guidance yet. We have to work through the regulatory pathways. We're currently preparing for a Phase III program. We expect to be in a Phase III program by the second half of 2018. As you know, there's a long path to starting a Phase III program, including a tremendous amount of ongoing correspondence and activity with the regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe.\nHarjes: Absolutely. Turning to another drug in the pipeline, I want to talk a little bit about APD371, which is a cannabinoid drug. Is it fair to call Arena a pot stock because of this one compound?\nMunshi: We get that a lot. Before we go to 371, we have a critical milestone between here and 371, which is Etrasimod. Etrasimod is a drug that has a broad clinical utility across, we think somewhere between 80 and 100 autoimmune conditions. It works on a pathway called S1P modulation. We expect Phase II data from that compound in the first quarter of 2018. Then, right behind that is APD371, our CB2 receptor agonist. It's interesting. We get that question a lot, around whether we're a pot stock or not. The target here isn't a derivative of cannabis, it's not an extract. We're simply targeting one of the many receptors that are indigenous in our body, they exist already in our body. CB2 is widely considered one of the key inflammatory pain regulators in the body. We produce natural compounds in our body that actually hit that receptor, and what we've done is create a fully synthetic compound, has no overlap, no homology, we call it The Two Cannabis, and it targets the CB2 receptor in a very, very selective way. It's also designed to be peripherally restricted, which means that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it does not cross any psychotropic activity. So, our focus is really on the science of the receptor rather than being a cannabinoid.\nHarjes: And the great thing about not crossing the blood-brain barrier is that you don't get that euphoria, hopefully this drug, if it were on the market, could reduce some of the reliance on opioids. So, given that there is this -- very tangential, as you explained, but still -- relationship to marijuana, are there any complications that you have with this drug in particular with the regulatory sense, or even just getting the clinical trials up and rolling, that you wouldn't find with other drugs?\nMunshi: There's two parts to that question. First is, on the regulatory side, we don't know yet. We're in a Phase II A pilot study, we're a long way from having very detailed regulatory conversations about being able to measure reliance, or how this compares to opioids in terms of addiction. The second part of the question, in terms of enrolling these studies, the studies that are ongoing now are at looking at pain associated with Crohn's disease. We're actually quite astounded, as we went out and did a lot of feasibility work, how many patients, depending on state by state, but how many patients are actually on cannabis in Crohn's disease. It's actually quite stunning. Of course, we can't have a patient on cannabis when they're taking our drug. So, that does pose a challenge, in terms or recruiting patients. However, understanding that cannabis alone is not a solution, and these patients have lingering pain, and cannabis is a partial receptor agonist to CB2, which means it only partially blocks the receptor, whereas we're a full agonist. So, we think we have the opportunity to create even greater pain relief for these patients.\nHarjes: Very interesting. One question that I want to ask has to do with the broader business strategy. When you look at the company, would you consider a buyout a good outcome? Is that something that, as an executive, you would like to see?\nMunshi: Again, that's a question we get routinely. What's your game plan, are you looking to get sold. I don't think a company ever looks to get sold. I think what you do is attempt to build the best company you can, you remain as capital efficient as you can, you progress the compounds in as diligent away as you possibly can. And the game plan is always control what you can control. You can never control if someone wants to acquire the company. We're publicly traded, everyone knows what the value of the company is. Our focus internally has nothing to do with that. Our focus is just to build the best company we possibly can, and create as much value for shareholders and patients as we can.\nHarjes: That's a good answer, it's very similar to what we tell investors, which is, don't buy a company because you hope that it gets acquired. Buy a company because you think it's a good company. And if it gets acquired, that just means somebody else also thought it was a good company.\nMunshi: Absolutely. We talk internally just about controlling our own destiny, and making decisions that allow us to build a long-term game plan for the company. Again, as a public company, we have fiduciary responsibilities to our shareholders. If someone came knocking, we have an obligation to listen and evaluate the appropriate value of the company. But our focus is absolutely to build out these compounds. And between Ralinepag readout last year, we're getting ready for Phase III in '18, the Etrasimod readout in the first quarter of '18, APD371, and we've publicly, now, stated that we anticipate bringing additional products online in the back end of 2018. So, we have a really deep and rich portfolio. And our responsibility is to progress them, so we can create value for shareholders and patients.\nHarjes: Perfect. Since we're here at J.P. Morgan, I want to give our listeners a little bit of a taste for the conference. As somebody that will be presenting at the conference, what are your main goals? What has this conference been like for you?\nMunshi: The main goal for the week is first and foremost to stay awake, and get through the gauntlet of meetings. We've had tremendous investor interest as a company. I think we're looking down the barrel of about 80 or so investor meetings this week. So, getting through the investor meetings, being able to continuously tell a cogent story, respond to investor inquiries. This is a fantastic start to the year. It's a catalyst to the year, and it leads to a lot of follow-up conversations. As we go through the year, a good chunk of these investors that we talk to this week, there will be follow-up conversations. We're constantly looking for investors who haven't heard the new Arena story, who remember, as most of your listeners do, the original Belviq story around the company. And we've had tremendous success in getting new people interested in the equity. So, we want to continue to talk to new investors, we're going to continue to use this meeting as a catalyst for the rest of the year.\nHarjes: Perfect. Thank you so much for joining me here today!\nMunshi: Thank you so much! Take care.\nHarjes: Last but not least -- in fact, this was the company I was most excited to talk to -- is Spark Therapeutics CEO, Jeff Marrazzo.\nI am here with the CEO of Spark Therapeutics, Jeff Marrazzo. Jeff, how's it going?\nJeffrey Marrazzo: I'm doing great! Thank you!\nHarjes: Thanks for being here with me today. Your first drug was approved almost a month earlier than expected by the FDA, and I'm kind of interested from a human angle, how was that day in the office? How did it all go down?\nMarrazzo: It was a fabulous day. It was a day where, there's few moments, certainly in your professional life, that will rise to that moment. It was first and foremost a day where we all took a step back and realized how special it was for patients first. This is a group of diseases, inherited retinal diseases, where patients before that moment, had had no treatment options available to them pharmacologically. So, it was a really special day for patients. I dare say it was a historical moment for medicine, because you're talking about a first-ever gene therapy for a genetic disease approved in the United States. And it was certainly an incredibly proud day for all of us at Spark to not only see what had been days, weeks, months, years, decades of hard work, depending on who you're talking about in the organization, all come together as a team and get to that moment of an approval, it's an amazing moment, one that you don't soon forget.\nHarjes: I'm sure it was incredible. And congratulations to you and your team on that approval!\nMarrazzo: Thank you.\nHarjes: As you look to pivot to commercial stage, can you talk me through some of the challenges, and what you're doing to meet those?\nMarrazzo: Sure. One of the things we announced last week was not only our wholesale acquisition cost, but I think just as importantly, three novel payment and distribution models that we think are important in establishing access for patients that might be eligible for Luxturna, as well as, we think, beginning to set some of the principles for how other one-time gene therapy treatments could be available and be accessible for patients going forward. So, we announced these three novel models, and the principles behind those models are, first and foremost, we want to make sure that we are demonstrating that we stand behind our product. We've shown through an agreement in principle with Harvard Pilgrim an outcomes-based arrangement where we are not only standing behind the short-term efficacy of the product, but the long-term durability of the product, which of course is a major premise of gene therapy as a promise and a technology.\nSecondly, we've developed an innovative contracting model that would really eliminate some of the markups that payers see on traditional provider administered drugs. It would also allow treatment centers to not have to shell out the dollars that they need to acquire these products, and ultimately, to the benefit of patients, ensure that patients have broad coverage and access as well as rapid access, as well as try to minimize the cost out of pocket for patients. So, we think a model like that is also important in establishing a new way to distribute a drug like Luxturna. Then, third, we are in discussions with the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, CMS, about an alternative way that we might be able to make Luxturna available to people, including through an installment payment option, where payers might be able to pay over time. All these things, I think, together are about trying to bring the same type of innovation to how we insure access for patients, as we have in the lab, as well as in the clinic, in terms of what we do at Spark.\nHarjes: How do you think that future gene therapies might compare in both price and pricing model to Luxturna?\nMarrazzo: I think each gene therapy, or each therapy in general, needs to be taken in the context of the particular disease, and what effect you're really talking about. I think it all starts with the value of the therapy. The value of the therapy, you've heard us speak to over the preceding couple of months before we were even approved, we think was inherent when we looked at the pharmacoeconomic consequences and value associated with changing the course of someone's sight. But in other drugs, the pharmacoeconomic argument might place a different value on it. Maybe that's because it might be offsetting existing therapeutic expenses, like in the case of our hemophilia product candidates, or in other disease, it might be offsetting the cost of major consequential medical expenses related to surgeries or long-term care expenses. So, I think each product needs to be put into the context of the disease and the value the therapy can bring to that disease in that context. In terms of how it ultimately gets paid for, I think some of the steps that we've taken to try to develop novel payment and distribution models, I think those do become ways, and create a pathway by which other types of one-time gene therapy treatments could be able to be also availed to the market, and provide balance between the access concerns of patients, budgets concerns of payers, and the need for companies like ours to be able to develop a path toward sustainability.\nHarjes: Great, makes a lot of sense. As investors look out over the next couple of quarters, or more importantly, the next couple of years, what would you advise us to look out for, in terms of the actual launch of the product? Do you think the sales figures will be particularly bumpy? And what would you expect to be a smooth state? How far along will it take to get past that initial sales bump?\nMarrazzo: We're not providing specific guidance on Luxturna sales at this point. What we do believe is, what is important, and why we've taken the approach we've taken with Luxturna, not just on the access side but in general, is to really demonstrate that we can execute against turning on the commercial engine and really delivering, ultimately, the promise of gene therapy, not only from the lab to the clinic, but ultimately now to patients in actual practice. So, the ability for us to, if you rev up that commercial engine, get it at full speed and be able to take patients who we believe are eligible, have been diagnosed and are eligible, and get them to be able to get access to the therapy if that's the choice that they make, we're really going to measure ourselves on how well we're doing on that benchmark, on that measurement. And as we get out and have more experience in the market, and get a sense for the pace, and whether there could be some seasonality in the context of when treatments might occur, then I think we'll be able to provide a little more insight into how we might see things go on a quarter to quarter basis. But right now, we're really thinking about the launch in the context of this quarter being really about establishing and setting up those treatment centers to make the product available, and then starting in Q2, all the way through, frankly, 2019, thinking about it holistically as a period where we're really building that commercial engine and getting it up and running and being successful and prosecuting the opportunity and giving patients opportunities to have access.\nHarjes: Got it. Investors and patients alike have been very intrigued by what your company is doing in hemophilia, so I wanted to ask a couple of questions about that. Can you lay out, generally, the opportunity there, and where Spark comes in?\nMarrazzo: I think hemophilia is an incredibly exciting opportunity for gene therapy in general. What you're talking about is dramatically transforming the standard of care. Today, we treat the disease through chronic infusions of factor, and yet despite that, we still have regular episodes of bleeding in patients as they try to manage their disorder. And obviously, every patient is different, and the severity is different, but that's a general principle. And gene therapy has the potential to transform that standard of care, with the single-dose having the potential to dramatically, if not eliminate, the risk of bleeds, as well as eliminate the need for infusions. What's been so exciting about the data that we've seen across our hemophilia portfolio so far is, first of all, in different diseases or different subtypes, were earlier than others that were a bit further on. Still in Phase I and II in both. But, what's been so exciting is, one, the safety data has been very good and very encouraging, we've not seen any serious adverse events, we have not seen any thrombotic events, we've not seeing any inhibitors form. Those are all incredibly important steps as a first step in hemophilia gene therapy.\nWe've also seen dramatic clinical outcomes. We talk about reducing by nearly 100% the bleeding rates in patients who have been in our studies, as well as dramatically almost eliminating, at every instance, the infusion rates that these patients used to have to take once, twice, three times a week. You're talking about totally changing not only the paradigm for a treatment approach in medicine, but importantly, from the patient's perspective, I dare say making them think differently about their disease. And ultimately, not to forget, from a payer perspective, allowing the possibility for cost offsets, really thinking differently about the consequence and the cost to treat this disease in a way that's really transformative and disruptive. It's an incredibly exciting time for the field in general to be applying the technology to hemophilia. We were pleased with the fact that we were able to publish our data from hemophilia B in the New England Journal of Medicine last month. We're incredibly excited and bullish on our progress, albeit early, in hemophilia A. We look forward to providing updates in the second or third quarter of this year as we continue to work toward both planning for a Phase III study while also working to find the optimal dose for that product candidate. But, we're really excited to be a part of the potential solutions in the future for hemophilia.\nHarjes: Why is hemophilia A such a different challenge than hemophilia B?\nMarrazzo: I don't know that it necessarily is. We have been really encouraged by the early data that we've seen. I think our expectation going in was that we might need to do some dose-finding work. Where, in hemophilia B, I will say, if we sat here only two or three weeks after we dosed the first patient in our hemophilia B trial, we probably thought at that point we might have to do some dose-finding work. It turns out, in hemophilia B, we got it right on the first dose. That's sort of atypical. So, we expected we need to do some dose finding work. We were incredibly encouraged that our low dose, the first dose that we tried in our hemophilia A trial, we saw therapeutically relevant levels. We were getting predictable clinical outcomes in the context of the reduction, 100% reduction in bleeds. So, what we're doing is what you'd normally do in most standard Phase I and II studies, which is, you identify a dose that is having clinical outcomes and is safe, but then continue to push and test whether or not there are ways to drive even greater outcomes by doing dose-finding. And that's what we're doing right now. So, we're very confident about the program and look forward to providing updates in the second or third quarter.\nHarjes: Great. Pivoting topics a little bit, there are concerns about the orphan drug tax credit being cut in half. To what extent does that affect your company? And how are you thinking about that? How big of an issue might it be?\nMarrazzo: I think it's a relevant issue. And as far as I understand, it did get modified in the legislation that got passed the House and Senate, it was signed into law by the president late last year. Look, I think at the end of the day, the tool of the orphan drug programs in general has been incredibly effective, not just in helping facilitate access in the regulatory process, but also creating incentives for businesses to invest in diseases where there's very few number of patients who are affected. And if you take a step back, there's about 7,000 rare diseases that affect people in the United States. As I understand it, the last figures were that 6,600 of those 7,000 did not have any treatment. So, despite the remarkable progress that's been made in orphan diseases over the last 20 or 30 years, there's clearly a lot more to go.\nI think gene therapy as a modality and a technology is an exciting one, because for those diseases where you couldn't try to treat it through a regular or recurrent infusion, whether that might be for example, various central nervous system disorders, where you can't do repeat administrations into the brain, because you can't do repeat neural surgical procedure, gene therapy creates a promise that you can only do that procedure one time and it might have a long-lasting effect. And we have multiple programs going on in our lab, in our research efforts, and central nervous system areas as well. So, I think there's a huge need still there. Anything that changes what has been a program that I think has driven success to get to 400 of those diseases having options, the fact that 6,600 still don't have options means that I think the policy was probably working, maybe frankly should have been accelerated, and certainly should have been decelerated, which is effectively what I think the effect of that tax credit changes.\nHarjes: Got it. Before I let you go, I want to give our listeners a sense of the conference. Spark has gotten a lot of attention since last year's conference. How has that changed your experience here at J.P. Morgan?\nMarrazzo: I would say that we really appreciate the fact that people in general, whether they be from the investor side of the world, whether it's patients, whether it's healthcare professionals or payers, my view is, all of the stakeholders in the system, we need to find ways to partner with people to develop new solutions whether it be for the development of a new technology or the development of new payment models. I think there's a shared responsibility that a company like Spark has with a lot of other people. We don't get this done alone. We have to partner with people, we have to share in that responsibility with people. So, I certainly welcome the opportunity to people to come up and chat with us and talk about ways that we can work together to make, ultimately, solutions like one-time transformative treatments, which I think are the future, where medicine is going. Not only adopted as fast as it can be, but even faster, if that's possible.\nHarjes: Yeah, absolutely. Do you have a favorite moment from the conference so far?\nMarrazzo: Some of my favorite moments are when, I've spent a bunch of the last couple of days in meetings with investors. I always certainly appreciate when people come in and begin with that congratulatory remark on the approval. It was certainly an amazing moment, as we spoke about at the beginning of this interview, for us at Spark. And for those investors in particular who have been with us for a long time, I always share with them that they have been very much a partner in that journey, and usually the opportunity to turn around and say to them, \"Thank you for the support along that way!\" It's a huge part of us being successful. I believe the fact that we've had a number of our shareholders for a long time, stuck with us, and been with us for a long time. So, the success that we had, I hope that they share in that as well.\nHarjes: Yeah, and I'm sure they're hoping to stay around as investors for a long time, as well.\nMarrazzo: That's my hope, too.\nHarjes: Well, thank you so much for your time today!\nMarrazzo: Thank you!\nHarjes: That's everything I have lined up for the show. It's been an amazing few days here at the conference. I hope you've all enjoyed getting a taste of it. Shameless plug, I now have a Twitter account that I made while I was in my Lyft from the Oakland Airport to my hotel, so it's brand new. You can find me @KristineHarjes. A quick thank you to all the listeners who took the time to meet up with me at the conference. It was amazing meeting you all face to face. An especially big thank you to Austin Morgan this week for stitching together these various clips and not uttering a single word of complaint, despite me still needing to call him for tech support after fully training me back at HQ on how a recorder works. The guy is a real champion! As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Kristine Harjes. Thanks for listening and Fool on!\n}}

{{The Show Us Your Bills investigations have helped viewers erase nearly $300,000 in medical overcharges and billing errors. Every time 9News airs a story, another dozen viewers send them detailed highly personal medical bills looking for help. The series caught fire when 9News reported the story of a man who went to the emergency room to have a splinter removed from his thumb. \u201cHe got a $2,100 bill,\u201d Vanderveen said. \u201cThat seemed stupid.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any intention of following medical billing stories for years, but at the end of that first story we put up an email, showusyourbills@9news.com , and it became a treasure trove of stories. People were willing to send us their medical bills,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew they were mad but I didn\u2019t know they were that mad.\u201d \u201cWe are not surprised by anything anymore,\u201d Wilcox told Poynter. \u201cThere is no shocking amount of money that they charge that surprises us.\u201d\nReporting on complex medical issues can be tough, so the journalists break them down into \u201csmall, digestible, narrowly focused stories\u201d and mix in \u201ctouches of satire and mockery,\u201d the story explains. Here\u2019s something else that jumped out at me in the piece, which came after a line noting how the journalists were hounding local hospital CEOs who wouldn\u2019t comment:\nKeep in mind that these hospitals are also big advertisers. \u201cThey spend a ton of money on marketing,\u201d Vanderveen said. \u201cThey are not used to being pushed back on. They are used to TV stations doing countless \u2018medical miracle stories\u2019 and those are good stories but the PR departments are not used to anybody questioning them on the pricing structure.\u201d 9News took the reporting, which sometimes looked more like teaching, beyond the evening newscasts. Vanderveen and Wilcox produced in-depth Facebook conversations where for a half-hour they drilled down on hard-to-understand topics like \u201cbalance billing\u201d and explained how to fight unjust charges.\n\u201cThe social media conversations not only answered viewer questions,\u201d Poynter wrote, \u201cbut they also provided some insight into the depth of knowledge that these journalists have developed after two years of studying hospital billings.\u201d\nThe journalists\u2019 public- engagement went beyond social media, though. One of them testified at the Capitol\u2026\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ll add to Poynter\u2019s great work spotlighting this important coverage: Earlier this year, Vanderveen turned some reporter heads at the state Capitol when he showed up and testified in a legislative committee on a bill that dealt with one of the medical issues 9News was digging into. \u201cAs a reporter I must say right away that neither myself nor my employer are taking a position on this particular piece of legislation for obvious reasons,\u201d he told the lawmakers assembled before him. Then he asked a rapid-fire set of interrogatories:\n\u201cBut I would pose some questions to the panel that include: Does anyone even know what STARK really says? Does anyone prepared to vote on this even know what STARK says? Does anyone on this committee know why STARK does not protect most Coloradans? Does anyone on this committee know why STARK laws wouldn\u2019t apply to me, for example, Chris Vanderveen, investigative reporter? Does anyone on this bill know why \u2026 this bill, a healthcare bill is being heard in the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee? And should doctors be able to refer their patients to their own companies while not letting their patients know about those particular relationships? And my last question, because I have not been able to figure this one out and if you could answer it for me I would really appreciate it: Why in the heck are so many Coloradans getting checks in excess of $100,000 from their insurance companies to pay for inter-operative neuromonitoring? If you can answer for me that question you would have solved a riddle I have been trying to discover for more than eight months.\u201d\nAt the time, four print reporters and at least one lawmaker grumbled about a journalist involving himself in the legislative process or about his demeanor. \u201cWhen did this become OK?\u201d one asked me. \u201cMy mouth was agape,\u201d another reporter told me afterward. \u201cI generally like the idea of pinning these questions down on camera,\u201d said another, \u201cbut maybe tone matters?\u201d Vanderveen tells me the project has always been about giving a voice to patients who are all too often left out of the discussion \u2014 particularly at the state Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m proud we\u2019ve gone down this road,\u201d he says via email. \u201cHave we taken some unorthodox approaches in this now three-year long series of stories on health care billing? Yep. That\u2019s ok. I believe it\u2019s time for journalists to cover not only the story but the process that allows the story to happen in the first place.\u201d He says he\u2019s fine with some reporters thinking he went too far or if any lawmakers were critical of the approach. He cleared his remarks with the station\u2019s management, he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to push this,\u201d Vanderveen adds. \u201cIn ways that might make people uncomfortable. It\u2019s time for that. Journalists aren\u2019t doing their jobs if everyone likes what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nWho read that $18.5 million contract? Oh. Right.\n\u201cWho caught that the contract for the new CU coach was for a year longer than law allows? Not the lawyers,\u201d said Denver Post editor Lee Ann Colacioppo on Twitter. \u201cNot the regents,\u201d either. It was a reporter for her paper. \u201cThat\u2019s what journalists do: Actually read the contracts,\u201d she said. The post was a tease for a story headlined, \u201cColorado accidentally approved an illegal contract for new football coach Mel Tucker.\u201d From the piece by Matt L. Stephens:\nState law prohibits any higher education employee to be contracted for more than five years. So why did University of Colorado Board of Regents approve a six-year contract for new football coach Mel Tucker on Wednesday? In a word: oops.\nHeh. Oops indeed. And they all might have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn\u2019t been for those meddling reporters.\nColorado Public Radio keeps expanding. Now to Washington, D.C.\nThat\u2019s according to a recent job listing for CPR, which says the station is looking for a reporter to produce \u201cbreaking news and enterprise from DC that resonates with a Colorado audience.\u201d The reporter \u201cwill cover the Colorado Congressional delegation and other Colorado-related national political figures and monitor federal agencies that are developing policy that affects Coloradans.\u201d That\u2019s what Mark K. Matthews used to do for The Denver Post before he left this summer for a job covering the environment at E&E News. Might it be possible that the only full-time dedicated reporter covering Colorado\u2019s federal delegation from D.C. will be for CPR? If so, that marks a rather striking shift in journalism here and is perhaps a commentary on the benefits of the public membership model for media ownership.\nSpeaking of CPR\u2026\nDuring a recent segment about the 2018 legislative session on a year-end wrap-up taping of the PBS public affairs TV show \u201cInside Out,\u201d one of Colorado media\u2019s go-to political prognosticators, Eric Sondermann, had this to say: \u201cThe most important person around the Capitol last year was not John Hickenlooper or 100 legislators, it was Bente Birkeland.\u201d That\u2019s right, a reporter. \u201cYou were always waiting for what new story Bente was going to break on who was literally getting caught with their pants down.\u201d Birkeland was the journalist behind a series of sexual harassment scoops from the \u2018dark underbelly\u2019 of Colorado\u2019s Capitol she broke as a reporter for KUNC and Rocky Mountain Community Radio. On the \u201cInside Out\u201d show, host Dominic Dezzutti pointed out that Birkeland has since moved from KUNC to Colorado Public Radio.\nWhat you missed on the Sunday front pages across Colorado\nA Colorado crazy neighbor story\nCrazy uncles. Crazy neighbors. Everyone\u2019s gotta story this holiday season. So here\u2019s a nutty news nugget from our neighboring state of Arizona. It kinda has it all: An \u201caward-winning newspaper publisher,\u201d a \u201cbizarre divorce case,\u201d allegations of poisoning, meth, \u201can ad accusing her by name, with a photo of her, bordered with images of skulls and rats,\u201d an $18 million lawsuit, \u201chair and nail samples\u201d sent to a Colorado lab, a newspaper \u201cleft on her driveway, even though she wasn\u2019t a subscriber.\u201d And all of it wrapped up in a \u201cjournalism ethics saga.\u201d I\u2019ll bite. Here\u2019s that link again.\nA new weekly print publication in the Roaring Fork Valley\n\u201cMake no mistake, starting a new \u2018paper delivered\u2019 product at this moment in the media environment is a risky proposition.\u201d That\u2019s David Cook, publisher of The Aspen Daily News, with the understatement of the week. But it\u2019s a risk he\u2019s taking with the new launch of a print publication called The Roaring Fork Weekly Journal to serve Basalt, Willits and El Jebel, Carbondale and Fryingpan Valley.\nM. John Fayhee, an author-journalist who spent more than a dozen years editing The Mountain Gazette, will helm the paper\u2019s editorial side. Anyone familiar with his work, he told KDNK in a recent interview, \u201cknowns that I am far more attracted to off-beat stuff than I am to town council meetings \u2026 we\u2019re definitely going to be open to silly stuff.\u201d The journal, which has a bi-lingual correspondent, he added, will \u201cstrive to include the Latino community \u2026 we\u2019re going to definitely spend a lot of effort making sure that the Latino community is going to be involved in this publication.\u201d\nSo, why a new publication? Cook, Fayhee wrote in the paper\u2019s launch issue, \u201ccorrectly observed that this part of the Roaring Fork Valley has long been grossly underserved by the local media. More than one resident has described the Mid-Valley as too often being lost in the newspaper shuffle, getting short coverage shrift compared to Aspen, Carbondale and Glenwood Springs.\u201d\nA well-regarded nonprofit weekly paper already exists in Carbondale called The Sopris Sun. The Aspen Daily News, Aspen Times, Glenwood Springs Post-Independent and other outlets also cover the area. \u201cI think that if we really focus on what needs to be covered and not just going after each other\u2019s throats then the end result is going to be very positive for the reader and for the community,\u201d Cook told KDNK. One of the first stories the new publication dug into was about open meetings issue in the town of Basalt, and the RFWJ has already filed an open records request.\nMeanwhile, a JeffCo community weekly is shutting down\nWhile one new weekly launches, another folds. RIP the Columbine Courier, \u201cwhich has reported on communities, including Columbine and Ken Caryl, since about 1990,\u201d according to BusinessDen. The paper, part of the Evergreen Newspapers network, has been unprofitable for years, publisher Kristin Witt told the site. More from BusinessDen:\nWitt said readership has been strong. Staff put out about 10,000 issues on racks each week, and typically end up bringing back about 200, she said. The two reporters who wrote for the Columbine Courier will remain with the company, filing for the other publications. Witt said some Columbine Courier readers have expressed disappointment that the title is going out of print, and she\u2019s exploring having The Canyon Courier report on the area. Witt said The Canyon Courier already reports on county issues, which are relevant in both Evergreen and Columbine. But to justify covering more local issues, a sizable chunk of Columbine-area residents need to subscribe to the Evergreen paper, she said.\nBut, she told the site, while the free weekly covering portions of Jefferson County is going poof, Evergreen Newspaper\u2019s two other publications \u201clook very strong and have a bright future.\u201d\n\u2026As another print paper launches in the Springs\nAll aboard the Southeast Express, a new nonprofit print newspaper serving the southeastern community in Colorado Springs. \u201cThe paper is the newest addition to Colorado Publishing House and is powered by the technical and logistical support of the Colorado Springs Independent, Colorado Springs Business Journal, the Manitou Springs-focused community newspaper The Pikes Peak Bulletin and the Colorado Military Newspaper Group,\u201d according to its website. The tabloid-style publication will hit the streets in February and will start out publishing every other month. Two alums from The Pueblo Chieftain are working on the project. Regan Foster is editor and Jayson Peters is its digital production manager. John Weiss, who owns the papers listed above, is the publisher. (I have a photo of the print prototype here.) Jesse Metzger, a student at Colorado College, recently sat in on a meeting with Foster and Weiss and passed along some notes. He says Foster called the city\u2019s southeastern part of town a \u201cnews desert\u201d and told him the paper would report on politics and elections. The new paper will also use an unusual distribution model. \u201cThe plan, according to Weiss, is to mail copies of the tabloid to roughly 30,000 homes within the target district at no cost to readers,\u201d Metzger writes.\nA Colorado media baron gets the David Brooks treatment\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks says he only met the publicity shy media mogul and conservative Denver billionaire Phil Anschutz a few times. \u201cMy impressions on those occasions was that he was a run-of-the-mill arrogant billionaire,\u201d Brooks wrote in a recent column. \u201cHe was used to people courting him and he addressed them condescendingly from the lofty height of his own wealth.\u201d Ouch. What was the occasion for such a Mr. Burns treatment from Mr. Brooks? The death of the Anschutz-owned Weekly Standard, a conservative newspaper that has used its pages and influence to criticize Republican President Donald Trump. Brooks doesn\u2019t just go after Anschutz in his gossip column, though, he also sets his sights on one of the media mogul\u2019s deputies, Ryan McKibben, based on \u201cstories about him [that] have circulated around Washington over the years.\u201d Brooks accuses them both of magazine murder, executed by \u201ccorporate drones\u201d of the \u201cbureaucratic mind.\u201d (On a personal note, the most interesting place I ever found a copy of The Weekly Standard was in a pile of magazines in a coffeeshop in the spiritual ground zero of Crestone, Colorado.)\nA Colorado native runs the \u2018northernmost English-language publication in the world\u2019\nIt\u2019s far away \u2014 the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, actually \u2014 where Colorado native Mark Sabbatini runs a newspaper called Ice People, which is \u201cthe world\u2019s northernmost English-language publication,\u201d according to The Providence Journal in Rhode Island. But running a newspaper is expensive\u2014 anywhere\u2014 and Sabbatini\u2019s publication is a one-man operation. He\u2019s getting some help, though, from an \u201c11-year-old East Greenwich native with a thing for the Arctic\u201d whose parents took him to Svalbard where he met Sabbatini and is now running a crowd-funding campaign to help financially support Ice People.\nSo, add one for the what-will-save-journalism file: 11-year-old kids from East Greenwich. May we all find our own and long may they run.\n}}

{{war on coal\nRepublicans are taking coal miners\u2019 pensions and their healthcare. (UPDATED)\nCoal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. Those who survive long careers in the mines are often plagued by chronic disease, including black lung. Unlike most Americans, however, about 120,000 ex-miners draw their pension and health care from the 1940s-era United Mine Workers of America fund, which is flat-out broke today.\nThose benefits will expire at the end of the year unless the Senate steps in.\nSenate Democrats are trying to pass the Miners Protection Act, which would require money from a federal abandoned-mine-reclamation program to pay for the pensions and healthcare of tens of thousands of coal miners, both active and retired.\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and fellow anti-union Republicans have fought the Act, and unless they decide to compromise, this fight could actually shut down the government. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) have pledged to block a federal funding bill unless Republicans act.\nPresident-elect Trump campaigned on bringing back those same coal miners\u2019 jobs (through sorcery, perhaps.)

{{There are lots of exciting biotech stocks that investors can consider owning in their growth portfolios. But according to Motley Fool Industry Focus: Healthcare analyst Shannon Jones and Fool contributor Todd Campbell, Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) and Regenxbio (NASDAQ:RGNX) are two stocks that ought to be top of mind.\nNeurocrine Biosciences is already racking up significant revenue growth from one drug it has on the market, and clinical-stage trials could increase sales even more. Meanwhile, Regenxbio is leveraging its proprietary platform of viral vectors to tap into the emerging market for gene therapies. Can these companies generate profit-friendly returns for shareholders?\nIn today's show, Jones and Campbell discuss:\nSales growth for Neurocrine Biosciences' Ingrezza.\nNeurocrine Biosciences' potential to expand Ingrezza's label to include Tourette's syndrome.\nAn opportunity for Neurocrine Biosciences in Parkinson's disease.\nThe competitive advantages associated with Regenxbio's viral vectors.\nAn early stage wet age-related macular degeneration therapy in Regenxbio's pipeline.\nHow Regenxbio may benefit soon from a relationship with biopharma giant Novartis NYSE:NVS)\nAlso, Jones and Campbell discuss why game-changing data from Amarin's (NASDAQ:AMRN) cardiovascular outcomes study for Vascepa, a purified fish-oil pill, could send its sales soaring.\nA full transcript follows the video.\nThis video was recorded on Sept. 26, 2018.\nShannon Jones: Welcome to Industry Focus, the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Wednesday, September the 26th, and we're talking healthcare. I'm your host, Shannon Jones. I'm joined in the studio with Motley Fool contributor Todd Campbell via Skype. On today's show, we're diving into one of the most widely anticipated trial readouts for Amarin and their fish oil pill, believe it or not. We'll also be revealing our favorite biotech picks. That's all in this week's episode of Industry Focus: Healthcare.\nTodd, I don't know about you, but for me, September has been a wild and very interesting month for the biopharma world.\nTodd Campbell: Oh, absolutely! The Amarin Vascepa data that we just got has to rank in the top five, at least, of crazy things that we've seen in biopharma this month, if not higher.\nJones: Yeah, I definitely would say it has to be within the top five. I would dare say it's maybe No. 2 or No. 3, even, given the anticipation leading up to the trial, everything that's happened prior to the trial, and what the results showed. We'll get into all of that.\nBut first, Todd, I know you and Kristine did an awesome background leading up to this cardiovascular outcome study. That was the first Wednesday in September. I'd really encourage our listeners to go back, listen to that episode. They did an awesome job setting the stage of this binary event for Amarin. But let's give a very brief background to our listeners that are catching up, let's just tell them why this trial was so, so important for Amarin.\nCampbell: Amarin markets a drug called Vascepa. Vascepa is a purified omega three fatty acid. We'll call it EPA. It's been on the market since 2012 for use in reducing triglycerides, fat in the blood, in patients that have very high triglyceride readings, greater than 500 milligrams per deciliter. The approval in the very high population, however, only scratches the surface of the addressable market. There are literally tens of millions of patients that have elevated triglyceride levels.\nAmarin had conducted a trial to see whether or not patients with moderate triglyceride levels -- 152 to 500 -- would benefit from Vascepa. Sure enough, their triglyceride levels fell in that trial. But the FDA said, \"We're not going to approve its use in that moderate patient population because frankly, no one has proven that lowering triglycerides,\" again, fat in the bloodstream, \"actually translates into saving people's lives, reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack and, yes, death.\" About 800,000 people die every year from cardiovascular events.\nAmarin, recognizing that the big money was to be made in being able to roll this drug out to a much bigger, broader population, began conducting a study to tie and make that link that yes, if you take Vascepa, it will lower triglycerides. And yes, if it lowers triglycerides, that will indeed save people's lives and prevent heart attack and stroke.\nSeven years in the making, the study has finally read out results. And sure enough, Shannon, it was, I would say, as good as they could have hoped for.\nJones: Yeah, and really even better. I think it's safe to say too, expectations leading up to this trial, while everyone was anxious to see exactly what the readout would be, the expectations were relatively low, given the multiple study failures when it comes to cardiovascular outcome studies. The most recent one was the Ascend study, which effectively found that generic fish oils -- granted, relatively low dose compared to Vascepa in this study -- weren't effective in the prevention of these cardiovascular events.\nOf course, Amarin was very quick to come out and counter the results of that study, reiterating and reemphasizing the purity of Vascepa. As you talked about with EPA, not a mixture of all these other types of fatty acids.\nCampbell: Right, DHA elevating bad cholesterol levels is thought to have been why the supplements failed. Those supplements also included DHA alongside EPA. That's not the case with Vascepa. It is pure EPA.\nJones: Yes. Amarin been really driving that point home. Leading up to the study, it's really been on the top of everyone's mind looking to see if, indeed, that makes a difference. Just like you said, it sounds like it did. Let's dive right in. What it exactly did Amarin find in this particular trial?\nCampbell: They enrolled patients that had bad cholesterol levels that were controlled by statins. We're talking patients who take statins, which are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. I think 38 million Americans alone take statins every day for their high bad cholesterol. They enrolled patients that were on cholesterol-controlling medications, but still had high triglyceride levels.\nWhat they found is that taking four grams per day of Vascepa translated into an additional 25% reduction in the risk of a major cardiovascular event, including stroke, heart attack, and death. 25%. That, Shannon, is on top of the 25% reduction in risk that's historically been associated with taking statins. So, a really remarkable finding.\nJones: Absolutely, yes. Honestly, I think Wall Street and the scientific community would have been fine with a 15% reduction in risk. To see 25% really wowed everybody. We'll get more detailed data moving forward. We've got the American Heart Association meeting happening November the 10th.\nSpecifically for me, I'm really curious to dig into the slicing and dicing of the data a little bit more. What you see with a lot of these cardiovascular outcomes studies are these composite endpoints. The endpoints basically, as you mentioned, Todd, they're looking at a number of different events. You talked about stroke, heart attack, death, even. They combine all of those endpoints into one, and that's really what they reported out on this week. What we'll see coming into November is more detail into that.\nI'm also curious to see which patient groups responded better than others. Also, I mean, with so much focus being on triglyceride levels, I'm really curious to see just how much Vascepa was able to lower those levels, too. Those are the things that are in the top of my mind heading into that meeting.\nCampbell: The big question that every investor is going to have is, how big could this drug get? They did $180 million in sales last year, I think they were targeting $230 million for this year already. That's just on the severe high triglyceride approval way back in 2012. I think that totally undersells it, now that this data is out. I would not be surprised if cardiologists are going to be talking to their patients about this drug very, very soon. It is, again, potentially a life-saving drug.\nNow, I happen to have family members who have a history of stroke. My father, for example, is on statins and other drugs to try and rein in that risk. He had told me in the past that he was on fish oil pills. So, when I saw this data, I called him up and I said, \"Hey, did you see this great data?\" He goes, \"Oh, yeah, I stopped taking my fish oil pills because of that failed study of the over the counter supplements.\" It wouldn't be shocking to me, if my dad's cardiologist, a lot of people's cardiologists, started having conversations with them about Vascepa. Again, 25% relative risk reduction on top of the statins is pretty remarkable.\nThis is a massive addressable market. Amarin estimates that over 50 million adults in the United States have triglyceride level readings that are above 150 milligrams per deciliter. Obviously they won't get that big, but is there the potential for this to be a billion-dollar blockbuster drug? I think there is now.\nJones: Absolutely. I've heard the terms being thrown around as a true game changer, paradigm shift in how we treat patients. I really think, to your point, you will start to see the uptake in prescribing habits when it comes to Vascepa. Amarin is actually aiming to file the supplemental MD&A by early 2019. Anticipated approval within this specific indication coming by late 2019. I fully anticipate you'll see a bump up in sales even before that.\nAnother interesting thing, too, there's not really an immediate direct competitor for Amarin in this space right now. The closest one is actually AstraZeneca. They've got right now a strength trial. They're also looking at a 4 gr daily dose of their drug. It's interesting, though, because for AstraZeneca, their drug is one of those mixed omega three fatty acids. I believe it's called Epanova. That will be reading out in 2019. I think it will be a really interesting read out, to see what we can extract from that study, are there any read throughs when it comes to dosing level. It's just going to be an exciting 2019, to say the least.\nCampbell: [laughs] Yeah, very much so! We're definitely going to watch those prescription trends over the course the next few quarters for this company. It's also going to be interesting to see whether or not a larger company decides to step ahead of the AstraZeneca data, or they end up waiting until that data is out to see what that competitive landscape may look like further on down the road. Vascepa really is the only engine in the car that is Amarin. It'll be really interesting to see what ends up happening with this company in the next year or two.\nJones: Yeah, absolutely. Always good to have positive trial news, especially in biopharma land, and especially to see this with a drug that's not your typical biotech drug. It is literally fish oil. We even saw this, too, with CBD and marijuana. Someone even said in the bio Twitter world that this is really the year of natural medicines making a run for it. Fascinating stuff, really great science. We'll be keeping an eye on that. We'll be sure to keep our listeners up to speed with all the comings and goings of who may be entering this market space.\nBut first, we'll want to switch gears. We're going to talk about our personal top biotech picks on the other side of the break.\nAs fascinating as Amarin's fish oil pill is, there's an equally fascinating company on Todd Campbell's radar right now, in one of the hottest areas in biotech right now, which is gene therapy. Gene therapy really brings with it the promise of novel one-time treatments that target the underlying causes of disease at the genetic level. Todd, tell us about your top pick, and why you love it so much.\nCampbell: This is going to sound kind of funny for me to talk about this, because oftentimes, I'll say to people who ask, I typically try to avoid young, early stage companies. The risk of trial failure is so high. Yet, every once in a while, there'll be a company that has some pretty remarkable competitive advantages that basically makes me stand up go, \"This is kind of an interesting company, it's definitely one worth exploring a little bit more.\" That was the case with this stock, Regenxbio, symbol RGNX.\nThe reason that I'm really interested and intrigued by this company is twofold. They have a proprietary collection of adeno associated viral vectors. Those AAVs can be used to enable gene therapies, to get into the tissue and actually do the work of creating that change in the way that the genes function.\nThere are about 6,000 diseases that are caused by genetic mutations. The whole concept with gene therapy is to be able to go in and either restore the gene function by adding some genetic code or restore appropriate gene function by deleting a part of code. We've talked about this in the past on the show, it's called gene editing.\nRegenxbio's AAVs are intriguing because what they're used for is to deliver the gene therapy into the tissue to make the change and theoretically restore correct genetic function. They argue that their AAVs are the best there are out there, that their AAV platform will not only create less of an immune reaction within patients that they're given to, which allows for more durable, long lasting results; but they're going to be easier and cheaper to manufacturer, too. That removes a big hurdle that's been overhanging the gene therapy market.\nJones: You've got a really novel platform, and it sounds like they're going to be targeting some really high unmet need areas, as well. What can you tell us about the indications they're going after?\nCampbell: They have two business approaches. The first business approach is a licensing approach, where they allow drug makers to come in and license the use of their AAVs in exchange for some upfront money, maybe some milestone payments, depending on their clinical trial success, and then royalties if a drug is eventually commercialized. That's one part of their business model. The other part of their business model is to develop their own internal candidates for genetic diseases that they can usher through their own clinical trials and theoretically partner out later on or just go ahead and launch them on their own.\nTheir own projects are pretty early stage projects. But, one of those projects that's most advanced is incredibly intriguing because it targets wet age-related macular degeneration, a multibillion dollar market that's dominated by Eylea, $5.2 billion a year drug. Their goal is to develop a gene therapy that can be a one-and-done -- or maybe a twice a year; who knows, we'll see -- therapy that would avoid the need for patients with wet AMD to go into the office every three months or eight weeks or whatever and have to have an injection done in their eye to help restore their vision. That is particularly exciting to me because they reported some data this past summer from a Phase I study that showed that there was a dose-dependent reaction to their medication, to their gene therapy. And, half of the patients in the highest dose cohort were injection-free after six months. They're actually continuing that study, ramping up to include another dose cohort that's a higher dose. Data from that additional cohort could be available before the end of this year. Phase II trials could begin for that medicine as soon as 2019. That's on the internal program side.\nOn the external program side, the closest drug that's to commercialization is a Novartis gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, SMA. Earlier this year, Novartis went out and spent $8.7 billion to acquire AveXis, to get its hands on this drug, AVXS-101. They plan to file for FDA approval of that drug soon, potentially getting that drug on the market next year. If so, if the FDA gives it to go ahead, then Regenxbio should be able to collect mid-single digits to low double-digit royalties on sales. That's significant, Shannon, because the one drug that's out there right now for use in that indication is Biogen's Spinraza, and that's tracking $1.5 billion in sales per year as of last quarter.\nJones: For our listeners that have been following along, Spinraza had a phenomenal launch trajectory. Granted, it's been tapering off over time. But when you think about the closest competitors, AveXis is top of mind for many investors right now, in terms of how the dynamics would change once they come to market, if they come to market, if the data are worthy of approval.\nGoing back to what you were mentioning, I'm really intrigued. This wasn't a company I followed, I haven't been following it all, really, until you mentioned it, Todd. That wet AMD indication is extremely intriguing for a couple of reasons. One, you mentioned the patient populations. That's a population that's really only going to increase as you see the baby boomer generation continuing to grow and live longer. You talked about the competitive landscape with Eylea. You've also got Lucentis, Avastin. Those, of course, require multiple doses. If Regenxbio can get a one-and-done or close to one-and-done approach, I think the opportunity is huge here.\nIt'll be really, really interesting to see, if this gets approved, where pricing will fall. Of course, with gene therapies, we know that they can easily command hundreds of thousands of dollars. Compared to the competitive landscape, that would be a huge jump for many prescribers and patients. I think the opportunity is interesting. It'll be really, really interesting to watch that space, too.\nCampbell: Maybe you end up with some novel pricing programs that get announced if this thing ever does make it to market. Again, we're talking way out in the future. I always want to tamp down on a little bit of enthusiasm because the information that we've seen so far is Phase I. That's as early stage data as you can get.\nYou make a great point. If you're talking about, right now, patients normally getting six or seven injections per year, you multiply the cost of each one of those injections. And then you say, \"Well, what if I'm diagnosed with wet AMD, I'm 70, and I end up living until 85? The next 15 years, I'm going to have six of these injections per year.\" How do you price that? So, that will be interesting.\nBut, I think it's a multibillion dollar indication. Theoretically, this could shake it up if data in Phase II, and eventually in Phase III, confirm what we saw in this very, very small Phase I cohort.\nJones: Todd, what do you think in terms of their cash runaway right now? Do you feel like they've got enough on the books right now to fund those trials moving forward?\nCampbell: They'll need to tap cash at some point, tap investors for cash at some point. Maybe that'll be a little bit dilutive. That's not unexpected for clinical stage companies. But one of the reasons that I like this company is because it does have the potential to bring in those royalty payments beginning next year. That will offset the risk and slow the cash burn for this company. They have about $306 million on the books right now. I think the projecting that they're going to finish the year with somewhere between $250-260 million on the books. That should give them some pretty good runway. Then we'll have to see what happens with AVXS-101 at the FDA, and whether or not Novartis can successfully launch that out against Spinraza.\nJones: So much to look forward to in 2019. This is a truly an interesting company. Gene therapy has really taken off and has gained so much investor enthusiasm and support. We'll see where that one goes.\nLet's turn over to my top pick. My top pick is actually a company called Neurocrine Biosciences, ticker NBIX. The reason why this is my top pick, and it's really one of my favorite stocks, primarily because I've actually been holding on to it for about three years now. I got in early, before Ingrezza got approved. Was really impressed with some of the late stage data. And two, they had a really solid cash position, even at the end of 2015. Then, they also had the backing and credibility of a well-funded partner, which was AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) at the time, too. That's still their partner. So, for me, it checked a lot of the boxes.\nKind of like you, Todd, I try not to get too excited with companies that are yet to have an approved drug on the market. But this one really caught my eye. It was kind of floating under the radar, but was really generating some early traction.\nJust to give our listeners an overview, Neurocrine Biosciences is focused on neurological and endocrine-based diseases. Their first commercialized drug is Ingrezza. That was actually approved in April 2017, became available commercially in May. This is a drug that's been indicated to treat a disease called tardive dyskinesia. It's an involuntary movement disorder that can often be associated with anti-psychotic medications. That's important for a couple of reasons that I'll get to in a minute. This particular drug, in terms of launch trajectory and sales expectations, has really blown them out of the roof.\nJust looking back, Ingrezza generated about $97 million in net product sales in the second quarter of 2018. That's up from $71 million in the first quarter of 2018, giving them about $168 million in net product sales in the first half of the year. This is important because they were really expecting a very slow launch trajectory. When I talk about tardive dyskinesia, and its associated with anti-psychotic medications, one of the reasons is because of the patient population. When you think about it, patients that are on anti-psychotics -- and it's not even confined just to that -- patients that are on that tend to have much lower compliance and adherence rates than other therapeutic classes. So, they were really expecting a much lower launch in trajectory. Generally speaking, for that patient class, you're looking at compliance rates of about 60-70%. Ingrezza has exceeded that, and has been able to hold well above that level. It'll be interesting to see if that does start to taper off over time.\nWhat that says is that not only are prescribers prescribing and that patients are more willing to take it, especially as it relates to being able to suppress many of these involuntary movements that are caused by an irregular dopamine signal that's happening in the brain, Ingrezza is really indicated to stop that mechanism. So far, so good with the launch and the sales.\nCampbell: I was actually surprised. I missed this stock. When you started talking about it, I was like, \"Wow, I really have to do some more work on this name, because this is a fascinating story.\" The fact that they're already at $97 million per quarter, and that's up from $71 million from Q1, that's darn impressive. What's even more impressive is, as I was looking through the 10-Q and some of the other filings, looking at the fact that, that may not be it for Ingrezza. It looks like they're also evaluating its use in other indications, specifically Tourette's.\nJones: Yes. That's going to be a really exciting indication, I think, to read through. Tourette's is another neurological movement disorder. I think the read through to that is huge. That's another multibillion-dollar opportunity, as well.\nOne side thought to that too is, when you look at the marijuana market, you see CBD also potentially being studied in the same indication. You see a lot of darts being thrown at the target. I'll be watching that. But yes, we've got a Tourette's label expansion that's also coming up with Ingrezza.\nThat's not to say that it stops there. Ingrezza was the first approved therapy. Also in late July 2018, in partnership with AbbVie, there is now a drug on the market called Orilissa. AbbVie right now has exclusive worldwide commercialization rights. Neurocrine receives about a 20% royalty on sales. What's interesting about partnering with AbbVie, AbbVie is really known for being the label expansion king. They do that really well. Granted, they have their ups and downs. But they do that really well. It's really interesting, seeing their partnership with Neurocrine here. Right now, Orilissa is approved for moderate to severe endometriosis pain. It's is the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade.\nThe drug hit the market just last month. It's providing yet another source of revenue for a fairly new commercial stage company. We'll be keeping everything a close eye on the launch numbers heading into the latter half of this year for that. That could be, easily, another $1.5-2 billion opportunity. I talked about label expansions, uterine fibroids is another indication that they'll be looking into. Just had some really positive Phase III data in that indication, too.\nThey've got multiple shots on target here. Really, if you look at their pipeline, there are some other really interesting products, too.\nCampbell: Really quickly on that Orilissa, that $1.5 billion in peak sales. If everything goes its way, like you said, AbbVie being so good at expanding labels, conducting trials, getting the most out of their drugs, you could actually get up to that $300 million run rate in royalties for Neurocrine. That would be pretty fantastic.\nYou talked a little bit about the pipeline. One of the things I wanted to see what your thoughts were on is, what do you make of this move into Parkinson's? This licensing deal that it did last year for that Parkinson's disease drug?\nJones: That one was interesting to me, Todd. For our listeners, the drug is called Opicapone. It's currently being studied in Parkinson's disease. I will say, it is approved in Europe as an adjunct therapy in the disease. It's got some kind of positive read through here, particularly as they look to file in the U.S., which could happen as soon as the first half of 2019.\nAnytime I hear Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, I'm a little hesitant. I try not to get my hopes up too much, just because those are diseases that, honestly, we haven't quite figured out what causes it yet. For me, when I'm looking at a potential investment in biotech, I always like to know that the science is well-backed and well understood. This is just one of those areas where I don't feel like we've got a strong enough hold on what actually causes the disease yet. So, I'm a little on the fence on that one, Todd.\nCampbell: I understand, absolutely understand. What's the failure rate in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials? I think it's like 99%.\nJones: 99%, yes.\nCampbell: It's really crazy! I do think, though -- I'm just putting on my hat for a second -- this is a little bit de-risked, for two reasons. One, you've got the EU approval already in hand. Two, you've got the fact that this isn't a game-changing medication. It's a medication that helps the most commonly used Parkinson's disease drug work better. I think that that adjunct status also de-risks this compound. If it can get approved, this could be a big deal. I think there are 60,000 people in the U.S. alone that are getting diagnosed with Parkinson's disease every year, and about a million people with Parkinson's disease. If this drug does reduce the off-time that people suffer when they take Levodopa, then I think you'll see it get pretty widely used. And yet again, you have another drug that could push this company toward profitability, right?\nJones: Absolutely. And they're very, very close to profitability, speaking of. Net loss for the most recent quarter was $5.9 million. That was compared to a loss of $60 million in the same period for 2017. Even before accounting for the Orilissa sales that just came onto the market here in August, they're extremely close. To your point, going back to the Parkinson's opportunity, that, to me, could be a huge game changer for this company itself. We're talking about Ingrezza, we're talking about these other drugs that are already approved. This could really put Neurocrine Biosciences on a completely different level, completely different scale, if that works.\nAnother thing I really, really love about this company is management. This company has been around since the early 90s, but the management team in place right now is particularly tight when it comes to expense control. They do a phenomenal job of level-setting expectations. They will usually tend to set expectations on the lower end when they do. But, just looking at their cash position, they had $800 million at the end of June. Now, you've got sales coming in. Now, you've got royalty payments coming in. They are well-positioned to fund many of these trials, especially in an indication like Parkinson. Feel pretty good there. Granted, I got in on Neurocrine three years ago. The evaluation has jumped up quite a bit since then. I don't plan to sell anytime soon, but definitely is a bit lofty right now.\nCampbell: Yeah, I just took a quick look before we started recording the show. The price to book was like 28X, and the price to sales is 33X on future. It's definitely not a cheap stock. That being said, the valuation could get brought in check if the growth happens more quickly than the estimates go up. I went on looked at the average analyst estimates over the last 90 days. $1.89 per share in earnings expected in 2019. That's up from $1.43 90 days ago. That's a pretty significant increase in the past 90 days.\nJones: Absolutely. So, yes, definitely a stock to watch. All the stocks we've talked about today, so many interesting things happening, so many novel disease targets and indications. Certainly be sure to add them to your watch list.\nFor us, that is it for this week's Industry Focus: Healthcare show.

{{Healthcare industry stalwart Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported its Q3 earnings last week, and others in the Big Pharma sector will report soon -- and anyone who owns stock in them should pay attention for clues as to what their companies may discuss on their calls. Here are three things you should be ready to hear about when other stocks report.\nEmerging markets are brutal\nAnyone who's been watching the stock market over the past couple of months knows that growth in emerging economies is slowing. But a strong dollar is what's really going to hurt drug companies with big international sales, at least in the short term. Johnson & Johnson reported that revenue was up 0.8% operationally year over year in the third quarter, but that currency exchange had a whopping 8.2% negative impact on sales. That's rough, and it does not bode well for pharmas with big international exposure. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), for example, received 57.9% of its revenue from countries outside of the United States last quarter.\nThe pain looks likely to continue, at least for now, but it's the cost of doing business. After all, the U.S. is a fairly saturated market, and Europe is likely to continue controlling costs. That means the big growth opportunities are, well, elsewhere. So, even though it weighs on revenue and profitability now, it's a good move for companies to continue driving into emerging markets.\nAnticoagulant sales could slow over the short term\nFactor Xa inhibitors, a new class of anticoagulants that are forecasted to achieve multibillion peak annual sales, may have had a slightly tougher third quarter across the board. Johnson & Johnson reported -- without giving the precise sales figures -- that its anticoagulant Xarelto had sales slow during the quarter due to patients hitting the Medicare Part D donut hole (a gap in Medicare coverage you can read more about here). J&J CFO Dominic Caruso noted that the slowdown \"wouldn't be necessarily just for our product. It would be seen across other products as well\" (this and other quotes courtesy of S&P Capital IQ).\nThat means Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) may report a slowdown in sales for their competitor anticoagulant, Eliquis. So, if you're an investor in those companies and you're expecting incredible growth out of that particular drug, time to temper expectations for a quarter or two.\nLong term, this doesn't really matter. The donut hole is an outside issue, it's something that happens each year, and the Affordable Care Act is gradually reducing the coverage gap over the next several years. And Factor Xa inhibitors have a number of longer-term tailwinds. For one, Eliquis and Xarelto are still in growth mode, with analysts estimating peak sales around 2018 or 2020. Meanwhile, Portola Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PTLA) is developing a reversal agent that could actually increase demand for Xarelto and Eliquis over the long haul -- although Portola is also developing its own Factor Xa inhibitor, so there could be a thorn buried in that particular rose. Bottom line: The future looks bright for these drugs, so ignore the short-term numbers and focus on the growth story.\nMore deals incoming?\nJohnson & Johnson has $37 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. Execs were upfront with analysts on the call: They see deals (including potential mergers and acquisitions, or M&A) in the near future. Gary Pruden, Chairman of J&J's Global Surgery Group noted that \"accelerating our pace of tuck-in deals would be a good opportunity for Medical Device.\" While the picture wasn't as clear on the pharma side -- J&J has tended to avoid large pharma acquisitions, preferring license deals and bolt-ons -- the same narrative came through very clearly: Management is looking for deals to juice growth.\nWill other companies follow along? It's hard to say. Certainly American Big Pharma is sitting on a lot of cash (numbers from Q2, since the other big players haven't reported yet):\nBig Pharma Cash and Short-Term Investments Pfizer $30.3 billion Merck $11.4 billion Bristol-Myers Squibb $5.5 billion Eli Lilly $4.2 billion\nAnd after getting pounded over the last couple of months, biotech stocks are undeniably looking cheaper, meaning the opportunity to pick up companies on the cheap is undeniably present.\nFocus on what matters\nYou'll probably hear more about the three issues I've mentioned above on a number of upcoming quarterly calls. While it's important to understand what I've shared above, of the three issues mentioned, the one that matters most long term is the M&A discussion. The other issues are short term, and they shouldn't distract you from the potential for deals. After all, smart capital allocation has a habit of driving tremendous shareholder value.\n}}

{{Indianans fight to save the ACA. | facebook.com\/groups\/OurRevolutionIN3\/\nINDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2013 With a new Republican administration taking power, hundreds of Hoosiers, on the weekend honoring the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., packed the Indiana State House to defend healthcare. Working men and women, retirees, and youth from all over the state gathered with labor and community organizations to send a unified message to the new Senate and Congress that they do not repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nIndianapolis Our Revolution, along with Central Indiana Democratic Socialists of America, the Socialist Party USA, The Indiana Democratic Party, Black Lives Matter and Jobs with Justice members organized the local action as part of the nationwide Jan. 15 campaign to defend the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid in Indianapolis. This was a true grass-roots effort.\nRep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., spoke as did Sen. Joe Donnelly about the 300,000 Hoosiers who would lose health care under the state\u2019s Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) which gets all of its funding from the Affordable Care Act. Carson reminded everyone that people will die as a result of this callous act by Republicans.\nSen. Donnelly, who received $240,000 in donations from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, got heckled when he took the podium for refusing to back the Sanders-Warren amendment that would have allowed U.S. citizens to buy their prescriptions from Canada at a more affordable price.\nDominic Dorsey from Indianapolis D.O.N.T. S.L.E.E.P.\/Black Lives Matter reminded those in attendance that the repeal of ACA would have an even greater impact on African Americans. Dorsey stated that the GOP will have blood on its hands. He went on to provide statistics related to a racist, profit-driven health care system where the mortality rate for African Americans is about 967 per 100,000 as compared to 817 per 100,000 for white people. Mr. Dorsey also told the crowd that African American citizens are less likely to have health insurance due to lower wage jobs that do not provide such benefits.\nJanet Chilton, a cancer survivor, decried the repeal of the ACA as she recalled being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994 and how she was unable to find health coverage due to the pre-existing condition clause, which insurance companies will reinstate once ACA is repealed.\nVice president of the Indianapolis City-County Council, Zach Adamson, told the crowd that we need health care that puts patients first. Adamson decried Republicans in government who bemoaned the ACA while enjoying the benefits of comprehensive healthcare themselves.\nAudree Bee, another speaker, linked the struggle for healthcare to the fight for LGBTQ equality. \u201cWe need to fight tooth and nail for the most vulnerable among us for the next four years,\u201d she said, calling for universal single-payer healthcare.\nLastly, Emily Hernandez, a certified nursing assistant who works in home health and assisted living facilities laid out the possibility that the elderly may end up homeless if cuts to Medicaid and the replacement of Medicare with a voucher system become a reality.\nAs the rally came to a close, dozens of people were still lined up outside to get into the event. According to official counts by the Indiana State House security personnel, 962 people made it inside to the rally.\n}}

{{Virgin\u2019s rapid expansion into healthcare has seen it winning contracts for services from immunisation to sexual health\nHow Virgin became one of the UK's leading healthcare providers\nIn early 2000, the Labour government realised it had a problem with the NHS.\nAlan Milburn, the then health secretary, wanted fresh ideas to help make hospitals more patient-friendly \u2013 and he asked for them from a rather unusual place: Sir Richard Branson.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur knew nothing about medicine \u2013 but he could run businesses and had made stacks of money from them. His airline, Virgin Atlantic, had won awards for passenger care.\nVirgin awarded almost \u00a32bn of NHS contracts in the past five years Read more\nSo, over a three-month period, a team from Virgin, including the group\u2019s \u201cbrand quality director\u201d and a general manager from the airline, visited hospitals and GP surgeries around England and Wales.\nTheir conclusions were stark. In 31-page report \u2013 only released publicly following a freedom of information request in 2013 \u2013 they described tatty buildings, hospitals with skips in corridors and long waiting times.\nThey talked of people waiting for appointments, of unhappy staff and a lack of leadership, and recommended a raft of improvements, including a new type of \u201cpoly-clinic\u201d to take on some of the functions traditionally done by hospitals.\n\u201cThe NHS certainly needs to change,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd there is a strong appetite for change among the staff.\u201d\nAnd who should take on this challenge?\nEighteen years on, Virgin is in the hot seat. Branson\u2019s Virgin Care has won almost \u00a32bn worth of contracts since 2010 and at least one commissioning group is spending more than a fifth of its budget with the company.\nVirgin boasts of providing more than 400 services for more than 40 commissioning groups around the country, ranging from school immunisation services to sexual health services contracted by councils in the north-east.\nWith such a significant stake in the NHS, and such rapid growth in the sector, there is now increasing scrutiny of Virgin \u2013 and whether it can deliver what it said was needed all those years ago.\nThere are questions too for Branson \u2013 and why this most flamboyant of British entrepreneurs has quietly but determinedly turned to the public sector to make money \u2013 albeit in small amounts at the moment.\nAnd at the heart of the empire is Virgin Group Holdings Limited, a holding company based in the tax haven of the British Virgin Isles.\nIt is all a far cry from the mail order record business Branson began in 1970, having already failed in ventures to grow Christmas trees and sell budgerigars.\nSince then, all manner of businesses have come and gone \u2013 Virgin Cola went flat, his phones business was sold (though it still operates under the Virgin brand) and his health clubs are controlled by a South African private equity firm.\nVirgin Galactic is still intending to take passengers into space \u2013 propelled by money from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\nBack on terra firma, and in the UK, Branson has branched into the public sector.\nThe scale of this is set out in accounts for Virgin UK Holdings Limited \u2013 one of the main UK-based companies in his collection. They show that in 2016 rail and healthcare accounted for more than half of its \u00a31.5bn revenue.\nThe balance sheets record that revenue from healthcare reached \u00a3262m, while the company\u2019s share of the rail business it runs with StageCoach added \u00a3566m over the year. Brand licensing brought in \u00a358m, a hotels business added \u00a344m and management services collected another \u00a370m.\nThey are not the only Virgin companies with links to central or local government. Virgin Start Up, a wholly owned subsidiary, delivers services for the government\u2019s startup loan programme.\nIn the outer reaches of the empire, Virgin Active has a deal with a local council to run a swimming pool in west London.\nWhile much smaller than the likes of Capita or Carillion, Virgin Group is growing fast and has become a regular winner of state contracts in the health sector through a complex web of companies and subsidiaries.\nVirgin does not publicly disclose all its contracts \u2013 and in government, there does not appear to be any central register of what state money is going where.\nBut analysis by the Guardian suggests that the company has won contracts worth a potential \u00a31.8bn in just the past five years. These range from a \u00a3509,000 contract to run a GP\u2019s surgery in Bedfordshire for three years, to a \u00a3700m deal to look after more than 200 services in the west country for the next decade.\nThe NHS contracts are operated through two companies: Virgin Care Limited and Virgin Care Services Limited. In the year to March 2017, both reported losses, meaning there was no tax to pay on their revenues. If they make a profit in future, it will be liable to UK tax.\nBeneath them is a web of companies that hold different elements of the group \u2013 and money is transferred between them.\nFor example, contracts to run several GP surgeries in Coventry are owned through Virgin Care Coventry LLP. They pass on profits to the parent companies and pay an annual management charge to Virgin Care Limited.\nSome of this complexity is a legacy of Virgin\u2019s route into the NHS which began inauspiciously in 2008 when it announced, and then ditched, plans to open a first polyclinic in Swindon. Two years later, it bought a controlling stake in a company called Assura Medical which already provided services to 30 GP practices.\nVirgin has bought into, or bought out, other companies, too. But the complexity of the healthcare arm is also in keeping with the way the Virgin group is structured, with myriad companies which own bits of each other.\nEven two decades ago it was incredibly complicated, recalls one former employee. One of her jobs involved regularly updating a chart showing the group\u2019s many subsidiaries.\n\u201cI had to manage the enormous company structure diagram which was the size of a dinner table,\u201d she says. \u201cIt looked like an enormous family tree. I had to move things around, change names.\u201d\nThis labyrinthine structure makes it difficult to work out which elements of the business are profitable and where any eventual profits end up.\nMoney from some of the UK-based businesses heads to the British Virgin Islands, where Branson lives as a tax exile.\nAs companies based there can avoid scrutiny as well as tax, the true value of the Virgin Group Holdings Limited is a mystery.\nIn January, in a blog on his website, Branson pledged not to make a profit out of the NHS work: \u201cIf and when I could take a dividend from Virgin Care (which would make us a profit over and above our overall investment), I will invest 100% of that money back into helping NHS patients young and old, with our frontline employees deciding how best to spend it.\u201d\nVirgin Care told the Guardian that this commitment to reinvest profits had been signed up to by the relevant company boards.\nHowever, campaigners are sceptical about the company\u2019s motives. Paul Evans, the director of the pressure group NHS Support Federation, said: \u201cVirgin Care is clearly not a charity or a not-for-profit company.\n\u201cClaims that the company is not motivated by financial reward would be more credible if Virgin Care weren\u2019t woven into a web of private companies that connect upwards to the Virgin Islands tax haven.\u201d\nAnother concern raised by critics of the NHS\u2019s use of private providers is that they can just hand back contracts when things are not going their way. Asked if the recent premature ending of the Virgin Trains contract to run the east coast mainline suggested this could be a concern, Virgin told the Guardian: \u201cVirgin Trains East Coast has no bearing on Virgin Care.\u201d\nThere have been problems with some of the contracts. In June, Lancashire county council\u2019s attempt to award a \u00a3104m contract to Virgin was blocked by a legal challenge. And last year, Virgin won a \u00a32m payout from NHS trusts after taking court action over the loss of a children\u2019s services contract in Surrey.\nMeanwhile, East Staffordshire clinical commissioning group is in a long-running contractual dispute with Virgin over a \u00a339m-a-year deal to run care for the longterm sick and elderly.\nAnd though, as a whole, Virgin has been rated well by the Care Quality Commission, some individual services have been panned. Forexample, the CQC report on Sutherland Lodge Surgery in Essex, was judged to be outstanding before Virgin took over following the resignation of the previous owners.\nFollowing an inspection in late 2017, the surgery was put into special measures, with the CQC raising concerns about a range of issues, from drugs kept at the wrong temperature, to important letters from hospitals being missed for weeks.\n\u201cThe practice had no clear leadership structure, insufficient leadership capacity and limited formal governance arrangements,\u201d inspectors found. A follow-up inspection in January found some improvement, but still rated the services as \u201cinadequate\u201d.\nCarol Sams, who ran the practice for almost 20 years, told the Guardian that details of payments she had seen suggested Virgin was being paid more for offering a more basic service to patients. \u201cThey were getting 30% more than we had been getting. They were only offering core services, but they were being paid more,\u201d she said.\nVirgin Group told the Guardian the \u00a31.8bn figure for contracts \u201crepresent the advertised value not the actual value of the contract and assume that all potential extensions are taken up\u201d.\nA spokesman said: \u201cVirgin Care has not made a profit to date and the Virgin Group has invested millions in Virgin Care \u2013 improving patient and employee satisfaction and saving the NHS and local authorities millions.\n\u201cRichard and his team want to help the NHS the best way they can and, in January 2018, Richard pledged that if and when he could take a dividend (over and above his interest-free investment) he will put 100% of that money back into the NHS, with frontline employees deciding how best to spend it. This was a public commitment by Richard and the relevant boards have committed to it also.\u201d\nWith regards to Sutherland Lodge, Virgin Care said it was not privy to details of the previous provider\u2019s contract: \u201cFollowing the CQC\u2019s inspection in December last year we immediately took further action. When inspectors came back just three weeks later, the significant improvements we had made were noted.\n\u201cWe welcomed inspectors back on 4 July and they were very positive at the further progress we\u2019d made since January in implementing our improvement plan, and gave us positive feedback about the improvements to the practice. We are awaiting the publication of an updated report in the coming months which will reflect this most recent visit.\nThis article was amended on 9 August 2018 to clarify that Virgin sold its phones business but that it is still operated under the Virgin brand.\n}}

{{Though India officially calls healthcare a right for all citizens, doctor and staff absenteeism from public medical facilities prevents many citizens from accessing their legally-entitled care.\nNow, one non-profit has created a system that uses mobile phones to check up on healthcare workers' attendance.\nThe Indo-Deutch Project Management Society (IDPMS) tracks SMS messages reporting staff absences sent by local patients, and maps the regions and facilities where absenteeism is prevalent. These maps are then made available to locals and policymakers.\n\"Technology presents great potential to influence the flow of information,\" says Oscar Abello, senior program associate at the Results for Development Institute, which created the IDPMS video. \"Information used to be spread by the country or the state. People can now start from the ground level to create a feedback loop, so the government can finally be held accountable.\"\nIDPMS works in southern India's state of Karnataka, and focuses on bringing accountability to rural services provided by the government. The organization found rural villagers deprived of health services, reporting that doctors only showed up to the public health centers two or three days each week.\nDespite their jobs requiring five and a half days of weekly attendance and full time on-call availability, the IDPMS study found doctors available for only four hours per day and entirely unavailable for 100 days each year. As a result, many impoverished Indians turn to expensive services at private hospitals.\nSEE ALSO: Mobile Phones Cut Malaria Response Time From Weeks to Minutes\nThe IDPMS finds the reason for doctor absenteeism to be a complete lack of accountability checks at the local level. Doctors are paid regardless of their attendance, because record keeping is known to be unreliable. This new mobile system, the organization believes, can bring about change thanks to its integration of ordinary citizens into the healthcare system.\n\"We want local organizations to be the ones creating these accountability programs, because they're the only ones capable of creating sustainable change and they have the capability of applying those skills to other prominent issues,\" Abello says. \"This way, local groups are known as the problem solvers in their own countries.\"\nHow do you see mobile technology impacting the developing world?

The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.\u201d\nAmazon.com\u2019s reputation as a disruptor prompted investors in January, when the venture was announced, to sell shares of companies that might be hurt.\nThese included drugmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts Holding Co.\nBuffett said the goal was to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments.\nYet Charlie Munger, Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, suggested that Democrats could take over Congress after November\u2019s elections and push for a national healthcare system financed by a single payer. Munger predicted that such a change would harm drug benefit managers.\n\u201cI suspect that eventually, when Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, that we will get single-payer medical care, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much more friendly than any of the PBMs,\u201d Munger said.\nBuffett, famed for his love of junk food, has said spiralling healthcare costs are responsible for 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, up from 5 percent in 1960, and he wants to slash a few percentage points off.\n\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Buffett said.\nTodd Combs, one of Buffett\u2019s investment deputies and a JPMorgan director, is working on the joint venture with Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan, and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.com.\n\u201cWe want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to give it a shot. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n}}

{{Still smarting over its failed $843 million bid to buy the Daughters of Charity Health System, a Southern California hospital company this week sued California Attorney General Kamala Harris, alleging she abused her constitutional powers by imposing unprecedented conditions on the sale and placing the interests of a labor union over the health care needs of communities across the state.\nPrime Healthcare Services, which filed the suit Monday in federal court in Riverside, called the legal action \u201ca sweeping indictment of governmental overreach and the California regulatory system and the unlawful influence of the Service Employees International Union \u2014 United Healthcare Workers West.\u201d\nIn February, Harris imposed what many say was a deal-killer for Ontario-based Prime \u2014 a requirement to keep the struggling hospitals open for at least 10 years, which is twice the normal amount of time in such deals. The company committed to five years. Harris has yet to rule on the latest deal in the works from a New York City-based hedge fund that has also proposed keeping the hospitals open five years.\nThe controversy over the Prime deal has played out for two years while concerns grow over the fate of the Los Altos Hills-based safety-net hospital system that includes O\u2019Connor Hospital in San Jose, Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy, Seton Medical Center in Daly City and Seton Coastside Hospital in Moss Beach, as well as two hospitals in Los Angeles.\nHarris \u2014 who by law must approve all nonprofit hospital sales in California \u2014 is named as defendant in the suit, which calls for a jury trial and award of damages related to its allegations that Harris violated Prime\u2019s due process and equal protection rights under federal and state law.\nPrime said it is not asking for another chance to consummate the deal but is asking that the court bar Harris from reviewing future nonprofit hospital sales.\n\u201cPrime has been treated differently and unfairly in that Attorney General Harris is a shill for UHW,\u201d said Troy Schell, the company\u2019s general counsel.\nHarris\u2019 office issued a brief statement Monday saying: \u201cPrime\u2019s decision to walk away, and this lawsuit, reaffirms the concerns voiced at multiple community meetings that Prime never intended to prioritize the continuity of vital health services.\u201d\nMoreover, her office repeated that Prime had publicly stated \u201cthat it had no issue with the 10-year conditions and intended not to close any of the hospitals or end essential services.\u201d\nDave Regan, president of the SEIU-UHW, also denounced Prime\u2019s action, saying Monday that Prime \u201cuses lawsuits as a way to silence opponents and evade accountability for their terrible record on patient safety, Medicare billing and workers rights.\u201d\nHe said Prime has now filed \u201cmeritless lawsuits\u201d against the California Attorney General and the U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services, among government offices.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who they will sue next,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cbut the Pope also had to approve the sale, so if I were him, I\u2019d watch my back.\u201d\nDaughters of Charity had no comment.\nIn its lawsuit, Prime claims that both before and after the company\u2019s bid was announced last October, Daughters\u2019 executives had told Prime that Harris would deny the sale \u201cor require financially crippling approval conditions\u201d if Prime did not reach an agreement with United Healthcare Workers West.\nDaughters, the lawsuit said, made clear to Prime that UHW was the \u201cKingmaker\u201d with respect to Harris\u2019 approval of the sale.\nThe lawsuit also said that in July 2014, Regan told Prime Chairman Dr. Prem Reddy that Regan would prevent the sale unless Prime allowed UHW to unionize hospital workers at all of Prime\u2019s hospitals. Prime refused.\nHarris imposed 12 key conditions on Prime before clearing the way for a sale: Particularly onerous to the Southern California for-profit hospital chain was a requirement to keep most of the facilities open as acute care hospitals for 10 years, instead of five years. As a result, Prime said it was forced to withdraw its purchase offer in March.\nIn July, Daughters announced it had selected New York City-based hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management as its new investor, with an option to buy the nonprofit hospital chain in three years.\nBut documents show that BlueMountain Capital, like Prime before it, is guaranteeing to keep the hospitals open for five years.\nThe 62-page lawsuit accuses Harris of being the puppet of the SEIU-UHW, which for years has accused Prime of cutting services to patients and lowering pay and benefits for hospital workers. Critics have accused Harris, a labor-backed Democrat, of bowing to union pressure because she is counting on union support in her run for Barbara Boxer\u2019s U.S. Senate seat.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the SEIU-UHW promised to support Harris by using up to $25 million in political contributions through an independent expenditure fund if she denied the Daughters of Charity-Prime sale or imposed deal-killing conditions.\nPrime\u2019s bid was largely supported by the public, physicians and nurses \u2014 including the California Nurses Association. But SEIU-UHW adamantly opposed the sale.\n}}

{{It\u2019s astonishing to find technologically advanced industries still struggling with the age-old problem of paper records and disconnected systems. Take the healthcare industry, which has made robotic surgery possible and now is on the verge of releasing nanobots into our bloodstreams. Yet on the backend, healthcare professionals and patients still resubmit the same forms over and over because of a lack of integration across systems and devices. This increases the risk for errors and, in turn, can jeopardize the health of individuals.\nToday, the biggest revolutions in healthcare technology aren\u2019t just occurring on the frontend, but also in getting existing technology on the backend to open up and connect with new technologies. With the explosion of data from mobile and wearable devices, healthcare organizations now need to efficiently and accurately treat patients by connecting with external third-party applications, devices and services for a complete picture of the patient\u2019s health.\nIn essence, connectivity is the new way forward in healthcare, and APIs are the invisible integrators making this possible.\nThe New Way Forward\nMany organizations and hospitals are cautious of sharing private information that could contain personal, financial and medical data from consumers and patients. Technology innovation in the healthcare industry has historically been hindered by these proprietary concerns over data. In addition, Ponemon Institute estimates 91 percent of healthcare organizations have suffered at least one data breach in the last two years, creating heightened security concerns. Vendors that gather health data are often reluctant to integrate or share electronic health records (EHR) with others for this reason, locking valuable health data in silos and keeping it outside of hospitals.\nHowever, when data isn\u2019t shared with a patient\u2019s care providers and isn\u2019t integrated across systems within the healthcare organization, it fails to provide the full picture of a patient\u2019s health, hindering overall care. For this reason, the industry is gravitating to APIs, which allow disparate systems and data to talk to one another without impacting the underlying data or compromising IT governance and security. This creates a seamless, reusable flow of information between internal systems and those belonging to third parties.\nOne of the biggest mistakes a healthcare organization can make is keeping data from mobile, wearable and cloud sources in silos.\nOne company solving these integration issues is Validic, a cloud-based, digital-health platform that uses a RESTful API to provide easy access to patient data from in-home clinical devices, wearables and healthcare applications. Using its RESTful API, Validic is opening up critical information by connecting patient-recorded data with hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies and more. Validic addresses security and privacy concerns by being HIPAA-compliant, managing private data centers and achieving U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d standards to ensure personal data is transferred safely.\nAdditionally, HealthCare.gov, a federal government website managed by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, allows outside developers to embed content from its website through an API. This approach promotes not only greater access to information (promoting transparency and accountability), but also allows others to extend and leverage that data in their own applications.\nA Ripe Market\nAs Apple Watch, Android Wear, Google Glass and Fitbit, among other wearable technology, continue to gain popularity, consumers are putting increasing pressure on healthcare IT vendors and hospitals to allow their health data from personal tracking devices to be shared in real time with their doctors. Therefore, healthcare companies will benefit from integrating these devices into their overall network infrastructure to allow for greater connectivity and information sharing.\nIn addition, consumers are demanding their medical history be automatically shared with new healthcare providers to reduce the paperwork required with each hospital visit and to ensure all relevant data is accounted for. One of the biggest mistakes a healthcare organization can make is keeping data from mobile, wearable and cloud sources in silos. By allowing the free flow of data across clinical and non-clinical systems and across legacy, cloud, mobile and personal device platforms, hospitals are able to not only improve current patient-care practices, but also innovate and find new ways to enhance the care experience.\nThe healthcare industry is at the forefront of creating new technology to treat patients. Yet, there is still a dichotomy in that the healthcare industry is also far behind the curve in regards to IT innovation. Many healthcare organizations are still stifled by paper records and old, disconnected systems on the backend. It\u2019s time to change that, and APIs are a way to automate processes and allow healthcare professionals to spend more time focusing on what really matters: treating patients and improving lives.\n}}

{{Welcome to 2017, where the American government has ceded its already crumbling moral authority to the former host of The Man Show.\nDon't you miss the 2016 election now?\nStill, the last few days have produced some of the best material late night television has ever had to offer, and all it's because of former Man Show star, Win Ben Stein's Money co-host, and late night host, Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel has not only taken on the Senate's practically homicidal Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill, he's done it without resorting to lies or distortions (how quaint!). He accomplished this by speaking from a place of deep empathy, and by centering on a character that remains untouchable across the political spectrum: his baby.\nBack in May, Kimmel's newborn son had to undergo an emergency open-heart surgery. It was this hardship that brought America's perilous healthcare situation into sharp focus for the comedian. And as he's grown more vocal about the issue, he returns to his own child as the impetus for his outspokenness.\nThat's why every counter-attack by GOP politician and pundits against Kimmel has fallen flat on its face: in the symbolic war between sick babies and man-baby Senators, the sick baby will always win.\nBy positioning his baby at his monologue's heart and center, he's created the most sympathetic protagonist imaginable and made anyone who opposes that character a hateful antagonist by extension (which, I mean, is accurate). Everyone who attacks Kimmel's position, is essentially attacking his baby.\nNot a good position for a politician.\n\"Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there\u2019s a good chance you would never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition,\" Kimmel said in May. \u201cIf your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make ... we all agree on that, right? I mean, we do!\u201d\nBabies work. There's a reason why every politician is required to take a photo with them at some point in their campaign.\nWhen I was a social worker, we talked a lot about \"worthy victims\" and \"unworthy victims.\" \"Unworthy victims\" are people a society has collectively decided are victims because of their own poor choices: the poor, victims of sexual assault, the homeless, welfare recipients, people of color, criminals and undocumented immigrants. \"Worthy victims,\" by contrast, are folks that society has deemed sufficiently worthy of empathy (and consequently, of charitable donations) including sick children, the elderly and people with *certain* disabilities.\nThat doesn't mean that worthy victims are exactly living large in America. Just think of the folks who were cruelly pulled from their wheelchairs by Capitol police while protesting Trumpcare that summer. But it does mean that they, culturally at least, have tremendous worth. I can't think of a stronger symbolic lead than Kimmel's son \u2014 a sick, wealthy kind with a devastating illness \u2014 followed closely by his acerbic father. Is there anything Americans love more than a cynical man, who simultaneously knows his facts and is deeply in touch with his own tenderness?\nOf a Fox and Friends host who attacked Kimmel for his monologues, Kimmel had this to say:\n\"And you know, the reason I\u2019m talking about this is because my son had an open-heart surgery and has to have two more, and because of that, I\u2019ve learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cI don\u2019t get anything out of this, Brian [Kilmeade], you phony little creep. Oh, I\u2019ll pound you when I see you.\"\nJust look at how these Republican politicians and pundits tiptoed around his attacks, especially as they relate to Kimmy's son, and relied on the tired excuse than Kimmel wasn't smart enough to analyze the bill because's he's a late night comedian.\n.@kilmeade responds to late night host Jimmy Kimmel pic.twitter.com\/G9jEiFH1Mk \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) September 21, 2017\nBill Cassidy says Jimmy Kimmel \"doesn't understand\" health care. Experts say otherwise. https:\/\/t.co\/uTy7OoNEQL pic.twitter.com\/DanXQywPjN \u2014 HuffPost (@HuffPost) September 21, 2017\nRemember: these folks voted for a man who recently made up an African country in front of Africans and didn't realize that Frederick Douglass was dead, so we're not exactly dealing with \"wonks\" here.\nAll late night comedians have in some ways impacted culture and by extension, politics, but Kimmel might become the first late night politicians to have an immediate, substantive impact on policy. There's a Jimmy Kimmel test Senator Cassidy once told Congress it has to pass. Kimmel even ended his monologue with a screen full of Senator's phone numbers, amplifying his personal story and turning it into collective action.\nBabies work. There's a reason why every politician is required to take a photo with them at some point in their campaign. There's a reason why political ads that include children, like this one of Hillary's, are far more effective than those that feature rehabilitated criminal \u2014 even though both would be endangered by Graham-Cassidy. Kimmel even admitted that he was \"politicizing his baby\" for the greater good.\nDoing anything that might directly harm babies is one the last moral lines we have around these broken parts. Let's see if one man's 13-minute monologues are powerful enough to keep us from crossing it.\n}}

{{Paul Ryan tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s time we stand up for our children and end this brutal gang violence occurring in our neighborhoods, once and for all.\" Photo: Getty Images\nIn their seemingly quixotic effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, House Republicans were third time lucky. The latest version of their American Health Care Act squeaked by in the House 217 to 213, although no one knows how much it will cost or how many people it would cover.\nTwo previous versions of the American Health Care Act were pulled from the floor of the House after it became clear the Republicans didn't have enough votes to pass it. Democrats were united in opposition, and conservative and moderate Republicans split over whether the bill went too far or not far enough and sank the vote. This time, a compromise on requiring coverage for people with pre-existing conditions brought together those factions (but without enticing Democrats).\nWhat happens now:\n\u2014 Obamacare remains in place for the moment.\n\u2014 The bill heads to the Senate, where it is ultimately not expected to pass. One Republican senator put the chances at less than 20 percent in the bill's current form.\n\u2014 Republican senators plan to use a process called budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster and pass the AHCA with only 51 votes. Democrats argue that what the bill does goes beyond what is allowed in budget reconciliation \u2014 a total connection to taxes or spending \u2014 and deserves a full vote that subjects it to the filibuster. They will likely win that argument: Even Senate Leader Mitch McConnell says it'll be \"a real tough challenge on the Senate side.\"\n\u2014 Even if the bill is substantially changed enough to gain Democratic support in the Senate, the House is not expected to approve those changes.\n\u2014 The bill did not receive a CBO (Congressional Budget Office) score, so it is unknown how much the plan will cost or how many people will lose health insurance were it to be enacted. That score is expected soon, but not this week. (The CBO estimated that the original version of the AHCA would have removed 24 million people from the insurance rolls and caused health-insurance premiums to rise 15 to 20 percent.)\n\u2014 Democrats will continue to be dismayed. \"TrumpCare spells heart-stopping premium increases for Americans with anything from asthma to cancer,\" House leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement yesterday. \"But tomorrow, House Republicans are going to tattoo this moral monstrosity to their foreheads, and the American people will hold them accountable.\"\n}}

The company declared and paid daily distributions equal to $0.60 per share annualized to its stockholders of record for the second quarter 2018, equal to an annualized distribution rate of 6.0 percent for Class T stockholders and 6.51 percent for Class I stockholders, assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share for Class T shares and $9.21 per share for Class I shares. The annualized distribution rate is equal to 5.97 percent for Class T stockholders and 6.22 percent for Class I stockholders who purchased their shares subsequent to April 9, 2018 , when share purchase prices for investors were adjusted to $10.05 per share for Class T shares and $9.65 per share for Class I shares. Share prices were adjusted following the approval by the company's board of directors of an estimated per share net asset value of its common stock of $9.65 as of Dec. 31, 2017 .5\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to the close of the second quarter 2018, the company completed property acquisitions totaling approximately $90.2 million , comprised of three medical office buildings and two senior housing-RIDEA facilities. As of Aug. 14, 2018 , the company's portfolio consisted of 50 medical office buildings, senior housing facilities and skilled nursing facilities located in 20 states comprised of approximately 3.0 million square feet of gross leasable area, acquired for an aggregate contract purchase price of approximately $626.3 million . Additionally, the company is currently pursuing approximately $404.7 million in additional pending acquisitions,2 which would result in a total portfolio of approximately 98 healthcare buildings located in 22 states comprised of approximately 4.7 million square feet of gross leasable area upon the successful completion of these potential acquisitions.\n1 Based on aggregate contract purchase price as of Aug. 14, 2018 . 2 Comprised of prospective real estate acquisitions for which the company has executed letters of intent and\/or purchase and sale agreements as of Aug. 9, 2018 . These prospective acquisitions are subject to substantial closing conditions and the satisfaction of other requirements as detailed in the agreements. Accordingly, the closing of some or all of these pending transactions may not occur. 3 The operation of healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 is commonly referred to as a \"RIDEA\" structure. 4 Total debt divided by total market value of real estate. Total market value equals the aggregate contract purchase price paid for investments or, for investments appraised subsequent to the date of purchase, the aggregate value reported in the most recent independent appraisals of such investments. 5 Please refer to the company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 9, 2018 for additional information.\nFINANCIAL TABLES AND NOTES FOLLOW\nGRIFFIN-AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT IV, INC.

Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore, if there is no further cash on hand to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment, operations and non-operating expenses would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP, such as expenses incurred in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss), which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.\nNet operating income is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, net operating income is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Net operating income should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. Investors are also cautioned that net operating income should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any acquisition related expenses.\nWe believe that net operating income is an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of our operating assets because net operating income excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of the properties. We believe that net operating income is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term net operating income may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nTo facilitate understanding of this financial measure, the following is a reconciliation of net (loss) income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to net operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended June 30 , 2018 2017 Net (loss) income $ (958,000) $ 621,000 General and administrative 1,578,000 952,000 Acquisition related expenses 61,000 140,000 Depreciation and amortization 7,851,000 2,466,000 Interest expense 1,160,000 409,000 Interest income \u2014 (1,000) Net operating income $ 9,692,000 $ 4,587,000\nGRIFFIN-AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT IV, INC.\nFFO AND MFFO RECONCILIATION\nFor the Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, a non-GAAP measure, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a real estate investment trust, or REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 , or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which is the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and\/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. In addition, we believe it is appropriate to exclude impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over time. Testing for an impairment of an asset is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. If certain impairment indications exist in an asset, and if the asset's carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset, an impairment charge would be recognized. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property.\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).\nHowever, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed as operating expenses under GAAP. We believe these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental performance measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs, and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes expensed acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities, as well as other non-operating items included in FFO, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our property acquisition activity ceases. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our property acquisition activity ceases with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our property acquisition activity ceases, as it excludes expensed acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010 . The Practice Guideline defines modified funds from operations as funds from operations further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect modified funds from operations on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income (loss) in calculating cash flows from operations and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, and we do not rely on another party to manage such risk. In as much as interest rate hedges will not be a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are based on market fluctuations and may not be directly related or attributable to our operations.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above- and below-market leases, change in deferred rent and the adjustments of such items related to redeemable noncontrolling interests. The other adjustments included in the IPA's Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there is no further cash on hand to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP, such as expenses incurred in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss), which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the future, we may pay acquisition fees or reimburse acquisition expenses due to our advisor and its affiliates, or a portion thereof, with net proceeds from borrowed funds, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nFurther, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operations. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence, that the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and modified funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the capital formation and acquisition stages are complete. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO.\nNeither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission , or SEC , NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC , NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net (loss) income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended June 30 , 2018 2017 Net (loss) income $ (958,000) $ 621,000 Add: Depreciation and amortization \u2014 consolidated properties 7,851,000 2,466,000 Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 58,000 \u2014 Less: Depreciation and amortization related to redeemable noncontrolling interests (70,000) \u2014 FFO attributable to controlling interest $ 6,881,000 $ 3,087,000 Acquisition related expenses(1) $ 61,000 $ 140,000 Amortization of above- and below-market leases(2) (81,000) (35,000) Change in deferred rent(3) (703,000) (282,000) Adjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests(4) \u2014 \u2014 MFFO attributable to controlling interest $ 6,158,000 $ 2,910,000 Weighted average Class T and Class I common shares outstanding \u2014 basic and diluted 51,277,753 24,035,973 Net (loss) income per Class T and Class I common share \u2014 basic and diluted $ (0.02) $ 0.03 FFO attributable to controlling interest per Class T and Class I common share \u2014 basic and diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.13 MFFO attributable to controlling interest per Class T and Class I common share \u2014 basic and diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.12\n(1) In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered, non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP, such as expenses incurred in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss), which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. (2) Under GAAP, above- and below-market leases are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate-related assets that are excluded from FFO. However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, we believe that by excluding charges relating to the amortization of above- and below-market leases, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. (3) Under GAAP, rental revenue or rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease (including rent holidays). This may result in income or expense recognition that is significantly different than the underlying contract terms. By adjusting for the change in deferred rent, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms, providing insight on the expected contractual cash flows of such lease terms, and aligns results with our analysis of operating performance. (4) Includes all adjustments to eliminate the redeemable noncontrolling interests' share of the adjustments described in notes (1) \u2013 (3) above to convert our FFO to MFFO.\nAbout Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc.\nGriffin-American Healthcare REIT IV intends to build a balanced and diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities.

{{cleveland clinic abu dhabi hospital exterior 3.jpg\nCleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, currently under construction, is expected to be completed in April 2014.\n(Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi)\nCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 Cleveland Clinic officials have great optimism for a new hospital in Abu Dhabi, saying it will provide not only new healthcare opportunities for residents of United Arab Emirates but a also for Clinic employees and also Cleveland itself.\n\"We're looking to have a mission to make a difference,\" said Marc Harrison, CEO of Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. \"It's a great opportunity to project American values in a tough neighborhood that's very positive.\"\nAbu Dhabi coverage\nClinic CEO Toby Cosgrove says the health system must lead the nation in healthcare reform: State of the Clinic\nClinic CEO Cosgrove targets mergers, acquisitions for growth\nDr. Marc Harrison named CEO for Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi\nCleveland Clinic offering sweet incentives to entice staff for new Abu Dhabi\nCleveland Clinic has its eyes on a global brand\nClinic to take over Abu Dhabi facilities\nLivestream video of construction in Abu Dhabi\nHarrison was one of several Clinic officials to speak during Abu Dhabi Night at the InterContinental Hotel Bank of America Conference Center. Also talking about the Clinics projects in Abu Dhabi were Clinic CEO and President Toby Cosgrove and several other speakers, including former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, chairman and CEO of the Cohen Group; Marc Choufani, senior vice president, Mubadala Healthcare; and Fred DeGrandis, interim CEO of Sheikh Khalifa Medical City.\nThe Cleveland Clinic currently has two hospital projects in the nation: Sheikh Khalifa Medical CitySheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC), managed by Cleveland Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, established through an agreement with Mubadala Healthcare, a business unit of Mubadala Development Co.\nSKMC consists of a 750-bed acute care hospital and 14 specialized outpatient clinics. Managed by the Clinic, SKMC is part of the SEHA HealthSystem and is owned and operated by Abu Dhabi Health Services Co. PJSC (SEHA), which is responsible for the curative activities of all public hospitals and clinics in Abu Dhabi.\nWhen it is completed in April 2014, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi will be a 2.6 million-square-foot multispecialty hospital and clinic rising on a 23-acre site on Sowwah Island in the United Arab Emirates. The Clinic says it is the largest and most complex hospital being built in the world.\nCleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi currently has close to 300 caregivers employed in Abu Dhabi. The hospital will be made up of approximately 170 consulting physicians and 1,500 nurses and allied health professionals. More than 30 medical and surgical specialties will be represented at the facility.\nCohen said employees from the United States should not be concerned about working in the UAE and that the nation is safe.\n\"You're probably as safe there as anywhere in the world,\" he said. Speakers also assured that women are treated with respect.\nRecruitment is under way to fill positions. A recruitment open house also was held on Monday. International recruiters answered questions about working and living in the city.\n\"It is unbelievable to me how hungry people around the world want to come and work at the Cleveland Clinic,\" Harrison said. \"It\u2019s the model of care that people find so attractive. ... There is no better place to be a physician, for example.\"\nAlready, Harrison said, 3,500 doctors from around the world have applied for 175 staff physician jobs in Abu Dhabi.\nAbu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, a small nation located on the Persian Gulf. It has a population of 2.12 million. UAE has a population of just over 8.2 million people.\n}}

{{Early in my spiritual healing practice I went to visit a homeless man who was living temporarily in a motel. He was suffering from extreme mental distress and intense fear. I talked to him for a while, sharing ideas I hoped would calm and comfort him, but he only became irrationally angry with me, and as I got in the car to leave, he slammed the car door on my leg.\nAs he pushed and pushed, he said, \u201cI am going to push this door until I break your leg.\u201d I was just quiet. Soon, he let go. I got out of the car and sat down in the parking lot with him and he talked for over an hour. I listened, and we prayed together. He quieted down, and stated he needed someone to listen to him and pray with him. He was much better when I left. Shortly after that, he found an apartment he could afford and lived there happily for quite a while. From that experience, I learned the importance of compassion in helping others.\nCompassion was the theme of this year\u2019s \u201cCaring for the Human Spirit\u201d Conference in Chicago. Sponsored by the HealthCare Chaplaincy Network, this year\u2019s speakers focused on the important role compassion plays in patient care. Held at the Sheraton Grand Hotel, the conference was attended by 300 hospital and hospice chaplains, nurses and social workers, and via video conferencing by professionals from all over the world \u2013 from the Netherlands and Germany to Ethiopia and Kenya.\nAccording to the HealthCare Chaplaincy Network, 87% of patients call spirituality important in their lives and according to one survey, 72% of patients articulated that they received minimal or no spiritual support from the medical team. To remedy this, Dr. Harold Koenig, M.D. of Duke University contends that patients need spiritual care generalists \u2013 physicians, nurses, social workers, etc, and spiritual care specialists \u2013 board certified chaplains (those who have completed a Master\u2019s degree in Divinity or its equivalent in an area relevant to professional chaplaincy).\nAccording to HCCN, \u201cBoard-certified chaplains seek to provide spiritual care to patients of all faith traditions and none. An explicit ethic of professional chaplaincy is that the board-certified chaplain seeks to connect the patient, family or staff person to their spiritual frame of reference, not superimpose or proselytize any specific religious or spiritual tradition.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s conference speakers emphasized compassion and its great value in ministering to hospice and hospital patients. Several speakers defined compassion as the capacity not only to attend to the experience of others, but to be of service. Shane Sinclair, PhD, spiritual care coordinator at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre, at the University of Calgary said, \u201cCompassion is a verb \u2013 trying to understand another and accordingly act.\u201d\nHe also noted benefits to the one expressing compassion. He said, \u201cWhen you help other people, you help yourself. There is very little evidence that you can run out of compassion.\u201d Keynote speaker and Buddhist teacher Roshi Joan Jiko Halifax, agreed. A pioneer in the field of end-of-life care, Halifax said, \u201cFatigue comes from distraction; attention gives us power and rest.\u201d Various speakers emphasized that occupational burn-out can be overturned by compassionate engagement with patients and their families.\nBoth Sinclair and Halifax remarked that listening to the patient is vital in compassionate care. They, as well as other speakers, remarked that patients did not want pity-based sympathy \u2013 that pity brought them down. Instead, what they wanted was someone who would actually listen to their fears, concerns and emotional pain to be with them during this time.\nSelf-care of professional caregivers, including chaplains, nurses and social workers, was addressed in break-out sessions. While it was acknowledged that hospice and hospital service can be hard work, Debra Mattison, clinical assistant professor in the school of social work at University of Michigan stated, \u201cInstead of saying our work is hard work, which it is, know that it is holy work.\u201d She remarked that it is important for chaplains and social workers, as well as nurses to see how empowering their work is to themselves and others. Many in the group nodded their heads in agreement.\nParticipants told me how they found compassion to be stress-busting \u2013 that their work is a spiritual journey with the patient and family; and that compassion naturally brings out a great sense of love, care, dignity and grace to their efforts that is felt by the patient and family members.\nMattison asked participants to fill in this blank: Would I want a (fill in your occupation) like me? For instance, would I want a chaplain, nurse or social worker like me? Hence, the importance of treating others as we would want to be treated.\nAfter attending this conference I was reminded of the phrase, \u201cA diamond is just a piece of charcoal that has handled stress exceptionally well.\u201d I was glad to meet these wonderful, dedicated chaplains, nurses and social workers \u2013 each one a sparkling example of Jesus\u2019 Golden Rule, \u201cAs ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so them.\u201d\n}}

{{The global consulting firm that just won a one-year government contract to continue fixing HealthCare.gov is a big political donor to President Obama, WND has learned.\nOn Friday it was reported Accenture, a global consulting firm, obtained the $45-million contract to run the Obamacare health insurance website. The company is taking over from CGI Federal, one of two contractors that originally built the problematic HealthCare.gov portal, with CGI\u2019s contract set to expire on Feb. 28.\nUnmentioned in the scores of news articles covering the successful Accenture bid is that Obama is the top all-time recipient of the firm\u2019s many financial contributions, with the president taking in a total of $286,168 from Accenture employees, family members and its political action committee.\nNo. 2 for Accenture\u2019s donations is former Republican New Jersey State Sen. Bob Martin, and No. 3 is former President George W. Bush at $164,250. Mitt Romney received $73,085 from Accenture. Hillary Clinton raked in $50,515 in contributions from the firm, with John Kerry accepting $45,853.\nObama has a further connection to Accenture. The chief scientist for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign\u2019s data analytics team, Rayid Ghani, worked at Accenture for 10 years before leaving the firm to take up the position with the president\u2019s reelection team.\nThe Obamacare website is not the first public contract awarded to Accenture. In 2011, the firm won a $85-million contract for Kansas\u2019 healthcare database, the funding for which came mostly from the federal government.\nAccenture previously was incorporated in America but then reportedly moved to the tax haven of Bermuda. The firm is currently incorporated in Dublin, Ireland, even though its operational headquarters are in Chicago.\nWith research by Brenda J. Elliott\n}}

{{The use of AI, or artificial intelligence, in the medical field is an\nemerging trend that promises exponential advances in the way we\ndiagnose and treat a multitude of health conditions. Advances in the\napplication of medical AI technology are occurring at a lightning pace,\nwith new developments rendering prior solutions obsolete in a matter\nof months.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll review some of the ways that AI technology is\nmaking the healthcare field more efficient, improving the quality of\ncare, raising ethical concerns, and offering medical practices a\ncompetitive advantage.\nHistory of AI in Healthcare\nAs early as 1959, the medical research field has been fascinated with\nthe potential for the application of artificial intelligence. Early\nresearchers envisioned a machine that could hold a vast amount of\nmedical knowledge and possess the ability to provide potential\ndiagnoses. In the early 1980s, the emerging field of Artificial\nIntelligence in Medicine (AIM) was urged on by advancements in the\nstorage and processing power of digital technology. Research\nconducted at Rutgers, Stanford, and MIT paved the way for today\u2019s\nextensive use of AI in medicine.\nPredictive Diagnoses\nThe use of AI allows medical teams to create diagnoses based on large\ndata sets. The various medical tests, and the data generated, can be\nextremely complicated and extensive. AI can analyze this data in\nseconds and observe statistical, as well as causal, relationships in the\ndata set. These correlations can be difficult or impossible for human\nresearchers and health professionals to identify. When the patient\u2019s\nmedical condition is precarious and requires urgent care, and accurate\ndiagnoses, AI can provide prompt prediction to aid in the practitioner\u2019s\nstrategy.\nPrecision Medicine\nPerhaps the most promising benefit of AI is precision, not only in the\nsense of making accurate prescriptions, but precision in terms of the\napplication of suggested medical treatments. AI has the capacity to\nutilize the patient\u2019s genetic profile to create recommendations that are\nunique to the person\u2019s code. AI systems can store and process an\nessentially limitless amount of data on medical conditions, patient\nhistories, case studies, and pharmaceutical compounds.\nAnother example of this precision is the use of AI driven robotic surgery\nequipment. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), developed by\nresearchers at the Sheikh Zayed Institute, has been proven more\naccurate in performing, and making real-time modifications to, planned\nsurgical procedures than human surgeons; however, the research cited\nthe need for human intervention in about 40% of the cases.\nAI can also make quick and accurate work of processing medical\nimagery. Software can identify almost imperceptible characteristics,\nhandle the tremendous amount of data generated by digital scanning\ntechnology, and decrease the analysis period from days to minutes.\nWhile this technology may eventually allow the complete automation\nand application of medical treatments, it will almost certainly always\nrequire a human element. The precision of AI is the perfect\ncomplement to the personal, analytical, and technical skills of human\nmedical professionals.\nProcess Management\nFor medical practices, AI technology promises greater treatment\ncapacity, reduced medical liability, labor savings, and improved\ncustomer satisfaction. Artificial intelligence makes sense from an\nentrepreneurial stand point, contributing economically to its rapid\ndevelopment and broad application to many industries. Busy practices\ncan automate (with supervision) the scheduling, check-in, diagnosis,\nand follow-up process, as well as obtaining process-refining feedback\nfrom patients. This technology can improve customer retention by\nboosting customer involvement through consistent communication and\nspeed of service.\nSavings on personnel costs and avoiding human error is are a major\nfactor in the adoption of AI and robotics. Practices can reduce the need\nfor doctors and nurses to perform routine tasks, and minimize the time\nrequired to perform essential functions. AI equips them with the tools\nto provide higher-quality services, and build a differentiating\ncompetitive advantage as a technological leader in their market.\nAI and Human Interaction\nShould your doctor or nurse be replaced by a life-like simulation driven\nby AI?\nThis is an emerging question the medical field is being forced to address\ndue to the availability of technology, the promise of reduced labor\ncosts, enhanced operational efficiency, and the potential reduction of\nliability for medical practices.\nModern processing power allows programs to speak and act with a\nclosely human quality that could reduce the workload on medical staff,\nand increase the efficiency of the medical process. Despite the logistical\nadvantages of this technology, controversy has arisen as to the ethical\nconsiderations and social impact.\nThe Future of Medicine\nWhen a device or software has no emotions, the empathy factor is\nremoved. Can we rely on AI to deliver emotionally difficult diagnoses?\nWhat is the value of authentic human interaction in the process? Does\nemotion hinder accurate diagnoses and care? Or, does the passion of\nmedical personnel ensure due diligence and creative thinking?\nThese questions are subjective at heart, and will be a source of debate\nfor generations. The use of AI in medicine is entrenched, and certain to\nbe a leading source of change in the dynamic medical field.\nAt GrailAI, we are working to compliment all of the great research to\ndate by using our own unique algorithms to compare data from\nwearables, DNA and other sources with symptoms that are predictive\nof cancer to find instances in early stages before each are more difficult\nto treat. As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies\nevolve, the developers behind each must carefully consider how to be\nHiPPA compliant, yet push forward aggressively as helping families to\nkeep their loved one safe is worth the investment.\n}}

{{Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC) is aiming at a $2 billion (Dh7.3bn) share of the Middle East\u2019s healthcare market, which is estimated at about $100bn (Dh367bn) per year.\nChief Executive Dr Muhadditha Al Hashimi told Emirates Business she hoped to capture two per cent of the $100bn expenditure despite the large investment that has gone into founding DHCC.\nMore than $20bn (Dh73.4bn) has been invested in DHCC. However, Dr Al Hashimi said the long-term focus of the complex was to provide quality healthcare to the region, rather than break records for revenue.\nSpeaking at the launch of the Arab Health exhibition in Dubai yesterday, Dr Al Hashimi said: \u201cBecause we are in healthcare, we are focused on providing total healthcare and quality healthcare. We are not focused on how much revenue we are going to make.\u201d\nA huge amount of capital has been invested in the projects, such as the UAE\u2019s first university hospital, launched this month in collaboration with Harvard Medical International, a subsidiary of the prestigious Boston-based Harvard Medical School.\nUniversity Hospital, which will cost Dh2.1bn to build, will not only provide state-of-the-art medical services but also medical education and research. Construction commenced last year on the 400-bed, 1.4 million square foot hospital campus and is due for completion by 2011.\nThe project has been entirely funded by Tatweer and Harvard Medical International (HMI) is a strategic partner in the venture. Dr Andrew Jeon, HMI President and Chief Executive, said the organisation does not invest in international projects, instead it provides with excellent expertise.\n\u201cWe do not make direct financial contributions, but rather we participate with those partners. Our sole focus is helping like-minded partners create infrastructure in their countries to provide their population with the best healthcare available,\u201d Jeon told Emirates Business.\nDr Al Hashimi said projects such as the University Hospital will fulfill DHCC\u2019s aim of fostering research and education in healthcare.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to make money in the short-term, we\u2019re focused on getting the standard of healthcare up in this region, helping it become a destination where people will come and then money will come.\u201d\nDr Al Hashimi expects 2008 to be a busy year for DHCC. So far 57 clinics are operational and since 2005, more than 80,000 patients have been treated. Last year alone, the clinics saw 30,000 patients. Phase one of DHCC is more than halfway completed \u2013 60 per cent of phase one is completed and it is due for 100 per cent completion by 2010. All of phase one, which takes up four million square feet, has been sold out. Dr Al Hashimi added: \u201cIn fact, a lot of projects are under construction.\u201d\nStatistics\nDh7.3bn Dubai Healthcare City is aiming at a $2bn share of the Middle East\u2019s healthcare market, which is estimated at about $100bn per year. Muhadditha Al Hashimi says last year the 57 clinics saw a total of 30,000 patients.\n$20bn More than $20bn have been so far invested in the DHCC. A huge capital has been invested in projects such as UAE\u2019s first university hospital, launched this month in collaboration with Harvard Medical International.\n}}

{{It's time travel week at Industry Focus! In this healthcare episode, Kristine Harjes brings on former host Michael Douglass to talk about how the healthcare industry has changed (and some areas it hasn't) since he left the show.\nListen in to hear how his predictions about the Affordable Care Act, MannKind's (NASDAQ:56400P706) much-hyped Afrezza, Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) advancements in hepatitis C treatment, and more, have panned out in the last few years -- plus, learn about three exciting areas he thinks we'll still be talking about on the show for the considerable future. Also, the hosts take a closer look at how a few different companies have reacted to Obamacare since its implementation, and why it's so hard to guess how the law will change the space going forward.\nA full transcript follows the video.\nThis podcast was recorded on April 27, 2016.\nKristine Harjes: The more things change, the more they stay the same, on this healthcare edition of Industry Focus.\nWelcome to Healthcare Industry Focus! It is April 27th, 2016. I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and if you've been listening to the Industry Focus shows that came on Tuesday and Monday of this week, then you'll know it is throwback week. So, we've reached out to some of the folks who were involved with the show before all of your current hosts were. In that light, I have special guest Michael Douglass on the show, who has been doing this kind of thing since before it was even podcast.\nMichael Douglass: Right, yeah. I started at The Motley Fool in early 2014. And at the time, the healthcare show was called Market Checkup, and it was only videos. We didn't do a podcast at all with it. I was there when Industry Focus first became a bi-industry podcast and show, and then was eventually handed off to our much more talented current host, Kristine Harjes.\nHarjes: Well, thanks. I don't know if I can truly accept that compliment. I think you did a great job too. And I'm really excited to have you back on the show today. Just thinking about what has happened in healthcare since I started following the industry, about two years, as I alluded to in this episode's teaser, things have changed a little bit, but a lot of the themes are roughly the same. Let's take a look at one of the biggest topics for you guys that you were covering, which was Obamacare. What was the state of that two or three years ago?\nDouglass: Right. It's kind of funny. As you mentioned, these overall big trends, a lot of them are demographic. Those things don't really change that much. It's an iceberg, a glacier, it moves slowly and it makes big changes over time. The Affordable Care Act had been passed some years before I came, but the open enrollment for the first public exchanges was ongoing when I began in healthcare at The Motley Fool.\nWe were definitely covering, \"Hey, they extended the deadline for the exchanges.\" Because of all the technical difficulties they were having at the time, they ended up extending the deadline through the end of March 2014. And there was a lot of, \"Hey, how many people will they actually get in the exchanges?\" And, \"Is the law going to be a success?\" \"Are they going to get enough young people?\" \"Are the insurers going to play ball?\" There were all of these big, grand, open questions.\nHarjes: There were a ton of questions, and very few answers. I think we're still answering a lot of these questions. One that I want to have you expand on a little bit is why young people were so important.\nDouglass: Young people were considered a proxy for healthy people, as a general rule. That was the shorthand we were using, because young people are less likely to have a lot of chronic illnesses, because many of those tend to be age-related. The hope, then, was that these young people would help mitigate the cost of a lot of very sick people coming on to the exchanges -- sick people who had been previously excluded from personal health insurance. The hope was, then, that could de-risk the pool a little bit, so insurers would be able to make a buck. Then the insurers would play ball and get involved, and the health plans wouldn't become totally unaffordable.\nThere was a lot of discussion of the \"death spiral\" that would happen if not enough young people signed up -- that because of that, insurers had to jack up prices; at which point people who had previously signed up would say, \"Eh, never mind, I'm done,\" and they'd back out; then, the pool would get smaller and smaller and riskier and riskier and more and more expensive -- and it would just cause the law's overall collapse.\nHarjes: What were you personally expecting, and has it played out like that?\nDouglass: The death spiral, obviously, didn't happen.\nHarjes: Whoever came up with that term, that's just brilliant. That really inspires fear right there. The \"death spiral.\"\nDouglass: It was good -- or, depending on your point of view, bad -- marketing. I expected the law to enroll a lot of people, and it certainly did that. I think we actually, at one point, made guesses, and I'm pretty sure I was pretty wildly wrong. But I did guess they'd beat the 7 million they were predicting, and I think they ended up doing 8 million in the exchanges that year, and another 4.8 million or so in Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.\nHarjes: To your credit, nobody has really been able to estimate these things too well. The CBO expected to have 10 million enrollees by the end of 2016, and it far surpassed it, it was 12.7 million for 2016. Of course, there'll be a little bit of attrition there, because the guess was for the end of 2016. Still -- these numbers are really hard to pin down.\nDouglass: Yes. And that's one of those broader healthcare problems. Across the board, we're doing a lot of guesswork, and that's a drawback. I will say, I very much believed that Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) would do very well -- they were called WellPoint at the time, and they've since changed their name to Anthem -- because they decided to play ball. They said, \"You know what? These exchanges are full of people that we can make a relationship with. We operate a lot of Blue Cross Blue Shield policies. We have a great brand, and we think that we can play here, we can play aggressively, we can get a lot of people, and we can build an overall structure that will help us really drive shareholder value.\" And so far, that has very much panned out for Anthem.\nHarjes: They're a little bit unique in this regard. Something we talked about on the show just a few weeks ago was UnitedHealth Group's decision to drop out of almost all of the Obamacare exchanges.\nDouglass: Yeah. UnitedHealth Group was always one of the more skeptical ones. I remember, initially, they only did a handful of exchanges. I want to say it was five, or something like that. And then they scaled up, and then they promptly scaled right back down.\nHarjes: I don't know why, but the image that I get of them watching Obamacare is like, a nervous kid at a pool, who might be a little too cold, so he dips his toes in, and he's not really sure about it, and he says, \"You know what? I'm going to dive in and do this! Rip the Band-Aid off!\" And then he just scampers right back out of the water, because it was way too cold.\nDouglass: I think that's apt. I will say, cost continues to be a problem outside of your Medicaid expansion states. And by the way, no surprise, I think, that the Medicaid expansion has steadily increased. There have been a number of states that were holdouts in 2013 and 2014 that have since expanded Medicaid, because it's just an easy win for them, free money from the government.\nThat has been a boon to your Medicaid insurers. It was pretty clear they were going to benefit from that. Anyone who said that insurance companies would collapse because of the Affordable Care Act, I think, has been proven very much wrong. It's certainly not been a huge net benefit for some of them, but for some, it has been a nice win.\nHarjes: So, one of the other huge things that I'm sure you were talking about a ton a couple of years ago had to do with a more specific niche of the market, and that is in hepatitis C. I remember, when I first started following this industry, it was right before Harvoni, which is a Gilead Sciences hepatitis C drug, was approved. That was a huge, huge story! I can only imagine when its predecessor, Sovaldi, was first approved.\nDouglass: Oh, yeah. I was covering Gilead Sciences when it announced its first quarter 2014 earnings, which was the first full quarter of Sovaldi on the market. Sovaldi had been approved in, I want to say, December of 2013. When the reported in December of 2013, they had like three weeks of data, so it wasn't really helpful.\nBut, their first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi did $2.1 billion, which is just unheard of. It was easily the fastest drug ramp ever. It put this drug on track to be this massive winner in 2014. Previously, you'd had Incivek, by Vertex, which had been a hepatitis C drug. It had managed, I think, $1-point-something billion. It was huge in its time, before Sovaldi completely knocked it off and basically wiped out those revenues almost immediately. Really big story.\nHarjes: One of the worries that came with this, because, people saw what happened to Vertex with Incivek, and they also saw, after that, Johnson & Johnson's Olysio, which also became obsolete, due to the Gilead Science's drugs -- people thought, \"Is this another flash in the pan that's going to be easily replaced by competitive threats?\"\nDouglass: Yeah. Or, even, are they going to treat everybody who's going to be immediately treatable, and then just be done? And that didn't happen. It was pretty darn clear. Even today, Gilead Sciences has treated, I want to say, less than or around 10% of the United States hepatitis C population. And this has been the market that Gilead's been playing in the most. Very much, hepatitis C is a longer-term fix than a lot of people were thinking in those initial heady days, because it just takes time.\nHarjes: Right. And of course, another thing to watch is a potential for a Gilead Sciences pan-genotypic hepatitis C drug. We won't get into the nitty-gritty of exactly what that means, but let's just say, it could be a game-changer in this market. It's looking at a PDUFA date of June 2016.\nDouglass: And that's one of the really cool things about Gilead. When you look at Vertex with Incivek, and Johnson & Johnson with Olysio, they got wiped out by a competitor. What Gilead is doing, in a lot of ways, is wiping out their own drugs. They had Sovaldi, and it was revolutionary. Then they created Harvoni. And Sovaldi sales fell off pretty quickly, but Harvoni became the new standard of care. And now, they're working on this pan-genotypic combination which could potentially become the next standard of care. Consistently, their opponents have just not been able to catch up.\nThis is why they're maintaining about 90% market share in hepatitis C, which is just nuts. You don't see that, really, anywhere. Those of you who have been listening for a while have heard me gush about Gilead in the past, so I'm going to restrain myself from here. But, just for the record, it's really interesting to see how they've been able to do that.\nHarjes: For our listeners, earlier, before this episode, I was on the Gilead Sciences investor relations website, and Michael comes walking over to my desk, and from probably 15 feet away, he goes, \"Oh! You're on Gilead's website, I recognize the coloring!\"\nDouglass: (laughs)\nHarjes: This has to be his favorite stock.\nDouglass: Yes, definitely.\nHarjes: Last major topic that I know you guys were covering a good bit before I picked up the show was the quite epically named MannKind Corporation. If we hop back in that time machine, what was going on with MannKind?\nDouglass: Gosh ... So, MannKind Corporation, ever since I've watched the stock, has been a battleground stock. The key bull thesis around it was, they had this drug called Afrezza, and it's an inhalable insulin, and it's a mealtime insulin. The idea is, for people who don't like the needle pricks, this could be a big thing. It had been rejected by the FDA twice, so, they were coming in for their third potential approval. I think the actual approval date was in June of 2014, so it was right when I started hopping in. It was a really interesting stock. A lot of people were really for it, a lot of people were really against it. I think there was high short interest at the time.\nHarjes: Even then? Wow.\nDouglass: Yeah, kind of your classic battleground stock.\nHarjes: Yeah. There really were sky-high expectations for Afrezza, which, we've seen, as it played out, really didn't take off at all.\nDouglass: And we took a lot of flak, David Williamson and I. We were the precursors to Kristine and Todd on this. We both very much felt that Afrezza was not going to work out very well. And that viewpoint has been largely vindicated.\nHarjes: Indeed. I know you're not afraid of a little bit of speculation--\nDouglass: Uh-oh! (laughs)\nHarjes: Just to put you on the spot, just a little bit -- can you make a prediction for, say, two years from now? What do you think Industry Focus: Healthcare is going to be talking about?\nDouglass: Gosh. Sure. In fact, I'll give you three.\nHarjes: Wow!\nDouglass: Game on.\nHarjes: (laughs) I knew you'd be up for this.\nDouglass: The first one -- you, we, whoever is on the show will absolutely still be talking about the Affordable Care Act.\nHarjes: In whatever way it exists.\nDouglass: In some way, shape, or form. I believe that this health reform seems likely to stay in some way, shape, or form. The adjustments and changes it's making to the industry are tremendous. As a corollary to that, the second thing: I think you're absolutely be talking about mergers and acquisitions. What we've seen was, a lot of hospitals have been buying each other up for a while. This has always been the case in biotech, too. But it's really spread in the last few years to your PBMs and your insurers. We've been seeing a lot of M&A activity. I expect -- maybe we won't be setting records in two years, I don't know. But I think there will still be a lot going on, because consolidation in healthcare gives you economies of scale.\nAnd when you're on the bargaining table, trying to talk about a drug price, if you have more members, that gives you a harder lever to pull, and a better way to say, \"Hey, let's cut a deal.\" You don't want to be not on this formulary. On the flip side, I think you'll see drug companies bulking up for the same reason, because that will give them more drugs, more things in their arsenal, more things to go after. I think that is absolutely going to be a long-term trend in healthcare.\nHarjes: Yeah, it has somewhat of a domino effect.\nDouglass: Exactly. I think the third thing we'll still be talking about -- and we didn't really touch on it here -- is immuno-oncology, because these cancer drugs that, in theory, teach the body how to recognize and kill cancer cells, or at least de-cloak those cancer cells, so the body's natural immune response is triggered. It's something we were talking about two years ago. We didn't have time to talk about it today. I think it's something that will absolutely still be on the agenda two years from now, because it is a broad sector. There's a lot of digging still being done.\nYou've had your early winners. Bristol and Merck have both done pretty well based on their immuno-oncology drugs, Keytruda and Opdivo. But, I think, you have a ton of small-cap biotechs that are now looking into this really hard. You've got Celgene with a lot of their collaborations working on it as well. So, I think there's just enormous opportunity there, and I think that, while one signaling pathway or another, or one set of proteins or another may or may not work out, I expect that will be something that we're still very much looking at it healthcare in two years.\nHarjes: It does feel like it's a field that's still very much in the early stages. Those are some really interesting answers. I'm inclined to agree with them, for the record.\nDouglass: Thank you.\nHarjes: I'm absolutely going to be writing them down in my Outlook calendar for two years from now. We'll check back in. Listeners, we hope that you've enjoyed stepping in the time machine with us for a little bit today. Michael, it's always great when we get to do a show together. Thanks for playing ball.\nDouglass: Thanks for having me.\nHarjes: As always, people on the show may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against these stocks, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

{{A drawing of a mobile Mongol soldier Courtesy of Wikimedia\/Creative Commons\nThis question originally appeared on Quora.\nAnswer by Stephen Tempest:\nMongol success in battle depended on several factors, which combined to make them an extremely effective force. Still, they were not invincible, as the battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 proved.\nTactically, Mongol horse archers were deadly in battle. Their horses allowed them to stay out of reach of the enemy, while their composite bows allowed them to rain down accurate fire. When the enemy army was disorganized and broken up by the losses from the archery fire, the Mongol heavy cavalry would charge in with lance and sword to finish the job.\nThe Mongols were, compared to most other armies in the time period, extremely well-organized and disciplined. For most commanders from other nations, it was an achievement simply to get all their men to agree to fight the same enemy. A Mongol general could rely on his troops to carry out complex plans involving encirclements, flanking maneuvers, and feigned retreats.\nOn the strategic level, the Mongols were extremely mobile. Soldiers had three or four horses each, allowing them to keep up a sustained movement rate far faster than an army traveling on foot, or even with a limited number of horses, could achieve. The Mongols were also used to living off the land, so they were not tied to a slow-moving supply train.\nFinally, the Mongols were willing to exploit the abilities of their subject races. From the Chinese, they recruited large numbers of mechanics and skilled engineers, who allowed them to make catapults and other siege engines to capture fortified cities.\nSo those were the Mongol advantages. How to counter them?\nThe most obvious method is to use the terrain to your advantage. Historically, the Mongols met their most serious defeats in the deserts of Palestine, the jungles of Vietnam, and the ocean between Korea and Japan. Their army was best suited to the steppes, where there was plenty of grass for their horses to graze on and wide, open spaces for them to carry out the broad outflanking moves they excelled at. In deserts, jungles, mountains, or thick forests, their mobility would be limited, their horses would suffer, and they could be tied down to a fixed point and defeated.\nUnfortunately, such a strategy rather depends on having such terrain in the country you\u2019re trying to defend. How then to defeat the Mongols if you have no such natural advantages?\nMost importantly, try to train your army to the same standard of discipline and organization as the Mongols themselves. The best plans will be useless if your subcommanders ignore them and decide to do their own thing in the name of honor and personal glory, or your troops break and run right off the battlefield through their terror of Mongol savagery.\nMake sure you have effective scouting and reconnaissance, too. If the Mongols are ravaging the countryside, the peasants of your own nation should be willing to help provide information on their locations and numbers. Encourage them, listen to them, and set up a system to feed this information into your headquarters. Station riders with fast horses who know the countryside well to bring you news of where the Mongols are at all times. Their fast outflanking maneuvers will be less effective if you know where they are: Instead, perhaps you can ambush them, as Baibars did at Ain Jalut.\nWhen the battle begins, you need troops who can defeat the Mongol horse archers and lancers. This is where the longbow and heavy crossbow come into their own.\nTake two equally fit and equally well-trained archers. Have one of them bouncing around on the back of a moving horse; have the other standing with both feet firmly planted on the ground. Which of them will be most effective? The foot archer, of course. He can also use a larger and more powerful bow. He\u2019s a smaller target than the combination of a man plus a horse. And he can carry a large shield or have someone else stand in front of him holding a shield. (That\u2019s how the ancient Persians defeated horse archers back in their own day\u2014regiments of archers with shield-bearers standing in front of them. Not very effective against Macedonian pikemen, but deadly against Central Asian cavalry.)\nThe one disadvantage of foot archers is that they can be vulnerable if the cavalry decide instead to charge home with the lance instead of sniping with the bow. How to defend against this? One way is to do what the English did at Agincourt\u2014hammer thousands of sharp wooden stakes into the ground in front of their lines to form an impenetrable hedge of sharp points facing the enemy cavalry. Or combine your archers with a force of heavy infantry, such as pikemen. Their armor and shields will protect them from the Mongol archery, while they form a defensive line for your own archers to shield them from cavalry charges.\nThese combined arms tactics would be perfected by Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries, after handheld firearms were invented; but there\u2019s no reason why you couldn\u2019t organize a tercio or battalion formation with archers instead of musketeers.\nCombined-arms tactics to use against horse archers were already 1,000 years old when the Mongols invaded. They just needed training and discipline to be effective.\nThe one big disadvantage of such an army is that being on foot is comparatively slow-moving compared to the Mongols. Their best response is to avoid battle and keep their distance while attempting to surround me and cut me off from my sources of supply. How to counter this?\nThe obvious approach is to have wagons full of supplies and spare arrows at the center of my army or at the rear if my flanks are protected\u2014that\u2019s how Richard the Lionheart defeated Saladin at Arsuf. With my supplies with me, I can outlast the Mongols. This is expensive\u2014few medieval kingdoms could afford such a measure, as opposed to just living off the land\u2014but it\u2019s the best strategy.\nAlternatively, I need to force them to attack me head-on. How? Well, the Mamluks won at Ain Jalut through trickery: They sent a small force to bait the Mongols into attacking them, while the rest of their army lurked in the nearby hills ready to swoop out once the enemy was committed to battle.\nAn alternative approach, which is a classic strategy in 19th-century warfare, is to identify some target which the enemy cannot afford to lose, and move to attack it. They are therefore forced to attack you\u2014at a time and place of your choosing\u2014or else stand by and watch you capture or destroy your objective.\nThis strategy is tricky against a nomadic enemy like the Mongols, but they still had cities under their control. A powerful, slow moving army carrying its supplies with it could move into their territory and burn their cities, challenging the Khan to come out and fight it. Alternatively, if you attack in high summer, you can set fire to the grasslands on which their horse herds depend. Of course, such a measure will hurt the Mongols\u2019 subject people too, who might be your own citizens\u2014so this strategy is a ruthless and cruel one. Still, the Mongols themselves employed cruelty deliberately as a strategy of war, trusting that their opponents would be more squeamish than themselves.\nWhat about a long-term policy? Here, it\u2019s instructive to look at how the Mongols were eventually defeated and conquered by the Russians. Their weapon was the ostrog, or small fortress. A defended military post would be established in Mongol territory, with a secure supply route back to the heartland (preferably by sea or river, so the Mongols couldn\u2019t cut it). Of course the Mongols could lay siege to the fortress, but that would mean concentrating their army together in one place where your superior forces could attack and defeat them.\nIf they didn\u2019t attack, then you would attack them. Beat them at their own game\u2014send out raiding parties of light cavalry to ravage, pillage, and burn the Mongol lands and, most importantly, kill their horses. These cavalry raiding parties were the origin of the famous Cossacks. When the Mongols struck back, the Cossacks would retreat back to the safety of the fort and dare the Mongols to attack them.\nEventually, the Mongols would get tired of their horses being killed and retreat further back into the steppes. At which point, you would build another ostrog deeper into the steppes and repeat the process, while the previous fortress became the core of a new city.\nMore questions on Ancient Warfare:\n}}

But they are radically different than the jungle boots soldiers wore throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe outer sole is similar to the popular Panama-style tread on the old jungle boot but is designed with a shorter heel so there is less of a chance of it snagging on debris and undergrowth and becoming a trip hazard.\nThe new design features a thick polyurethane insert that has channels and perforations to move water away from the foot.\nThe old jungle boots had two drain holes that often became clogged with mud. The new boots feature several small perforations into the fabric on both sides of the boot that are more effective at pushing water out of the boots, Army officials maintain.\n}}

It is not yet clear how many terrorists were killed by artillery fire and in the strikes by the air force,\" Gurak said.\nHe added that two soldiers remained unaccounted for after the fighting which lasted late into Friday night and that a search was underway to find them.\nGurak initially said two soldiers were wounded in the fighting, but Prime Minister Erdogan, speaking in televised remarks from Turkmenistan, raised the number to 20.\n\"Our struggle (against the PKK) will continue with determination. We will discuss what methods we will follow in this struggle,\" he added.\nAnatolia reported that Erdogan was expected to chair a meeting of civilian and military leaders at 1400 GMT in Ankara to assess the developments.\nFriday\u2019s attack comes a day after the end of a three-day ceasefire the PKK announced for Eid-ul-Fitr, the Muslim festival marking the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting.\nThe PKK, considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has been fighting for a separate state in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since 1984.\nAccording to figures recently released by the Turkish army, the 24-year campaign by the rebels had cost the lives of 32,000 Kurdish rebels, 6,500 members of the security forces and 5,500 civilians.\nTurkey claims that thousands of PKK militants are holed up in rear bases in the Kurdish-run north of Iraq from where they stage cross-border attacks on Turkish targets.\nAnkara also accuses the autonomous Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, of failing to take steps against the rebels who it says are able to move freely in the mountainous enclave and obtain arms and explosives.\nThe Turkish army, under a one-year parliamentary authorisation obtained last October, has carried out air strikes and a week-long ground incursion against PKK targets, using intelligence passed on by NATO ally United States.\nThe authorisation expires on October 17 and the Turkish government said last week that it will ask parliament to extend the mandate by one year.\nLawmakers returned from summer recess on October 1 and are expected to vote on the matter in the coming weeks.\n}}

{{An internal military investigation has concluded that Israel's 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon failed because top commanders didn't communicate properly and were slow to prepare a ground offensive, the retired general who conducted the probe said Saturday.\nThe reserve general, Udi Shani, also said that the army chief at the time, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, wasn't receptive enough to dissenting views among top commanders and should have spent more time near the front lines, rather than at military headquarters.\n\"The military failed,\" Shani told Israel Radio. \"It didn't operate properly.\"\nDefense Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday he would not leave Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government, but would stay on to redress the problems in the military that the fighting exposed.\nBarak's announcement at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting removed any immediate threat to the survival of Olmert's government as it pursues its declared goal of signing a peace treaty with the Palestinians this year. Barak had said before joining the coalition in June that he would push for Olmert's resignation or early elections after a war inquiry delivered its final report.\n\"Why am I staying? I'm staying in the post of defense minister because I know what kind of challenges face Israel -- Gaza, Hezbollah, Syria, Iran, the rehabilitation of the military and the political process,\" Barak said.\nIf Barak were to have pulled Labor's 19-member faction out of the coalition, Olmert would have been stripped of his parliamentary majority and likely forced to call an election. His coalition now controls 67 of parliament's 120 seats.\nBut with Labor trailing badly in public opinion polls, Barak apparently decided his party's political fortunes -- and his own -- would be better served by remaining in the government. Barak hopes to reclaim the premiership he briefly held before losing it in early 2001, but polls would hand the race to hawkish opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu of the hardline Likud Party.\nGiven the poll results, his decision to remain in government had been expected.\nWinograd Commission findings\nShani conducted an internal army investigation of the performance of the top command at the same time as a five-member investigative panel headed by retired Judge Eliyahu Winograd examined the performance of the government and the army.\nThe Winograd Commission said in its final report Wednesday that Israel did not win the 34-day war and the army did not provide an effective response to a deadly Hezbollah barrage of nearly 4,000 rockets on northern Israel. Israel conducted a heavy aerial campaign but reservists returning from the battlefield complained of poor training and a lack of ammunition and key supplies.\nAccording to official figures from both sides, between 1,035 and 1,191 Lebanese civilians and combatants died in the conflict, in addition to 119 Israeli soldiers and 40 civilians.\nShani said that the reliance on air attacks was reasonable in the first few days of the war, but that commanders then should have prepared for a ground offensive.\nInstead, the military embarked on the ground offensive at the last minute, just as a U.N. truce was about to take effect. More than 30 Israeli soldiers were killed in that fighting.\n\"The military failed because it had an erroneous concept,\" Shani said in an apparent reference to the heavy reliance on air strikes.\nWinograd said the 11th-hour offensive failed in its mission, did not improve Israel's position and that the army was not prepared for it. However, he said the operation's goals were legitimate.\nMost of the army's wartime commanders, including Halutz, resigned after the war.\n}}

{{Ukraine soldiers will be armed with U.S. field rations of wheat snack bread, Sloppy Joe sauce or any other MRE favorite should a shooting war break out with the Russians, the U.S. State Department announced Wednesday.\nGen. Joseph Dunford, U.S. commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said Ukraine politicians have asked the U.S. for any military equipment in Afghanistan the U.S. doesn't want to ship all the way back to North America. The Marine four-star said the U.S. has not agreed to send any additional weapons to Ukraine.\nOf course, sending weapons to Ukraine would cause political complications with the Russians. However, sending food that's designed to survive for 3.5 years and offer 1,200 calories per meal doesn't provide the same diplomatic problems as aircraft, missile defense systems or rifles.\nThe State Department announcement didn't verify what types of MREs the Ukrainians would receive. Army officials recently made a major MRE break through when the service finally developed the pizza MRE. No word yet if the Ukrainians made special orders of pizza, chicken fajita or Sloppy Joe -- three U.S. troop favorites.\nAnother possibility is the U.S. could have unloaded the stockpiles of Country Captain's Chicken, Thai Chicken, and Beef Teriyaki MREs the Army scrapped years ago onto the Ukrainians. If so, this could prove to be a major morale issue inside the Ukrainian military, as many U.S. soldiers could attest.\n}}

{{The U.S. Army has been plagued with costly acquisition failures in recent decades, chief amongst them the Future Combat System (FCS) program. This $200 billion program initiated in 2000, the largest U.S. military acquisition program ever attempted, failed to produce results on a multitude of levels and was abandoned by 2009.\nThe Armored Ground Vehicle (AGV) and Armored Gun System (AGS) programs also wasted tens of billions of dollars before being cancelled without achieving their intended goals. These programs were chiefly defeated by an overly bureaucratic Army acquisition system, and the fact that the Army had asked for far too much from the defense industry, demanding many new and unproven technological advancements.\nThe FCS was the most expensive, most ambitious, and most transformative modernization program ever undertaken by the U.S. Army. It is often hypothesized that the U.S. experience in the first Gulf War of 1991 and in the NATO Kosovo intervention of 1999, led to the desire for a more rapidly deployable U.S. Army expeditionary force. FCS envisioned a highly mobile new Army, light enough to be air-deployable, yet lethal enough to survive on the modern battlefield. This survivability would be provided through the leveraging of new technologies, as well as superior command and control capabilities that would tie together all the various armed forces in a seamless information sharing and communications network.\nThe Army set very high deployment goals as part of FCS, which would prove to be unattainable. The U.S. Army would strive to attain the ability to deploy a combat brigade anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a full division within 120 hours, and no less than five divisions in 30 days. Often referred to as \u201c18+1+1\u201d, FCS envisioned 20 different components integrated together to form the new warfighting system. Eighteen new manned and unmanned vehicles were planned, one computer network integrating all components, communications, information and services, and most importantly, the fighting soldier.\nCurrently, the U.S. Army relies overwhelmingly on armored vehicle systems that were developed in the 1970s. These systems proved their worth over the last two decades. These \u201clegacy\u201d systems have been repeatedly improved since their introduction. These improvements have consisted of more powerful and efficient engines and drivetrain, modernized communications equipment, targeting and sensory upgrades, improved armor and improved weapons systems\nThe U.S. Army currently fields the M1A2 SEP (System Enhancement Package) MBTs which are a significant improvement over older models. The latest improvement on the design is the SEPv.3 (version 3). The SEPv.3 achieves notable improvements in its fire control system, ballistics computer and thermal imaging sights. The SEPv.3 has been strengthened against IED attacks, and has additional layers of graphite coated depleted uranium added to its composite armor. It is considered one of the best protected MBTs in the world, despite the fact that it currently lacks an Active Protection System (APS). It has been proposed that the M1A2 SEPv.3 can be retrofitted with the Israeli Trophy APS, or the Quick Kill APS system being developed by Raytheon.\nThe M2A2 Bradley (see video blow, deployed in Eastern Europe) has proven quite reliable and agile on the modern battlefield. One weakness that was exhibited in its early combat history, was its low level of armor protection. The M2A3 incorporates a number of upgrades which will theoretically extend its life span out to 2030.\nPre-positioned Bradley Fighting Vehicles conduct live-fire exercises at Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany on 5\/5\/2014. The gunnery exercise is the first time U.S. Army Forces have used a set of armored vehicles and equipment prepositioned in Grafenwoehr, including the most up-to-date versions of the M2\/M3 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, for live-fire training in Europe. Film Credit: Gertrud Zach and Markus Rauchenberger\nAn improved fire control system and thermal sights adds to the vehicle\u2019s lethality. The greatest weakness of the vehicle design was remedied by including roof fragmentation protection and mounts for additional armor for use against shaped charge anti-armor munitions. The Bradley Urban Survivability Kit (BUSK) was also developed by the manufacturer BAE Systems, so that the vehicle can be tailored to combat in urban environments.\nFirst adopted in 1960 and first used in combat during the Vietnam War, the M113 APC is the most numerous and widely used armored vehicle in the U.S. military. Over 15 different variants have been produced, some of which still form the backbone of the mechanized formations of the U.S. Army. Although replaced by the M2A3 Bradley and Stryker in most frontline combat roles, the M113 is still used in a support role.\nThe most widely used self-propelled artillery vehicle in the U.S. Army inventory is the M109 Paladin 155mm howitzer. It is a fully tracked vehicle with a fully traversable turret. The most modern version of the M109 is the M109A6 variant. The M109A6 is equipped with an automatic fire control system, ballistic computer, and inertial positioning system which allows for great accuracy out to a range of 40km when Excalibur guided munitions are employed.\nFurther development of the M109A7 Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) by BAE Systems was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board in 2013. This program envisions the reworking of the vehicle chassis to incorporate as many components of the M2A3 Bradley as possible. This will lower logistics, inventory and maintenance costs considerably.\nThe M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a 12 rocket, surface-to-surface rocket artillery system. The M270 tracked chassis is based on an elongated M2 Bradley vehicle. The M270A1 can launch the entire family of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, some out to a range of 165km. Lockheed Martin developed the Guided MLRS in 2002 and it is now a standard armament for the system. The GLMRS utilizes a GPS and inertial guidance system fitted in the nose of the XM30 rocket, which turns the rocket into a guided projectile with a range of 70km.\nThe main U.S. Army mobile air defense artillery systems are the short range FIM-92 Stinger and the long range MIM-104 Patriot. Both systems are highly mobile, and are flexible enough to be fielded in a number of different configurations. Although not normally mounted on armored vehicles, both systems are capable of being mounted to existing armored platforms. The Stinger has been mounted on the M2 Bradley IFV; however, the most common vehicle mounted manifestation of the Stinger is the Avenger, which is equipped with 8 missiles in two quad launchers in a turreted housing mounted of the HMMWV.\nOriginally adopted as an interim substitute while the armored vehicles envisioned by the FCS were developed, the Stryker has served the U.S. Army as a front line combat vehicle for approximately 16 years, and has been modified and improved periodically over that time span. General Dynamics of Canada developed the vehicle based on their existing LAV III vehicle. There are eleven different variants of the Stryker, with a variant to cover all eight of the manned vehicle systems envisioned by FCS. The M1128 Stryker Mobile Gun System (MGS) mounts a 105mm cannon, which is a light weight version of the original gun utilized in the M1A1 Abrams and M60 MBTs.\nThe Stryker is a light armored vehicle. Although providing all around protection from small arms fire, the Stryker can be fitted with both slat armor and explosive reactive tiles for added protection. Although there are anti-tank Strykers in each Brigade Combat Team with an added anti-armor capability, the main variant is lightly armed with a crew-serviced machine gun, or a Mk19 40mm grenade launcher. The U.S. Army is currently planning to equip a small number of Strykers with a 30mm autocannon, which will provide greater offensive capability against light armored vehicles, structures and infantry.\nAlthough its legacy systems are quite capable today, the U.S. Army has recognized the need to dispense with its overly bureaucratic weapons acquisition process of past decades in an attempt to stay one step ahead of its closest peers, Russia and China. Both Russia and China have made great strides in recent years to gain parity with the United States on the modern battlefield.\nIf you\u2019re able, and if you like our content and approach, please support the project.

{{Nearly four years ago, Spec. Hilda Clayton, a combat photographer in the U.S. Army, was documenting a live-fire exercise in Afghanistan when, without warning, a mortar tube accidentally exploded in front of her.\nClayton, 22, was killed in the blast, along with an Afghan military photographer she was training and three Afghan National Army soldiers. Eleven other people were injured.\nIn the instant before the device detonated, Clayton snapped one last picture. So did her trainee.\nOn Monday, the Army published the images in its May-June issue of the Military Review, the Army\u2019s professional journal.\nUnreleased until now, they offer a haunting view of a soldier\u2019s final moments, capturing the dizzying burst of fire, smoke and debris that claimed the lives of five people.\nIn a short write-up on the incident, Military Review praised Clayton\u2019s service, saying she died documenting a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d of the war in Afghanistan.\n\u201cThe story was not in the fighting but in the partnership that was necessary between U.S. and Afghan forces to stabilize the Afghan nation,\u201d Military Review wrote.\n\u201cNot only did Clayton help document activities aimed at shaping and strengthening the partnership but she also shared in the risk by participating in the effort,\u201d the journal wrote. \u201cClayton\u2019s death symbolizes how female soldiers are increasingly exposed to hazardous situations in training and in combat on par with their male counterparts.\u201d\nClayton was the first combat documentation and production specialist to be killed in Afghanistan, the Army said.\nBill Darley, managing editor of Military Review, told Time that the photos were brought to the journal\u2019s attention by a staff member who served with her. The current issue focused in part on gender equality, so it was an opportune time to pay homage to her, he told the magazine.\nAfter the images were shared widely online, the journal wrote: \u201cThis edition of the Military Review is focused on promoting the concepts of gender equality and these photographs illustrate the dangers our military men and women face both in training and in combat.\u201d\nClayton\u2019s family approved the release of the photos, as did her unit, Stars and Stripes reported.\nCombat photographers have demanding and often dangerous jobs. The primary mission is to follow combat soldiers wherever they\u2019re deployed and capture their operations \u201cin any environment,\u201d as the journal noted.\nClayton, who was from Augusta, Georgia, had been deployed overseas for less than a year when she died. After graduating from the Defense Information School in July 2012, she was assigned as a visual specialist to the Army\u2019s 55th Signal Co., known as Combat Camera, according to the Augusta Chronicle.\nShe was always willing to take on any mission and she pursued every opportunity to tell our story with her images\nShe was attached to the 4th Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, in Afghanistan, where her mission was to document the training of Afghan forces. The brigade is nicknamed \u201cLong Knife.\u201d\nIn July 2013, Clayton was in Laghman Province in northeastern Afghanistan taking pictures of her American and Afghan counterparts when the mortar exploded. The Army said the group was conducting a \u201cmortar validation exercise\u201d at Forward Operating Base Gamberi.\nA number of Clayton\u2019s images had already been featured on the Pentagon and Army\u2019s websites, as well as in print publications, Army officials told the Chronicle in 2013. Combat Camera honored Clayton by naming its annual best combat photography competition after her.\n\u201cSpc. Clayton embodied the Cavalry spirit. She was always willing to take on any mission and she pursued every opportunity to tell our story with her images,\u201d Col. Bill Benson, commander of Long Knife, wrote in an open letter shortly after Clayton\u2019s death. Her photos, he added, \u201ctold the story of U.S. efforts in Afghanistan\u201d and the maturation of Afghan forces.\n\u201cIn the short time that she was with Long Knife, she earned the respect and admiration of everyone she came in contact with,\u201d Benson wrote. \u201cThough nothing can fill the void that has been left, I hope that there is some consolation in knowing that Spc. Clayton was a valuable member of the Long Knife team and that she made a positive difference every day that she was with us.\u201d\n}}

{{The Army last month tested prototypes of its new helmet, or Integrated Head Protection System (IHPS), for suitability in airborne operations.\nTroops from the 57th Sapper Company, 27th Engineer Battalion, 20th Engineer Brigade, out of Fort Hood, Texas, jumped with the new helmets from a C-17 Globemaster III at 1,250 feet over the Sicily drop zone at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\nThe jump test was coordinated by the U.S. Army Operational Test Command's Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.\n\"Operational testing is about soldiers. It is about making sure that the systems developed are effective in a soldier's hands and suitable for the environments in which soldiers train and fight,\" Col. Brad Mock, head of the test directorate, said in an Army release.\nAccording to Leon L. Price, a test officer with the test directorate, the purpose of the operational test using airborne paratroopers was to collect data to evaluate the suitability and safety of the IHPS when worn during static-line airborne operations.\nThe new helmet is slightly lighter than the current Army Combat Helmet and includes accessories such as a mandible, visor, night-vision goggle attachment device and a system to measure head trauma.\nTest Manager Steve McNair, of Program Manager Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, said the Army is expected to field 7,000 Integrated Head Protection Systems to separate brigades during fiscal 2018 before moving to full-rate production for fielding across the force.\n}}

{{Personnel strength of the Regular Army has dropped below 500,000 for the first time in 10 years, with 498,642 soldiers being listed on active duty in the most recent official headcount of the force.\nStatistics compiled by the Defense Manpower Data Center show that as the Army entered 2015 its reserve components had a combined strength of 547,007 soldiers \u2014 349,881 in the National Guard, and 197,126 in the Army Reserve.\nThe Army drawdown is on track to reduce the active component to 490,000 soldiers by Oct. 1, as required in the fiscal 2015 budget authorization from Congress.\nThe drawdown is projected to continue after Oct. 1, with the fiscal 2016 spending request now before Congress listing an objective end-strength for next year of 475,000 soldiers, which is well shy of the manning projections of 450,000 to 420,000 soldiers that may be necessary if mandatory spending cuts called sequestration continue to the end of the decade.\nDMDC statistics show that over the past 12 months, Army strength was reduced by 24,331 soldiers.\nMost of that reduction was generated by capping recruiting at fewer than 60,000 soldiers, and re-enlistments at 50,000. Additional reductions were generated by involuntary early retirement boards for senior officers and retention screenings for majors, captains and senior NCOs.\nDemographic information compiled by the DMDC shows that women comprise 13.9 percent of the Regular Army, with 16,024 officers, 52,793 enlisted soldiers and 768 West Point cadets serving on active duty.\nA member of the Maryland National Guard stands watch near the inner harbor on Saturday, May 2, 2015, in Baltimore.

{{Soldiers deserve the best equipment money can buy so they are protected in combat. Taxpayers footing the bill equally deserve to have their money well spent.\nThat's a delicate balance and it probably wouldn't surprise you if I told you that balance wasn't achieved on a purchase of millions of military uniforms. What you may be surprised to learn is that the uniforms weren't for our own troops \u2014 they were for the Afghan National Army.\nThe Department of Defense bought costly uniforms that may not even be functional, according to an audit released last week.\nThe uniforms have a forest camouflage color scheme despite only about 2 percent of Afghanistan being forested, raising questions about their ability to conceal soldiers from combatants. And the uniforms already may have cost up to $28 million more than necessary and could waste an additional $70 million over the next decade if changes aren't made, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.\nThe Department of Defense procured the uniforms without determining the camouflage pattern's effectiveness in Afghanistan compared with other available patterns, the inspector general said.\n\"As a result, neither DOD nor the Afghan government knows whether the ... uniform is appropriate to the Afghan environment, or whether it actually hinders their operations by providing a more clearly visible target to the enemy,\" the audit said.\nCAPTION Morning Call Watchdog Paul Muschick offers advice on how to dispute an erroneous or fraudulent charge on your credit card Morning Call Watchdog Paul Muschick offers advice on how to dispute an erroneous or fraudulent charge on your credit card CAPTION Morning Call Watchdog Paul Muschick offers advice on how to dispute an erroneous or fraudulent charge on your credit card Morning Call Watchdog Paul Muschick offers advice on how to dispute an erroneous or fraudulent charge on your credit card CAPTION More than 11,900 fireworks injuries were treated in U.S. emergency rooms in 2015.

Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller discusses the high cost of medical helicopter flights to some patients and the state's inability to intervene.\nIf you're wondering why our government is buying uniforms for the Afghan army, equipping and training Afghan forces to provide their own security is part of the U.S. reconstruction effort there.\nPrior to 2007, the Afghan National Army relied on a \"hodgepodge\" of uniforms donated from several nations, the audit said. In 2007, the Afghan Ministry of Defense decided a new and distinctive uniform was needed. That expense was covered by U.S. taxpayers.\nWhen designing uniforms, the Defense Department can use its own camouflage pattern or one it already has the rights to use, or it can buy rights to a \"proprietary\" pattern.\nA proprietary pattern from HyperStealth Biotechnology Corp. was chosen. The HyperStealth camouflage pattern was found online by U.S. personnel who were assisting the Afghans with developing the uniform and the Afghan minister of defense \"liked what he saw,\" according to the audit.\nThe Defense Department's contracting office raised concerns about the acquisition strategy preferred by the Afghans and noted that the U.S. already had the rights to many uniform patterns that could be used. The audit said a senior official with the U.S. Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan responded to those concerns with an email saying the Afghans already had chosen the pattern they wanted.\n\"We cannot and will not pick for them,\" the email said, according to the audit.\nThe government did, though, pay for them.\nThrough January, the Defense Department had spent about $94 million for about 1.4 million uniforms and about 88,000 extra pairs of pants.\nThe inspector general questioned whether the purchases met federal acquisition regulations because, it said, the department was \"unable to provide market research indicating that other companies' similar products were inadequate.\"\nThe uniforms potentially cost American taxpayers about $28 million more than necessary, based on a comparison to the costs of uniforms worn by Afghan National Police patterned after the U.S. Army's battle dress uniform, the audit said.\nChanging the Afghan army's uniform to that pattern could save taxpayers $68 to $71 million over the next decade, the audit said.\nIn a written response to the audit, acting Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Jedidiah Royal said a cost-benefit analysis of the uniforms would be conducted.\nRoyal said the department would look into whether there was a violation of federal purchasing regulations. He said the department since has changed how uniforms for Afghan forces are purchased to ensure accountability and quality assurance.\nThis isn't the first time the government's military spending in Afghanistan has been questioned.\nI wrote a few years ago about the Defense Department burning through $20 million to build trash incinerators that never were used at military bases in Afghanistan. Those bases torched their trash in open-air pits instead of using the incinerators, exposing personnel to potentially harmful emissions, according to the inspector general.\nSpending millions on military gear that accomplishes its mission is an expense I think most people would accept. Expenditures such as these, however, are just another slap in the face to taxpayers.\nThe Watchdog is published Thursdays and Sundays.

{{Word spread rapidly from Florida A&M University President Elmira Mangum to friends on social media around the country Monday when it was learned Antonio Davon Brown was among the 49 people killed Sunday morning during a massacre inside an Orlando nightclub.\nBrown, a native of Cocoa Beach, graduated from FAMU in 2008 with a degree in criminal justice. He also earned a commission as a second lieutenant, having completed Army ROTC studies at FAMU.\n\"Our hearts go out to all of the families of those affected in the tragic shooting that took place in Orlando on Sunday morning,\" FAMU President Elmira Mangum said in a statement. \"The horrendous incident happened not far from the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University Law School in downtown Orlando.\n\"We are especially saddened by the news that one of the victims was part of the FAMU family,\" she said of Brown. \"He graduated from FAMU in 2008 and is being remembered fondly by classmates and fellow alumni on social media.\"\nMangum said the university will provide an update plans for a memorial or service of remembrance for Brown.\n\"In the meantime, the Florida A&M University community stands with the entire Orlando community in the wake of tragedy,\" she said. \"Our thoughts, and prayers for peace are with everyone in central Florida and across this nation.\"\nFAMU also announced The FAMU Law School Student Association will hold a Gathering for Reflection and Healing at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday in Orlando. It will be held in the Atrium of the College of Law, and is open to all members of the College of Law community, their family members and friends.\nLt. Col. Kelvin Scott taught ROTC at FAMU from 2005 to 2008. He hadn't heard the news of Brown's death until reached by a reporter.\n\"He was a very positive young man,\" said Scott, who now teaches Junior ROTC in Cusseta, Georgia. \"He kept a smile on his face. He was a very positive person with a very good sense of humor. He was willing to work very hard to earn his commission.\"\nScott said he couldn't recall if Brown was a scholarship ROTC student or not, but that he received the same benefits and stipend as others.\n\"I do want to keep his family in our prayers and remember him for being a great person who was willing to work hard,\" Scott said.\nFriends took to Facebook and Twitter to recall Brown, who was a captain in the Army reserves at the time of his death. At least one person indicated he had served in Iraq and in Afghanistan. He also pledged a graduate chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity while in Kansas City in 2011.\nDevonta White, 31, remembers how Brown made him feel welcomed when he transferred to FAMU from Tennessee State in 2006. The two were neighbors on the first floor of Gibbs Hall. White was originally from Detroit and was new to the campus.\n\"He had a car so when he went to Wal-Mart, I would ride with him,\" said White, a 2011 graduate of FAMU's School of Business & Industry who now works in marketing for Ralph Lauren in New York. \"We just became good friends over time. He helped me more than he knows.\"\nWhite said Brown got up early to be on time for drills and became close with ROTC students, but remained friends with White, who also made other friends.\nWhite said he remembers Brown's bright smile and positive attitude. He said they last talked when White graduated from FAMU and he told Brown that \"he had finally made it out.\"\nWhite said he was sitting at his desk Monday when he got the alert from FAMU of Brown's death.\n\"It hit close to home because I had other friends who knew another one of the victims, Shane Tomlinson, whose name was released earlier Monday; Antonio's name was released later,\" he said.\nLt. Col, Gregory Clark, president of the FAMU National Alumni Association, also issued a statement in response to the Orlando deaths.\n\"The Florida A&M University Alumni Family is truly saddened to learn of the tragic shooting in Orlando that has claimed the lives of so many innocent victims; including one of our own,\" he wrote. \"Their hopes and dreams have been lost because of a senseless act of violence. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of alumnus Antonio Brown and the grief-stricken families of those who are struggling now to cope with the overwhelming loss of their loved ones.

{{After years of rebuilding a war-weary force, U.S. Army leaders now say they know the budget year the service can shift the funding priority from readiness to future modernization.\nOver the next four years, the Army will follow a path that involves upgrading equipment, refurbishing stockpiles of key munitions and adding more soldiers to the ranks.\nWhile readiness remains a priority, leaders maintain that the service is in a lot better shape than it was five years ago, according to Lt. Gen. John Murray, deputy chief of staff for Army G8.\n\"We have prioritized readiness in particular for the last five or six years, so I fundamentally believe we are in good shape in terms of readiness,\" he told an audience at the 9th Annual \"Dense Programs\" Conference, sponsored by McAleese and Associates.\n\"We should start to reach readiness recovery in about the 2022 time frame; that is what we are projecting,\" Murray said.\nIn the Army's proposed fiscal 2019 budget, the service said it plans to buy 148,287 155mm artillery projectiles, compared to last year's purchase of 16,573. It also intends to buy 9,450 Guided Multi Launch Rocket Systems, compared to last year's purchase of 6,084.\n\"We have made significant investments in preferred munitions,\" Murray said. \"That is to make up for areas we have taken risk in the past because we significantly under-invested in preferred munitions even though they were being expended in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\"We have pretty much maxed out every line in the country in production of munitions,\" he said.\nThe fiscal 2019 budget adds 4,000 soldiers to the active force, a \"modest-growth\" trend the Army intends to follow over the next few years, Murray said, to increase capabilities in the areas of fires, air defense, cyber, electronic warfare and the service's new Security Force Assistance Brigades.\nBut aside from readiness, future modernization is quickly becoming a priority that can no longer be ignored, he said.\n\"The Army has to have the ability to do both; we cannot afford to just fund readiness and not modernization and, specific to modernization, we can't just incrementally upgrade current systems,\" Murray said.\n\"We also have to invest in new capabilities for the next battlefield because what we have today is good equipment, but it has just about reached the limits of its ability to be upgraded,\" he said.\nLast October, Under Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy launched a massive acquisition reform effort designed to streamline how the service develops new requirements and fields equipment.\nThe Army will stand up a new Futures Command this summer that will oversee special cross-functional teams (CFTs) made up of members of requirements, technology development, acquisitions and operational communities.\nThe CFTs will work to find new ways to rapidly develop and field new platforms in the Army's six modernization priorities -- long-range precision fires; next-generation combat vehicle; future vertical lift; a mobile and expeditionary network; air and missile defense capabilities; and soldier lethality, Army officials say.\n\"The CFTs are meeting with the vice chief of staff and the under secretary, on most weeks, two to three times a week for direct oversight,\" Murray said.\nAt the end of April, Army Secretary Mark Esper is scheduled to present the service's \"comprehensive modernization strategy\" to Congress, Murray said.\nThe Army conducted \"science and technology reviews last fall and moved $2.3 billion across two different reviews to align now 80 percent of our S&T portfolio against these six unique capability\" areas, McCarthy said.\nAs the Army nears its readiness goals, leaders plan to shift more money from readiness to modernization as officials prepare future budget program objective memorandums, or POMs, Murray said.\n\"I have commitment from the secretary and the under secretary that, if we achieve that readiness rate, we will work the readiness accounts as we invest more into the modernization accounts,\" he said. \"I won't give you a dollar figure, but it is pretty significant dollars we are working into the 2020 POM submission in support of the CFTs.\"\n-- Matthew Cox can be reached at matthew.cox@military.com.\n}}

{{More than half a million black African soldiers who fought in the British army during the second world war were paid up to three times less than their white counterparts, a newly unearthed document has revealed, prompting calls for an investigation and the government to compensate surviving veterans.\nThe document, buried in Britain\u2019s national archives, reveals how the government systematically discriminated against African soldiers, paying white personnel \u2013 even those living in African colonies and serving alongside African soldiers in British colonial units \u2013 far more than their black counterparts.\nThe international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, acknowledged that inequalities existed in the past.\nLabour MPs are calling for a government inquiry into the matter. On Wednesday, Wayne David, the shadow defence minister, demanded an immediate official investigation: \u201cThe defence secretary ought to make an announcement to the House of Commons and put on the record that this was wrong and that he\u2019ll put it right \u2013 as simple and straightforward and emphatic as that \u2026 There needs to be a full-scale government inquiry and all the information needs to be brought forward.\u201d\nThe document was uncovered by the makers of a documentary for Al Jazeera English\u2019s People and Power series. It reveals that Britain paid its soldiers not only according to their rank and length of service but also the colour of their skin.\nA table from an official British government document, published in 1945, outlining the pay scale for various races. Photograph: Kew Archives\n\u201cThe colonial regime placed a different value on African life than it did on European life,\u201d said Prof Timothy Parsons, one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on Britain\u2019s east African army, who is calling on the government to redress the injustices exacted on these soldiers by British rule. \u201cThere may be an opportunity to right some wrongs. It wouldn\u2019t cost a great deal of money per individual.\u201d\nOnce a soldier was demobilised, Britain paid him a lump sum known as a war gratuity, calibrating the exact amount to the racial hierarchy enshrined in its African empire.\n\u201cWhen I got out, they gave me nothing,\u201d said Eusebio Mbiuki, a 100-year-old veteran who lives in poverty in rural Kenya, having endured brutal combat in the jungles of Burma while fighting for Britain. \u201cThey should have known how much we had helped them. They would have given something. But that was not the case. We were abandoned just like that.\u201d\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, Britain recruited African men \u2014 forcibly in numerous cases \u2014 to protect its colonies on the continent and further afield. During the second world war, these soldiers bolstered Allied forces to defeat the Italians in the Horn of Africa, to capture Madagascar from the Vichy French and to fight Japan\u2019s imperial forces in desperate conditions across Burma.\nDespite their sacrifices and harrowing deployments, the British government denied these African soldiers equal treatment. The Al Jazeera investigation, due to be aired on Wednesday night , reveals that a white private could earn 10 shillings for each month of service, compared with just three-and-a-half shillings on offer to a black soldier of the same rank.\nFor each white corporal, Britain put his war gratuity at 12 shillings per month of service, and just four shillings per month for black corporals. Each payment was made by Britain\u2019s various colonial administrations, setting the figure in consultation with the War and Colonial Offices in London.\nRewards were even more abysmal for Africans recruited as labourers, even though these supposed non-combatants regularly found themselves in the firing line. Privates, corporals and sergeants in this labour corps could respectively receive two, two-and-a-half and three shillings per month of service \u2014 around one fifth of the amount given to white soldiers.\nBritain\u2019s racial discrimination extended to Asian personnel recruited in British east Africa too. Irrespective of rank, these troops all earned seven-and-a-half shillings for each month of enlisted service: less than their white comrades, more than their African ones.\nThe former chief of the UK armed forces, General Lord Richards, shows a photograph to children in northern Zambia during a visit to the last battleground of WWI in Africa. Photograph: Jack Losh\nA former chief of the UK armed forces, Gen Lord Richards, condemned the neglect of these soldiers following their service in the British army.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who fought for us in the most horrendous circumstances,\u201d he told the film-makers. \u201cSurely if Britain and the British people mean anything, it\u2019s about generosity of spirit and I feel our political leadership sometimes doesn\u2019t remember that.\u201d\nRichards added: \u201cWe should be ashamed that veterans who fought for our country are living in that poverty \u2026 It\u2019s not too late. We can still make amends.\u201d\nPrince Harry attends a meet-and-greet with war veterans and war widows at Burma Barracks in Lusaka, Zambia. Photograph: Jack Losh\nMordaunt, whose department, through UK aid, has supported some Commonwealth veterans and their widows who live in extreme poverty, conceded that Britain\u2019s colonial-era forces had faced significant discrimination.\n\u201cThere were obviously tremendous inequalities in how people were treated,\u201d said the cabinet minister, who last November announced a new aid package to help impoverished veterans and war widows from Commonwealth nations. \u201cClearly there were prejudices that existed many years ago, that were very prevalent at the time, that were causing people to be treated very differently \u2013 people not to be appreciated for the service that they gave.\u201d\nPreet Gill, the shadow international development minister, backed calls for the government to compensate surviving veterans: \u201cThe prime minister has to come back to the House, acknowledge that this exists, apologise for it, and set out what she\u2019s going to do. She has a duty on behalf of the country to come out and recognise this. Any person leading our country has to do this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how many years later. It\u2019s only been 70 years and these men are still alive. She needs to meet with them and their families and acknowledge what this actually means for them. They weren\u2019t able to do anything in that time to raise their voice.\u201d\nMenzies Campbell, a former Liberal Democrat leader and defence spokesman, said: \u201cA life is a life, for God\u2019s sake. Any life is worth the same value, \u2026 If those who served our country are in poverty now then surely there is time to recognise that their sacrifice and their service was of equal value as anyone else in the British army. They deserve both recognition and recompense now. Viewed from today, the distinction was wholly unjustified.\u201d\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is indebted to all those servicemen and women from Africa who volunteered to serve with Britain during the second world war. Their bravery and sacrifice significantly contributed to the freedoms that we all enjoy today.\u201d\nForgotten Heroes of Empire, a film by Jack Losh and Alessandro Pavone, will air on Wednesday on Al Jazeera English at 10.30pm\n\u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019. An earlier version said the Department for International Development was responsible for the welfare of Commonwealth veterans. This is not the case, though the department, through UK aid, has supported some veterans and their families.\n}}

{{NICOSIA (Reuters Life!) - Archaeologists in Cyprus have discovered what could be the remains of a garrison used by Phoenician soldiers in an ancient city founded by a hero of the Trojan war.\nBuildings overlooking a previously discovered Phoenician complex more than 2,000 years old were found at the ancient city of Idalion, the island\u2019s Antiquities department said on Friday.\nThe complex, linked by a tower, were found to discover metal weapons, inscriptions and pieces of a bronze shield.\n\u201cThe complex may have been used by the soldiers who guarded the tower,\u201d the department said in a news release.\nIdalion was founded by Chalcanor, a descendant of Troy\u2019s King Priam, according to the Antiquities department.\nThe earliest remains of human occupation in the area date to 7,000 B.C.\nPhoenicians captured the city in the middle of the fifth century B.C, and governed it for 150 years.\nThe wider complex, believed to be either a palace or administrative center, is considered to be the largest identified so far in Cyprus.

{{U.S. Army generals suggested the M113 will remain in the inventory -- and inside the wire -- for another decade until the Vietnam-era tracked vehicle is retired.\nThe question of the M113 and its planned replacement, known as the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, or AMPV, was on the minds of soldiers this week in Huntsville, Alabama, where the Association of the United States Army, an Arlington, Virginia-based advocacy group, held its annual winter conference.\nOne participant asked a panel of generals, \u201cWhat vehicle will be providing the troop transport, mission command, and medical evacuation treatment missions that were the M113 missions, given that the AMVP won\u2019t come online until the late 2020s?\u201d\nLt. Gen. Anthony Ierardi, the Army\u2019s deputy chief of staff for finance and contracts at the Pentagon, didn\u2019t respond by naming a specific vehicle, such as the mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, family of trucks, used in lieu of the M113 during the recent war in Iraq.\nHe said, \u201cCommanders will obviously task organize and use the most appropriate sets for the missions that they have, 113s are obviously still in units, but it is the intent of the Army to eventually divest those 113s and transition to the AMPV for the protective mobility of our soldiers in the theater of wherever the missions are occurring.\u201d\nThe aging armored personnel carrier was developed in the late 1950s and used heavily during the war in Vietnam. While upgraded versions of the vehicle remain in service, they\u2019re no longer used outside the wire due to their vulnerability to roadside bombs. Commanders won\u2019t allow them to leave forward operating bases without significant mission protection and route clearance.\nThe Army plans to spend $10 billion to buy 2,907 AMVPs to replace its remaining fleet of M113s, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report. In December, the service awarded a research and development contract to the U.S. subsidiary of British defense giant BAE Systems Plc, which also makes the M2\/M3 Bradley tracked vehicle that began replacing M113s in the 1980s.\nThe initial phase of the agreement is valued at $382 million over four years to build 29 prototypes. Once the vehicles are tested, the company would be eligible for an option to build 289 production models under low-rate production for a total contract value of $1.2 billion. The remainder would be built under full-rate production deals.\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. backed out of the competition after concluding the requirements were biased toward a Bradley-style vehicle. The company had instead pushed for the Army to pursue a mixed fleet that includes medical evacuation versions of its Stryker wheeled vehicle. The ambulance platforms were tested in Iraq in 2010 with 3rd Infantry Division units.\nIronically, in his response to the M113 question, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, commander of U.S. Army Europe, touted the benefits of modified wheeled platforms, specifically for medical evacuation.\nWhen the head of the Ukrainian army, Lt. Gen. Anatoliy Pushnyakov, visited U.S. Army Europe\u2019s headquarters in Wiesbaden last week, Hodges said he asked him what equipment lessons he learned in the recent fighting.\n\u201cOne of the interesting things he talked about was the modifications they had made to the BTR,\u201d Hodges said, referring to the eight-wheeled vehicle the Ukrainian army has used for decades. \u201cThey were not prepared for the casualties that they were receiving. They\u2019ve had hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers die of wounds.\u201d\nHodges said, \u201cWhat he described that they have now looks almost identical to what the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps and most Western armies enjoy, which is pushing medical capability well forward. And one of the specific things he talked about was taking a BTR and turning it into an armored ambulance because they used to just try and drag out all the way back to the hospital somewhere, but instead they adapted to the equipment that they have and it\u2019s making a huge difference.\u201d\nMost of the remaining M113s are used by armored brigade combat teams for support roles, including medical evacuation and treatment, mission command and general purpose. The Army hasn\u2019t yet decided how it will replace the carriers located in higher-echelon units.\nLike Ierardi, Hodges didn\u2019t specify a potential M113 alternative and instead joked about his experience in one of the vehicles decades ago at U.S. Army Garrison Hohenfels in Germany.\n\u201cAmerican soldiers have forever made the best use of the equipment we've been given and the 113 is a great example of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI skillfully rolled one at Hohenfels 34 years ago and lived to tell about it -- which proves were not a zero-defect Army.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make great use of the 113 as long as that\u2019s part of the equipment set. And then whatever the Army provides us, great soldiers will make the best out of them.\u201d\n}}

{{By Vishakha Amitabh Hoskote\nFor once, there seems to be a peaceful transition in the Pakistan Army with General Raheel Sharif relinquishing command on 29th November. (The issue of transition was written in an earlier analysis, here and here).\nLieutenant General Qamar Javed Bajwa is slated to take over; obviously the media is rife with stories and conjectures as to what propelled the General\u2019s appointment superceding three senior officers. That it is Pakistan we speak of, gives added curry flavor; Pakistan has had a long history of military dictatorships and it is a well known fact that the Chief of Army is potentially more powerful than any civilian government occasionally in power. With the world\u2019s sixth largest standing army in troop strength, Pakistan has been the media\u2019s favorite child, what with impediments to civilian and democratic supremacy, nuclear proliferation, its connivance in Afghanistan and the spread of global terrorism, and its entire history of sucking American funds to use them against its bete-noire, India, making it a widely covered \u2018banana republic\u2019.\nThe facts and what we can make out of them: What do we know of General Bajwa?\nThe General officer is from the 1980 batch of the Pakistan Military Academy, commissioned in to the Baloch Regiment, which has produced three former Chiefs. His predecessors have been Generals Yahya Khan (Chief, Martial Law Administrator and President), Aslam Beg and Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. Though in itself it may mean little, but the fact of having a Baloch connect may mean something given the problems which have resurfaced in that frontier province of late.\nFor people familiar with the nuances of \u2018qaumi\u2019 (or sectarian, race or culture based) units in the sub-continental armies, it should be self explanatory. For those not familiar with the term, \u2018qaumi\u2019 units comprise of troops from a particular sect or clan, usually considered martial in nature. The term can be attributed to the way the British recruited for their armies, and these considerations worked in their favor in order to control clan based ambitions and\/or rebellious traits. The system of recruitment continues to flourish even today, and an officer from a \u2018qaumi\u2019 unit would have immense say over the opinions of the elders (who would also have served under him) and therefore over the broad view in the community. Whether that is a reason for the rise of General Bajwa is debatable, but quite possibly a substantial reason behind the decision.\nProfessionally, the General has been put through the paces at the Canadian Forces Command and Staff College, Toronto, at the Naval Post Graduate University, California and at the National Defence University, Islamabad. These are courses at different levels of army hierarchy marking out their proficiency to command troops. The gamut of courses would not be considered top-of-the-line, for instance one of the other contenders is from the Royal College of Defence Studies or RCDS, UK. However they do give him the requisite qualifications for the job and yet, make him slightly more pliable.\nThe General has served as a Brigade Commander in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo, MONUC\/ MONUSCO. He has been the Commandant of the Infantry School at Quetta, a training establishment. He has been the Force Commander of Northern Areas which include the territories of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Gilgit- Baltistan, illegally annexed by Pakistan from India in 1947. He has commanded the Pakistan 10 Corps, deployed along the Line of Control with India, usually considered most important considering Pakistan\u2019s obsession with the K word. Prior to his appointment as Chief, the General was heading the Training and Evaluation Directorate at General Headquarters Rawalpindi. In all, he seems to have an equitable mix of operational and training commands. Again he may carry a chip on his shoulder which is useful to be exploited to the advantage of the political establishment.\nThree officers have been superceded namely Lieutenant General Ishfaq Nadeem who commanded the Multan based 2 (Strike) Corps or the Army Reserve South, Lieutenant General Javed Ramday who commanded the Bahawalpur based 31 Corps and Lieutenant General Zubair Hayat, also a former 31 Corps Commander, Director General of the Strategic Plans Division and lately Chief of General Staff. To the credit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s political acumen, he has simultaneously announced the appointment of Zubair Hayat as the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; the four star General post is considered as the link between the government and the armed forces, but is also a notch lower than the all powerful Army Chief in Pakistan.\nGeneral Bajwa seems to be an apolitical officer, which is difficult to believe in the feudal system of Pakistan. He is from the Punjabi Muslim stock which is almost a mandatory requirement to see upper echelons of power in the country. From all accounts, he is a strong proponent of the army not intruding in to civilian space, which is another metaphor for \u2018playing safe\u2019. To that end, it makes good political sense for an already embattled Nawaz Sharif to appoint him as a safer option and hopefully a more pliant one.\nWhat prompted the appointment and what we can expect from the new Chief\nIn the Pakistani narrative, only two tenets remain permanent. First, its ability to keep the US on its right side, and second, its relentless pursuit of Kashmir and India\u2019s downfall. These tenets have formulated both its domestic as well as its foreign policy. It really does not matter whether a civilian or military government rules, what matters is that these two guiding principles are adhered to; without either, the state of Pakistan would succumb to internal dissension or to economic breakdown.\nIf that be the precursor, the General heading the army would indeed be imprudent to ignore both these facets. In the recent past a number of accusations relating to Pakistan\u2019s nexus with terror outfits have been made, notably in the US. This is threatening to the notion of Pakistan continuing to extract funds based on fallacy and may spell the beginning of its economic breakdown. Hence it was of utmost importance to project to the world that a lawful system based on civilian control was in place and is the basis of any decision. The decision to not grant an extension to General Raheel Sharif, and thereafter appoint an innocuous General as Chief, meets this requirement beautifully. After all, perception management has been taught in the Pakistani military establishment since 1949!\nNawaz Sharif would also have to look in to the internal political dimensions to retain his tenuous hold on power. The Balochi antecedents of the General help him to keep a lid on Baloch insurgency and opinion. The fact that he is a Punjabi Muslim helps. In order to keep the military on board it certainly makes sense to have a pliable Chief of Army.\nWith all these factors in mind, the appointment of Chief seems to be very well orchestrated. Along with that comes the question of what the General\u2019s own views portend. As mentioned earlier, he has expressed the need to keep army from intruding in to civilian space. As per reports in the Pakistani media, he has also remarked on terror being a greater threat than India. Both these statements are as politically correct as can be. There has been growing clamour for Pakistan to adhere to democracy and institute measures for the supremacy of civilian control over its military establishment. Links to the terror machinery across the globe having been immutably affiliated to Pakistan, it has been stridently demanded that the country take punitive action against the perpetrators of terror operating from its soil. So a Chief of Army making just these two policy oriented acknowledgements might well be too politically correct to be true.\nAgain reverting to the raison-detre of the Pakistani state, its territorial dispute with India, General Bajwa is not going to make any meaningful departure from the cause. To keep the Indian behemoth bleeding, Pakistan has no alternative but to continue its strategy of \u2018a thousand cuts\u2019; hence, export of terror will not change as an instrument of state policy. Add to that the dimension of an increasingly radicalized Islam. Pakistan will continue to protect terror outfits operating from its soil and it will also keep on paying lip service to the \u2018war against terror\u2019. It would take an erudite intelligentsia across the globe to recognize intentions and institute rational and cognitive steps to stop that.\nAnd while the General may seem relatively meek at the moment, it would be prudent to remember the appointment of General Pervez Musharraf. History might repeat itself at some time in the near future.\n}}

Daniel Davis argues that not only is the war in Afghanistan not going well, but also that his fellow US military officers \u2013 whether due to a misguided \u201ccan do\u201d spirit or a fear of repercussions within their chains of command \u2013 are misleading the American people.\nThis apparent lack of candor, in turn, is creating what Davis calls a \u201ccredibility gap,\u201d making it impossible to allow US citizens and lawmakers to \u201cdecide if the risk to blood and treasure\u201d inherent in America\u2019s wars is \u201cworth it.\u201d\nPublished Sunday in Armed Forces Journal, produced by Gannett, \u201cTruth, lies and Afghanistan: How military leaders have let us down\u201d begins with Davis emphasizing that, upon his arrival in Afghanistan in late 2010, he was \u201csincerely hoping\u201d to learn that Pentagon officials\u2019 consistent claims \u2013 \u201cthat conditions in Afghanistan were improving, that the local government and the military were progressing towards self-sufficiency\u201d \u2013 were true.\n\u201cI did not need to witness dramatic improvements to be reassured,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut merely hoped to see evidence of positive trends, to see companies or battalions produce even minimal but sustainable progress.\u201d\nInstead, \u201cI witnessed the absence of success on virtually every level.\u201d He cites the inability of Afghan soldiers and police to handle security in many parts of the country, and the continued widespread influence of the Taliban.\n\u201cI\u2019m hardly the only one who has noted the discrepancy between official statements and the truth on the ground,\u201d he says, citing a 2011 report by an Afghan organization which noted that US military assessments routinely differ from those of other international military forces in the country and are \u201csolely intended to influence American and European public opinion ahead of the withdrawal.\u201d\nDefense analysts outside the Pentagon, for their part, have long grappled with disparities between official intelligence assessments and what they hear behind closed doors, but some argue that the tendency to \u201cspin\u201d is getting worse as US forces prepare to leave. \u201cSince June 2010, the unclassified reporting the US does provide has steadily shrunk in content, effectively \u2018spinning\u2019 the road to victory by eliminating content that illustrates the full scale of the challenges ahead,\u201d writes Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a piece cited by Davis.\nLast week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) of California, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, noted just such a gap, saying during a hearing that she was \u201cconcerned by what appears to be a disparity\u201d in public testimony among Pentagon leaders about progress in Afghanistan and \u201cthe bleaker description\u201d in classified intelligence reports.\nRather than deliberately mislead, military officers tend to emphasize the can-do spirit expected of career soldiers rather than problems that could be jeopardizing the war effort, when they are asked to speak publicly, some analysts note. Others may worry of the career-curbing impact of delivering news that those in power may not want to hear.\nIn many cases, US military leaders of the current wars have internalized a troubling lesson from Vietnam, argues Army Col. Paul Yingling: \u201cIf you can\u2019t speak the truth, speak in truisms.\u201d\nYingling, who wrote \u201cA Failure in Generalship,\u201d a widely regarded and widely discussed 2007 Armed Forces Journal article, cites his picks for the top truisms of the Afghanistan war:\nWe\u2019re making progress, though it\u2019s uneven and uncertain.\nThere will be setbacks and hard fighting ahead.\nOur hard-won progress is fragile and reversible.\nThe next six months are critical.\nThese oft-repeated phrases tend to produce eye-rolling among many who follow the war, because they have come to mean so little. \u201cThere are almost no conceivable circumstances in which they would not be true,\u201d notes Yingling, in an e-mail. \u201cNo matter what happens, a senior leader can point to one of these truisms and claim, \u2018I warned you.\u2019 \u201c\nMore troubling is that such truisms \u201cjustify continued fighting while minimizing the likelihood of anyone being held accountable for the results of such fighting,\u201d Yingling adds.\nFor his part, Davis concludes in his article that a lack of candor is not patriotic, but rather ultimately does a disservice to the United States. When it comes time to decide whether to go to war \u2013 or whether to continue one \u2013 \u201cour senior leaders have an obligation to tell Congress and American people the unvarnished truth,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat is the very essence of civilian control of the military. The American people deserve better than what they\u2019ve gotten from their senior uniformed leaders over the last number of years.\u201d\nThe Pentagon has declined to comment on Davis\u2019s article.\n}}

{{|PIC1|The Salvation Army has greeted the publication of a new consultation paper that has sought to propose that victims of human trafficking should be allowed automatic permission to remain in Britain rather than being deported.The Salvation Army has continued to voice its opposition to current legislation regarding the victims of human trafficking. Currently those who are forced into prostitution against their will are only looked upon on a case-by-case basis, and have no specific rights to remain in Britain once the authorities find them.However, the latest proposals released by the Home Office has suggested that victims may be given special residence permits.Government ministers are currently negotiating about offering an automatic \u2018reflection period\u2019 that would allow victims to stay in the UK temporarily until they decide whether or not to offer help to the authorities to prosecute the workers in the trafficking rings.|QUOTE|Although the Salvation Army has increased its efforts to pressurise the government in Britain to help victims of human trafficking, the Christian organisation has also been fighting against the issue on a worldwide level also.Commissioner Helen Clifton, The Salvation Army\u2019s UK President of Women\u2019s Ministries, said, \u201cWe have been looking forward to the publication of this consultation document and The Salvation Army will be making a full response to this. We see the proposal for automatic permission for trafficked women to stay in Britain as a positive step which could help prevent women from being re-trafficked and may support those women who chose to give evidence in order to make convictions.\u201cWe remain particularly concerned about the welfare of children and vulnerable women who are trafficked into this country for sexual exploitation and we are exploring ways in which we can support them.\u201d|TOP|The issue of human trafficking has come to the forefront of international issues over recent years, as it is now known to be the second largest illegal industry in the world behind only the drugs trade, according to the Salvation Army.The Salvation Army has expressed that it will continue its efforts to fight the problem across the globe. For example in the Philippines more than 50,000 children have been forced into prostitution, and to fight this huge crisis the Salvation Army is running an education and awareness programme. In addition, the organisation is operating safe homes for children that have been rescued from the illegal industry.The Salvation Army comments that it is also already operating similar projects to this in sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe as well as the South Pacific and East Asia.\n}}

{{Tired of doing sit ups? The Army is rolling out a whole new physical fitness test across the force in coming years that changes the game completely.\nDing dong, the Army Physical Fitness Test is almost dead.\nYes, a new fitness test is here, but don\u2019t panic: It\u2019ll be a couple more years before you\u2019re taking it for the record.\nArmy officials unveiled a new gender- and age-neutral PT test on Monday, and it\u2019s set to replace the run\/sit-ups\/push-ups protocol that soldiers have known and hated for the past four decades.\nThe new test is expected to be rolled out by late 2020.\nThe reason for that, the head of the Center for Initial Military Training told Army Times in a Friday phone interview, is an upcoming year-long field study to determine how to grade the new six-event Army Combat Fitness Test, and how it will affect personnel policies like promotions and separations.\nThat study will begin this October, Maj. Gen. Malcolm Frost said, bringing the new regimen to about 60 battalions across every unit type in the Army.\n\u201cThis is a generational, cultural change in fitness for the United States Army, and will be a cornerstone of individual soldier combat readiness,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThat\u2019s how big this is for the Army.\u201d\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\nA Fort Bragg soldier participates in a trial for the pilot Soldier Readiness Test. Lessons learned informed the Army Combat Fitness Test, which begins a field study later this year. (Sgt. 1st Class Twana J. Atkinson\/Army)\nThis is what the test will look like:\nDeadlift between 120 and 420 pounds, depending on the individual soldier. You must do three reps in five minutes.\nTwo-minute rest.\nStanding power throw. You\u2019ll be required to toss a 10-pound medicine ball overhead and backward. You\u2019ll have three minutes to make one practice throw and two for a grade. The longest distance is recorded.\nTwo-minute rest.\nHand-release push-ups. You lower your chest to the floor and lift your hands off the ground between each rep. You\u2019ll be required to do the most reps in three minutes.\nTwo-minute rest.\nSprint-drag-carry. In four minutes, you will go 25 meters out and 25 meters back five times. Each iteration will include a different activity: sprint, drag a sled, run a lateral shuffle, carry two 40-pound kettle bells, then sprint again.\nTwo-minute rest.\nLeg tuck. You will be required to hang from a pull-up bar and with your body parallel, then pull knees to your elbows for as many reps as possible in two minutes.\nFive-minute rest.\nTwo-mile run on a track or a paved, level road, with a 20-minute maximum.\nAll told, the ACFT predicts with 80 percent accuracy whether a soldier will be effective in combat, Frost said, compared with 40 percent for the APFT.\nThe new test\u2019s work-to-rest ratio is also three times that of the APFT, which was generally broken up in a sit-ups and push-ups portion and a long break before the run. Now, there will be a continuously running clock with a 50-minute limit.\n\u201cAs we look at, at least maintaining, if not gaining, overmatch with our competitors ... this test will allow us to do that from a physical standpoint with our soldiers,\u201d Frost said.\nAnd though this is the PT test\u2019s first total overhaul in 38 years, he told reporters on Monday, it\u2019s not the first change to the Army\u2019s fitness requirements.\n\u201cPT standards have been changed six times,\u201d since the APFT was rolled out in 1980, he added.\nThe long road\nThe Army has been working on a new PT test of record for six years, Frost said, starting with a baseline soldier readiness requirements study. The effort had a false start in 2013, when the service scrapped a prospective test after completing a pilot.\nBut the idea didn\u2019t go away. The service unveiled the Occupational Physical Assessment Test in early 2017, a relatively basic four-event test that recruits now have to pass to determine if they can join the Army, and what kind of job they can do once they\u2019re in.\nBy 2017, it was on to the next step, when Training and Doctrine Command and Army Forces Command were tasked to each come up with a test that built on the occupational nature of OPAT for soldiers in combat.\nThey had freedom to design the what and how, while creating a regimen that tested multiple domains of fitness \u2015 where the APFT had, to much objection from fitness experts, only measured cardiovascular and muscular endurance.\nWhat they created rounds all of the bases, from endurance to muscular strength, explosive power, speed, agility, flexibility and balance. The events were meant to simulate movements under fire, loading heavy weaponry and dragging casualties to safety, among others.\nTRADOC developed the Army Combat Readiness Test, which looks very much like what\u2019s now the ACFT, while FORSCOM piloted the Soldier Readiness Test.\nThis is the Army\u2019s toughest PT test yet \u2014 and trials are now underway The Soldier Readiness Test, a three-phase, seven-event test that Army Forces Command is developing to measure unit combat readiness, is one of two new physical fitness tests the Army is evaluating.\nThe SRT was marketed differently, as a test to be given at a commander\u2019s discretion and for his or her own awareness, rather than something with individual scoring and potential career repercussions.\n\u201cCommanders have always had the ability to do more physical testing, whether it\u2019s an obstacle course, whether it\u2019s a road march,\u201d Frost said of the decision to stick with an APFT-style scoring policy.\nSRT was also a more field-based challenge using props like sandbags and water cans, performed in a combat uniform and capped off with a trail run in helmet and body armor.\nIn the end, however, senior leaders settled on keeping PT uniforms for the new test, if only to encourage soldiers to incorporate test prep into their daily workouts and prevent any injuries while doing it.\nA soldier with the Washington National Guard positions a 10-pound medicine ball as part of the standing power throw test event during a pilot Army Combat Readiness Test Aug. 4, 2017, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. (Stephanie Slater\/Army)\nLeadership also felt strongly about keeping the run event, despite protestations from some corners that no one runs in combat.\nIn short, a fitness test of record has to test both soldier skills and baseline health, which is where the run comes in.\nAnd while something like a loaded road march could get soldiers huffing and puffing enough to test their lungs and heart, it would take a lot longer than 50 minutes total, Frost said.\nThe next step\nNow that the test itself is decided on, the Army is gearing up to kick off another round of piloting, from October 2018 to October 2019, Frost said.\nFitter, deadlier soldiers: This is how the Army plans to prepare you for tomorrow\u2019s wars Leaders are voicing their support for a push to re-think training and maintenance of soldiers themselves, and to treat them as elite athletes preparing for a high-end fight.\nThere are decisions to make about how to grade the test, for instance, so units from the active Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve will all try it out, with soldiers from every MOS and in every organization from U.S. Army Pacific to Army Medical Command to Army Special Operations Command giving their feedback.\nLikely, Frost said, the test will be recorded on a point scale, the way the current APFT is. And now, rather than categories for gender or age, the scale might be according to MOS or unit type.\nAbout half of the field study units will focus on MOS standards, while the other half will make suggestions about unit type.\nAnd that standard will have to be on top of a rock-bottom score for service in general, with a new policy on whether failure will get you a discharge or force you to reclassify into a job or unit whose standards you can meet.\nThere are also discussions to be had about how this test will incentivize good performance, the way maxing the APFT now can get you promoted more quickly.\n\u201cAll those decisions are going to be made after we look at this data through the lens of the field study,\u201d Frost said.\nAnd during the field study, he said, units will take one APFT for the record, then spend the rest of the year training to take a pilot ACFT, which will not be graded.\nOnce that wraps up in late 2019, the service will have until no later than October 2020 to start running the real thing.\nOne decision that\u2019s already been made, Frost added, is that because there are no age-based standards for this test, field-grade leadership will be held to the same standards as their joes.\n\u201cYou must pass the Army Combat Fitness Test to have the privilege to lead soldiers as a commander or command sergeant major at the battalion or brigade level,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, TRADOC will continue its Holistic Health and Fitness Program. While FORSCOM\u2019s SRT only barely resembles the new ACFT, the lessons learned from the equipment and physical training support provided to units during that pilot will endure.\nStarting later this year, 30 FORSCOM battalions will get a team of experts \u2015 a dietitian, a physical therapist, a strength and conditioning coach, either in uniform or civilians \u2015 to push out the unit PT efforts that will support soldiers in acing the ACFT.\n\u201cPart of the doctrine is at least three garrison exercises and field exercises in domains that allow you to train,\u201d Frost said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the field or you\u2019re deployed, we will have exercises that will be done in the field that will be able to replicate your ability to perform on the ACFT.\u201d\nThe Army is notorious for breaking soldiers\u2019 bodies. But it\u2019s now working on ways to prevent that. The Army is in the middle of a plan to study what makes new soldiers most prone to injury, while putting teams of nutritionists and fitness coaches into every brigade.\nThe hope, Frost added, is that in the coming years, prospective soldiers will train for the OPAT before they join, then transition into a service-wide health culture that emphasizes workouts, recovery, sleep and nutrition, reducing injuries and attrition in the service of building and maintaining combat effectiveness.\n}}

{{SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen\u2019s president ordered the restructuring of some military units on Monday, aiming to curb the powers of a son of former leader Ali Abdullah Saleh and stabilise a country where Saleh\u2019s legacy still looms large.\nYemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi applauds as he watches a parade marking the 22nd anniversary of Yemen's reunification in Sanaa May 22, 2012. REUTERS\/Khaled Abdullah\nState-owned news agency Saba said late on Monday that President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi issued decrees transferring the command of some Republican Guards\u2019 units to a newly formed force called the Presidential Protective Forces under his authority.\nOther units from the elite Republican Guards, which is led by Brigadier General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, the ex-president\u2019s son, were placed under different regional command.\nLawlessness in Yemen has alarmed the United States and top world oil exporter Saudi Arabia, which increasingly view the impoverished Arab state as a frontline in their war on al Qaeda and its affiliates.\nThe president\u2019s decrees also incorporated some army units led by dissident General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who broke away from Saleh\u2019s forces after the protests began last year, into the new presidential force or under regional command.\nAhmar welcomed the decrees and called them \u201cbrave and patriotic decisions\u201d, Saba said, adding that the moves restore unity to the armed forces and improve discipline.\nHadi, who had served as Saleh\u2019s deputy, took power in February after standing as the only candidate in a presidential election. His election came as part of a deal brokered by Yemen\u2019s Gulf neighbours to end the political upheaval.\nRestructuring the armed forces was a major element of the power transfer deal signed last year in Saudi Arabia.\nHadi has promised to unify the army, which is divided between Saleh\u2019s allies and foes. In April, he removed about 20 top commanders, including a half brother of Saleh and other relatives.\nYemen\u2019s northern neighbour, Saudi Arabia, and the United States both backed the power transition deal, partly due to concerns over the expansion of al-Qaeda\u2019 s regional wing in a country next to major oil shipping lanes.\nWashington, which has pursued a campaign of assassination by drone and missile against alleged al Qaeda targets in Yemen, has backed a military offensive in May to recapture swaths of land seized by insurgents in the southern Abyan province last year.\nATTACK\nThe army campaign was hailed as a major victory after Islamist fighters were pushed out in June, though residents and analysts say the militants are simply lying low and waiting for a chance to regroup.\nIn the latest fighting, security forces killed five foreign militants And a local fighter in an attack on al Qaeda target in the southern al-Baydah province overnight, a Yemeni security source said.\nThe operation targeted Abdullah Awad al-Masri, also known as Abu Osama al-Maribi, who ran an explosives factory in the province and was considered to be the most dangerous al Qaeda commander in the province, the source said.\nThe Yemeni Defence Ministry also said security forces killed two Islamist militants and arrested three others during a sweep of Jaar, where a suicide bomber killed at least 45 people in an attack on a wake on Saturday.\nThe attack, the deadliest attack since the army declared victory over al Qaeda in June, appeared to target the commander of the Popular Committees, tribal fighters who sided with the Yemeni army in an offensive against Ansar al-Sharia, a group that swore fealty to Yemen\u2019s branch of al Qaeda.\nDespite losing their base, militants have remain a potent threat. They have staged assassinations and bombings, and attacked a southern village in an effort to regain control of territory for the first time since they were driven out.\n}}

In a directive to soldiers and officers, the army warned the game activates cell phone cameras and location services, and could leak sensitive information like army base locations and photographs of the bases.\nThe military is also concerned that soldiers could download a fake application that impersonates Pokemon Go but could leak information from soldiers' phones.\nPokemon Go players roam streets and buildings holding up their mobile phones and following a digital map to catch creatures that appear on the screen.\nIsraeli civilians are also being warned about the perils of chasing Pikachu and other digital critters in the Pokemon Go game.\nThe Israel Cancer Association has advised players not to go outdoors to catch Pokemon creatures in the middle of the day to avoid excessive sun exposure, and other tips to protect oneself from the sun's rays.\n\"In the game itself, some of the Pokemon snatchers are always with a baseball hat on,\" the association said on its website. \"In the real world too, make sure you wear a hat before going outdoors.\"\nThe AIG insurance company in Israel is taking advantage of the Pokemon craze to market its personal accident insurance policy that covers accidents caused while playing such mobile phone games. Yifat Reiter of AIG said the company has received dozens of inquiries about the accident insurance for Pokemon players.\nIsrael's emergency rescue service Magen David Adom said distracted Pokemon players have suffered moderate injuries.\nLast week, a 15-year-old girl suffered a head injury after she fell off her bicycle while pursuing Pokemon creatures, and a 35-year-old player ran into a glass door and suffered \"massive bleeding\" in his legs, Magen David Adom said in a statement on its website.\n\"Apparently the game is not as friendly as we thought,\" the statement said.\nFor Palestinians, Pokemon Go is a frustrating game to play, because mobile high-speed internet services don't exist in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under interim peace accords, Israel controls wireless networks in the area, and Israel only recently announced that it would allow high-speed internet access in the West Bank, though the technology has not yet gone into effect.\nThe Palestinians are among a few markets in the world that still use older 2G technology, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a U.N. agency.\nNaim Samsoum, 26, a Gaza-based animator, was one of the first people in the territory to download the game. He said he managed to catch three Pokemons only after installing a costly 2G internet service from the only mobile service provider in Gaza.\n\"I stopped because it was very expensive for me,\" Samsoum said.\nHe ran into another obstacle: the fourth Pokemon he wanted to catch was located on the premises of the Palestinian Legislative Council, an off-limits government building run by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza.\n}}

{{Share:\nLAHORE - The political turmoil is going to be resolved after the army chief\u2019s positive mediation first time ever in the country\u2019s history.

Apparently, an acceptable formula is likely to come up today that would provide the winging claims to all the stakeholders.\nPAT chief Dr Tahirul Qadri has a separate agenda. He has not stepped in the electoral politics yet, so he would celebrate his victory for a long time. But all the politicians, including from the government and opposition benches, would badly realise one day that they are on the losing side in the whole episode.\nThough democratic societies are prone to face political crises but politicians show maturity and manage to resolve them amicably, strengthening democracy.\nIn Pakistan, the Parliament House possess a voice but its resolutions gave birth to an atmosphere of confrontation instead of reconciliation. On the other side, PTI chairman Imran Khan\u2019s inflexible attitude was also not different to it.\nAt the same time, the rulers were lacking a team that could show maturity and resolve the political turmoil. In first phase of the crisis, the government was facing a major loss as it was seemingly going to diminish from power after the Sareena Chowk and Red Zone. If the crisis is resolved, it would strengthen the impression that the politicians are not capable enough to settle their difference in political terms. And if the politicians cannot do so than how they would be able to lead the country out of crises.\n}}

{{For former soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who might be toying with the idea of getting back into uniform, the Army has a new offer: Join us and regain your old rank without repeating basic training.\nIt\u2019s the latest twist in the Army\u2019s pitch for recruits at a time when wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are making it increasingly difficult to enlist young people and meet the Army\u2019s need for 80,000 new soldiers a year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d says Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, an Army spokesman. For the cost of mailing a brochure to targeted former service members, the Army can open a door that had been jammed shut before.\nThe Army previously had welcomed back former service members, but only under conditions that made it an unattractive proposition to most, namely that they would lose their prior rank and were required to take basic training again.\nStarting this month, the Army sent mailings to 78,000 people who left the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps less than five years ago, including 7,000 officers, as first reported Monday by the private Army Times newspaper.\nSigning bonuses, too\nThey can re-enter at their former rank if they have not been out of the service for more than four years, and they are eligible for a signing bonus of up to $19,000, depending on their skill specialty, Hilferty said.\n\u201cThere is no higher calling than service in our armed forces, and this is your opportunity to answer the call to duty again,\u201d the recruiting brochure says. \u201cMake part of your past, part of your future,\u201d it adds.\nThe Army hopes that 1,000 to 2,000 of the 78,000 accept the offer, Hilferty said. That\u2019s a relatively small number, considering the Army is aiming to enlist 80,000 this year, after falling nearly 7,000 short last year. But any boost is welcomed by Army officials who acknowledge that 2006 is likely to be a difficult recruiting year.\nFormer soldiers who come back to the Army after less than five years out of uniform can skip basic training and return at their former rank, the spokesman said. Those who come after previously serving in the Air Force, Navy or Marine Corps will also retain rank but must take a four-week Warrior Transition Course at Fort Knox, Ky., which was established under another Army program to convert sailors, airmen and Marines to soldiers.\n}}

Army spokesmen said the IDF tries very hard to avoid casualties, especially among the young.\n\u201cWe have tried so hard to avoid fatalities\u2013and there go our efforts,\u201d said a senior IDF officer.\nTuesday, the 23rd anniversary of the Six-Day War, an army observation post spotted a group of five youths setting a stone ambush for soldiers at an alley, adjacent to the main road, passing by the Askar refugee camp at the edge of the city.\nA patrol was sent in to surprise the youths, who were apparently forewarned and fled the scene.\nAs they fled, a soldier spotted one of them and fired a rubber bullet toward him. The bullet missed the youth, hitting instead 10-year-old Ahmad Salame, who happened to be passing.\n\u201cAs a father, it hurts me that a child died,\u201d said the regional commander, identified only as Col. Amos.\nA CITY REDUCED TO SILENCE\nA few hours later, another shooting took place. An IDF patrol on Faisal Street, the main street of Nablus, spotted four masked men wearing black training suits and holding swords.\nThey began to taunt the soldiers, shouting foul language through a loudspeaker.\nUnder standing orders, the IDF may shoot masked rioters. But the soldiers chose to chase them instead.\nThe soldiers followed them into an orchard in the backyard of a nearby apartment building. One shot was fired. One fleeing figure fell down. When the mask was taken off his face, he turned out to be Rami Kamhiya, age 13.\n\u201cThis is sad, very sad indeed. We can do all the explaining in the world, how we take all the precautions, how we didn\u2019t mean to how we instruct our soldiers.\n\u201cBut in the end, we are judged by the outcome, not by the intentions,\u201d said Col. Amos.\nNabila Abu-Yussuf, a 30-year-old Arab housewife, wanted to know \u201cwhy do the soldiers have to enter our places at all? If they hadn\u2019t come here, there would be no tragedies.\u201d\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s shootings, Nablus seethed with rage. The only way to avoid further bloodshed, the IDF decided, was to place the largest Palestinian city in the West Bank under total curfew, its 13th in the past two months.\n\u201cIt is a difficult choice, between had and worse,\u201d a senior officer said.\n\u201cSometimes we must choose between putting a population of 120,000 people under house arrest, or letting the situation deteriorate to violent clashes.\u201d\nThe latest curfew is expected to last through Saturday, which will mark the start of the 31st month since the Palestinian uprising began.\nNow with the curfew in force, the city is silent except for the motors of Israeli military vehicles patrolling the deserted streets. The only reminder that Nablus is still populated are the faces staring from windows or the few people who dare stand on a rooftop or terrace.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON \u2014 Setting up a brand-new four-star command to try to improve the way the U.S. Army develops and acquires capabilities for future operations is a big deal. Pair that with the service\u2019s relatively abysmal track record in fielding new weapons and there\u2019s bound to be skepticism in the service\u2019s drastic plan to fix a broken system.\nArmy leadership got mixed reactions from lawmakers during a Sept. 13 House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee hearing that ranged from deep skepticism to hope.\nThe new Army Futures Command would put all modernization tasks that \u201cgenerate a war-fighting capability under one roof,\u201d Under Secretary Ryan McCarthy said at the hearing. \u201cThese tasks include war-fighting concepts, requirements, experimentation, and fielding of materiel and non-materiel solutions.\u201d\nThe command was officially activated last month in Austin, Texas. The Army envisions the command as nimble, agile and better able to communicate and work with academia, entrepreneurs and innovators.\nCan Austin make the Army weird? Austin is free-thinking, creative and now a burgeoning technology innovation hub, but can its fearlessness to take risk rub off on the Army as it seeks to develop game-changing technology to stay ahead in battlefield capabilities?\nThe service has argued that establishing a new four-star command is a disruptive and innovative way to address problems of the past.\nBut lawmakers had questions on the roles and mission of the new command, asking upfront \u201cwill it help\u201d in the title given to the hearing itself.\n\u201cThe Army\u2019s past attempts to change internal policies, command relationships and organizational structures in an effort to improve the acquisition process has met mixed results,\" the subcommittee\u2019s ranking member Rep. Madeleine Bordallo, D-Gaum, said in her opening testimony. So I look forward to hearing how you believe it will be different this time,\u201d she said, addressing Army leadership.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\nBordallo said she was concerned that the service was at risk of creating another massive bureaucracy, that it might be duplicating the role of the Army\u2019s staff and that the new command could create \u201clong-term risk to civilian control of the acquisition system.\u201d\nShe added that the four-star command would have up to three lieutenant generals as deputies to the commander \u201cwithout a clearly defined command relationship and an organizational plan.\u201d\nMcCarthy took pains to explain the command is not like anything seen in the Defense Department before. \u201cThis is not your normal Army command. It can\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cTo thrive in the information age, we must operate in a fast-paced, dynamic and evolving ecosystem. We\u2019ll become comfortable being uncomfortable.\u201d\nArmy Futures Command taking charge of conjuring up new capability The Army is closing in on choosing a location and a commander for its new Futures Command as it prepares to stand the organization up this coming June.\nThis means no uniforms down in Austin, Gen. Mike Murray, the new AFC commander, testified during the hearing, and it also means having the ability to get out into communities that can help the Army modernize, whether that\u2019s embedding a group of personnel at an entrepreneurial hub or working alongside engineers at a university lab.\nThe Army isn\u2019t just creating a new command, Murray emphasized; it\u2019s finding a way to get commands to better work together from beginning to end in the acquisition process.\nThe command will be built from existing organizations dispersed across the United States, he said, and will involve everyone \u2014 from requirements developers, to testers, to maintainers and sustainers \u2014 being at the table from the beginning.\nFor example, Murray explained that parts of Army Training and Doctrine Command, like the Army\u2019s Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC), will now fall under the AFC as well as elements of Army Materiel Command and Forces Command.\nThe reorganization helps to better define and focus commands already in existence, he explained.\nMcCarthy added that now TRADOC will hone in on assessing individuals and preparing them for the operational force. FORSCOM will focus on readiness and, by taking out the research and development portion of Army Materiel Command and moving it to AFC, AMC will now be able to look solely at sustaining the force.\nMurray will have a deputy commander, Lt. Gen. James Richardson, but a few other stakeholders within the Army\u2019s enterprise will be direct reports as well, including the military deputy to the acquisition chief.\nMcCarthy said that the acquisition chief\u2019s deputy is being tied to the new command so that he can perform oversight and management of the program managers that are \u201cmatrixed\u201d into the command.\nThe AFC is focused on six major modernization priorities, and cross-functional teams have been created to work on each. Those teams will be tied to traditional program managers to help move development out of science and technology and into soldiers\u2019 hands.\nMcCarthy stressed that the military deputy\u2019s instructions will come from the acquisition chief, as has always been the case.\nSeveral lawmakers asked how the command would know if it is succeeding.\nMurray said that for him, the \u201cultimate metric\u201d for measuring the value of the organization is \u201csoldiers on the battlefield being able to utilize the equipment and concepts we\u2019ll produce.\u201d\nOthers were concerned the new command might take money from basic and applied research to pay for its endeavors.\nMurray assured lawmakers that the Army was preserving that funding and would not use it to cover the development work being done within his command.\nAnd addressing the concern that the command was imbalanced with too many general officers at the top and not enough civilian leadership, Murray stressed that he is working to hire civilian talent, particularly a chief technology officer, that will help the Army recognize feasible technologies that can be realistically pursued and help understand how they can be effectively integrated into capabilities.\nWhile members of the subcommittee peppered Army leadership with skeptical questions, several lawmakers said they believed a move like creating a new command seemed like a good solution.\n\u201cI actually have optimism for it because if you look at where our acquisition process has been, we have a long line of almost hall-of-fame-type failures to show for what has not worked in the last 30 years,\u201d said Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., who served extensively with Gen. Murray in his military career.\n\u201cFuture Combat System, Crusader, Comanche, Land Warrior, melting plastic rifles at Fort Benning that we almost adopted and thank God we didn\u2019t,\u201d Russell listed among the failures of the past.\nBut the Army also saw success in communications equipment development, unmanned aircraft and night vision capabilities, largely driven by the special operations forces community circumventing traditional acquisition processes.\n}}

{{NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- A senior Marine Corps official confirmed today that the service is lockstep with the Army's effort to search for a rifle round more potent than the current 5.56mm round.\nFor months, senior Army officials have been telling Congress that the current 5.56mm Enhanced Performance Round is not potent enough to penetrate enemy body armor plates similar to U.S. military-issue rifle plates such as the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert, or ESAPI.\nAs a solution, the Army is experimenting with a plan to replace its M249 squad automatic weapon and M4 carbine with futuristic weapons that fire a 6.5mm case-telescoped round or something that falls between a 5.56mm and a 7.62mm round.\nThe Marine Corps, which recently decided to buy more M27 5.56mm Infantry Automatic Rifles, has not publically echoed the Army's concern with 5.56mm until now.\n\"We are working the Army; we have looked at the 6.5mm Creedmoor with the Army and [Special Operations Command],\" Brig. Gen. Joseph Shrader, commander of Marine Corps Systems Command, told Military.com at the annual Sea-Air-Space exposition Wednesday.\n\"We are lockstep with them looking at a new round.\"\nShrader, however, said he did not know if the effort would mean a new infantry weapon for the Marine Corps.\nLt. Gen. John Murray, deputy chief of staff for Army G8, told Congress in February that the Army already has a science and technology demonstration weapon, made by Textron Systems.\nThe working 6.5mm prototype has evolved out of Textron's light and medium machine guns that fire 5.56mm and 7.62mm case-telescoped ammunition developed under the Lightweight Small Arms Technology program.\nOver the last decade, the Army has invested millions in the development of the program, which has now been rebranded to Textron's Case-Telescoped Weapons and Ammunition.\nWhile the Textron weapon is \"too heavy,\" Murray said the Army has opened the effort up to industry to come in and develop new prototypes for testing.\nThe Army had planned on fielding a the new Next Generation Squad Weapon by 2025 or 2026, but the service has now accelerated the effort to have some kind of initial capability by 2022 or 2023 at the latest, Army officials say.\n-- Matthew Cox can be reached at matthew.cox@military.com.\n}}

{{The commander of Program Executive Soldier today refuted recent media reports that the Army\u2019s senior leadership has not killed a requirement to field a new 7.62mm Interim Service Combat Rifle capable of defeating enemy body armor.\n\u201cIt is not dead. The decision has not been made,\u201d Brig. Gen. Brian Cummings (P) told Military.com.\nCummings\u2019s comments come a day after The FirearmBlog reported that the Interim Service Combat Rifle competition, which was launched in early August, has been cancelled.\nDespite Cummings insistence, a source told Military.com that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley has decided to cancel requirement, and ultimately the competition, but has not made yet made it official yet.\nThe Army identified a potential gap in the capability of ground forces and infantry to penetrate body armor using existing 7.62mm ammunition, according to the Aug. 4 solicitation.\nThe opening of the competition came just over two months after Milley revealed to Congress that the M4 Carbine's M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round cannot penetrate modern enemy body armor plates similar to the U.S. military-issue rifle plates such as the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert, or ESAPI.\nMilley told lawmakers in late May that the Army does not believe that every soldier needs a 7.62mm rifle. These weapons would be reserved for the Army's most rapid-deployable infantry units.\nThe Army intended to purchase up to 50,000 new 7.62mm rifles to meet the requirement, according to the solicitation.\nIt\u2019s still unclear what changed; why the Army leadership decided to kill the effort.\nIt might have something to do with the U.S. Marine Corps' lack of interest in the requirement and that it has decided to go in the opposite direction. In August, the Corps announced its plans to purchase more than 50,000 additional M27 Infantry Automatic Rifles (IARs), which are chambered for 5.56mm.\n}}

{{Gaza City \u2014 Two Palestinians were killed by Israeli army fire in Gaza in a flare-up after soldiers were wounded by an explosive device along the Palestinian enclave's border, Gaza medical sources said Sunday.\nThe fatalities were identified by the Gaza health ministry as Salam Sabah and Abdullah Abu Sheikha, both 17, who were killed during a strike east of Rafah in southern Gaza.\nAccording to Palestinian eye witnesses, the two were killed by shots near the border.\nThe Israeli army said that its forces had fired \"warning shots\" at a number of Palestinians approaching the border fence \"in a suspicious manner\".\nTheir death comes after Israel launched a series of air strikes targeting 18 targets in Gaza, after the explosive device wounded soldiers and a projectile from Gaza hit in an Israeli border town.\nThe Saturday explosion and ensuing Israeli air strikes marked one of the most serious escalations in the Hamas-ruled enclave since the Islamist movement and Israel fought a war in 2014.\nThe army also reported that a \"launch was identified from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory\", with a projectile hitting near a home in a southern Israeli community.\nAn Israeli police spokesman said the projectile had damaged a building but caused no injuries.\nSpeaking at a security conference in Munich late Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called the Gaza border incident \"very serious\" and pledged to \"respond appropriately\".\nA Palestinian security source said the Israeli air strikes hit three bases belonging to Hamas in the east of the blockaded Gaza enclave.\nTwo Palestinians were injured in the raids, Palestinian medical sources said.\nEarlier in the day, the army said \"two soldiers were severely wounded, one moderately and one slightly\" when an improvised explosive device blew up along the border fence with Gaza.\nNone of the soldiers' lives were in danger, a spokesman said.\nPalestinian security sources said the explosion took place east of the city of Khan Yunis.\nIn response Israeli forces said a tank promptly opened fire at an \"observation post\" in southern Gaza, causing no injuries on the Palestinian side.\nIsraeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said a \"rogue group\" had claimed responsibility for the bomb blast, likely indicating one of the more radical groups who are present in Gaza.\nBut he insisted that \"from our point of view Hamas is responsible\" and said the explosive had been planted during a protest arranged by the group on Friday.\nIsrael holds Hamas responsible for any fire from the blockaded coastal enclave.\nThe Israeli army responds automatically to any strikes on its territory, generally targeting Hamas facilities.\nHamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said it had fired at Israeli jets overhead. Conricus denied the claim.\nHamas and Israel have fought three wars since 2008, and the last conflict in 2014 was waged in part over tunnels from Gaza that were used to launch attacks.\nIsraeli aircraft hit Hamas targets in the southern Gaza Strip repeatedly in early February, saying Palestinians there had fired a rocket into its territory.\nTensions between the Palestinians and Israel have been high since US President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state in December.\nNetanyahu will visit the White House next month, a senior US administration official told AFP on Friday.\nThe March 5 visit comes as Netanyahu faces a scandal that has seen police recommend he be indicted for graft. \u2014 AFP\n}}

{{Last Thursday afternoon, in the town square of Bini\u2019ish in Idleb Province, northwest Syria, a small group gathered to protest against the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. It was drizzling, and the protesters, about 200 of them, were mostly schoolchildren. A group of young men in kaffiyehs soon arrived on the scene. They were carrying a large yellow-and-green flag\u2014the flag of Hezbollah. One of the protesters opened his motorcycle\u2019s gas cap, and seconds later the flag was in flames. The youngsters gathered around the burning flag, whooping, cheering, and chanting slogans against the regime.\nThe flag burning in the main square in Bini\u2019ish distilled in a single moment much of what I saw and experienced in Syria: The men fighting against the regime lack uniforms, a chain of command, and they have little by way of a unifying ideology. But they are fiercely united against Assad and his chief ally, the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSeveral days before the flag-burning incident, on a black night with heavy rain, I had crossed into Syria. I had come to report on the Free Syrian Army, which has emerged as the most significant organization in the Syrian revolution\u2014though it isn\u2019t really an organization at all. It consists of a series of local armed initiatives centered around strongmen of various political orientations. These militias operate according to their own perceived needs, mainly seeing their job as protecting the precarious autonomous zones carved out from the Assad regime in Idleb, Homs, and other areas in the course of the uprising.\nI came by way of the mountains on the Turkish-Syrian border, in the company of a group of Syrian smugglers whose assistance I had paid for. We rode horses laden with contraband in sealed boxes. For parts of the journey, stymied by rough trail, we had to lead the horses by rope. The smugglers moved at lightning speed, almost sprinting up the rocky ascents, and I was worried that I\u2019d fall behind. But we reached Syria safely after a trek of an hour or so.\nAt a small stone house on the mountains just over the border, I met with a contact from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) who was due to take me down into Idleb Province, a deeply religious, conservative, Sunni Muslim region where I would spend the following week in the company of the FSA. The man, in his late 20s, was bespectacled, bearded, and polite, but reserved. His appearance and behavior were familiar to me: This young fighter was obviously a Salafi Islamist. I had heard that there were Salafis\u2014radical Sunnis\u2014among the FSA fighters but was surprised to meet one so soon.\nAn hour or so after, he and I arrived at one of the \u201cliberated zones\u201d of Idleb Province\u2014one of the towns in this part of northern Syria where signs of the Assad regime have disappeared. The flag of the uprising, which is the flag of the pre-Baath Syrian republic, flies over the town. In the course of my time there, I met not a single fighter or officer who considered Col. Riyad Asaad, the nominal head of the FSA who is based in Antakya, Turkey, to constitute the real directing hand of the movement.\nInstead, it is very clear that there is, in fact, no real leader. Armed resistance against the Assad regime has emerged out of the very basic need to protect the Syrian civilian population from their murderous dictator. A united, countrywide armed resistance movement does not yet exist in Syria. Nor do the rebels possess a single, uniting political idea, beyond bringing down the dictatorship. They seemed to be united by something more fundamental: They have all witnessed suffering caused by the regime. A good number of the fighters I spoke with were asked to carry out the violence themselves. The armed men of the FSA and the local civilian leadership of the uprising maintain law and order in the liberated zones of Idleb. It proved a good place from which to observe the Syria that may emerge when\u2014or if\u2014the Assad dictatorship falls.\n***\nMany of the FSA fighters are army deserters with similar stories. Mohammed, for example, a tall, brown-haired FSA fighter from Bini\u2019ish, was formerly a soldier in the Syrian Army\u2019s 9th Brigade. Sent to the southern town of Dera\u2019a to suppress demonstrations in mid-2011, he decided to desert after being ordered to fire live ammunition at protesters. He found his way to the FSA in Dera\u2019a and later returned home to Idleb Province. The reason, he told me, was simple: \u201cI took an oath when I joined the army to protect the people. The people\u2014not the regime. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nContinue reading: Wanting help, \u201ceven from Israel\u201d\nBilal Khabir, the formidable commander of the FSA in the town of Sarmeen in Idleb, abandoned his seven-year career as a member of Assad\u2019s air force to join the insurgency. \u201cThe FSA is the real Syrian army,\u201d he told me. \u201cLaw and justice is with our side, and we will fight to the end.\u201d Khabir, like Mohammed, chose to desert after witnessing the suppression of demonstrations in Dera\u2019a, where the uprising began. In his case, the precipitating incident for joining the FSA was when Iranian officers executed one of his friends when the friend refused to fire on demonstrators. (The presence of Iranian officers alongside Assad\u2019s forces is one of the most noteworthy elements of the regime\u2019s attempt to suppress the Syrian revolution, and it is a matter of particular anger to the insurgents.)\nNot all the FSA fighters I met were army deserters. Some were local, relatively apolitical young men who had decided to join the FSA as part of a more general commitment to bring down the regime. Salafi Islamists, too, formed a recognizable sub-group within the broader ranks of the movement, though I saw no evidence that they dominated or set the tone. The Salafis I spoke to tended not to stress religious or ideological goals. Rather, like the others, they spoke of the cruelty of the regime and the need to destroy it.\nBut the overwhelming characteristic of the FSA is that it is Sunni. There is an unmistakable and strong sectarian element in the revolt against the Assad regime, even though this is something that FSA fighters and opposition activists prefer not to emphasize in front of visitors. They do not wish to be seen as a sectarian militia, but rather as an organization battling a dictatorship.\nYet the fact that the Assad regime now rests almost entirely on the support of the country\u2019s 12 percent Alawi minority is not lost on the Sunni fighters of Idleb. \u201cThis is war between the clans, between the Sunni and the Shia and the Alawis,\u201d a middle-aged civilian opposition activist said to me one evening as we sat drinking tea in his home. But then, a moment later, he corrected himself. \u201cBut the Sunnis reject the possibility of civil war between the clans. We don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n***\nThe FSA fighters may lack a unified political ideology, but they do have a very clear set of shared tactical demands. As Bilal Khabir, commander of the FSA in Sarmeen, told me: \u201cA buffer zone, a no-fly zone, and supply of weapons are the way to victory.\u201d It was a sentence I\u2019d hear again and again from FSA men and opposition activists. The FSA fighters know that unless international help comes in the form of a safe zone, the situation and the carnage could drag on for months or years. At the moment, the FSA has AK-47s, RPG-7s, heavy machine guns, and some mortars. They will need more than this to face down an assault from Assad\u2019s Russian-supplied, modern weaponry.\nThe people I met were also acutely aware that an existing de facto international coalition is the single most important factor ensuring the dictator\u2019s current survival. \u201cRussia, Iran, Hezbollah, and China are against us,\u201d a black-bearded Salafi fighter told me, shortly after he had returned from an attack on an army checkpoint outside Idleb City. When I asked Bilal Khabir to list the elements that had so far prevented Assad\u2019s fall, he answered, \u201cIran and Hezbollah.\u201d Ayham al-Kurdi claimed that FSA fighters had captured five Iranians in Hama.\nAgain and again, I heard stories of Lebanese Hezbollah men operating on the ground with Assad\u2019s forces and of non-Arab-speaking advisers, likely Iranians, deployed with the government forces.\nSo, while FSA fighters may have little coherent idea of what they are for, they have a very clear and detailed conception of what they are against. And if what they are against is first and foremost the Assad regime itself, they are no less clearly and passionately opposed to the regional and international alliance that supports the dictator.\nIran, Russia, and Hezbollah are constantly cited as enemies of the Syrian revolution. Ayham al-Kurdi was clear that \u201cif the revolution succeeds, we will neither depend on, nor have relations with, nor take weapons from Russia.\u201d He also stressed that the Syrian revolution had come to \u201cbreak the dream\u201d of Iranian domination of the region\u2014and more specifically, Tehran\u2019s strategic ambition to create a contiguous line of pro-Iranian states stretching from Iran\u2019s western borders to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThis all sounds like good news for Israel. But while the FSA may be resolute foes of the Iran-led regional bloc, there is little reason to think that the rebels and the broader opposition depart significantly from the usual Arab attitudes toward Israel and Jews. One older activist in Antakya said to me that a plan was under way to divide Syria into ethnic enclaves and that the opposition needed to be aware of this and counteract it. Who was responsible for this plan? Israel, he told me. \u201cZionism\u2019s project is to divide the Arab world,\u201d he said.\nOn a few occasions, I heard plaintive assertions that Assad was \u201cworse than Israel.\u201d Muhya-din, a young opposition organizer in Bini\u2019ish, was more precise in his definition. \u201cThe Israelis kill Palestinians to protect their own people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are Assad\u2019s people, and he is killing us purely to retain power.\u201d One of his friends then said, \u201cThe Israelis do what they do in the name of their God. Assad, however, thinks that he is God.\u201d\nI can think of a number of other throwaway remarks made to me regarding a desire to seek help from anyone\u2014\u201ceven Israel,\u201d said one fighter, if the situation continues. But the general and very clear sense was that Israel was simply not a relevant factor. The fury and hatred was reserved for Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah; the appeals for support were and are being made to the West. From Israel\u2019s point of view, this is probably the best that can be hoped for from Arab opposition movements at the present time.\n***\nI left Idleb the way I came\u2014over the mountains. There were no horses on the way out, and we had to wade through frozen streams and fields of mud. The day after I left, Assad\u2019s army entered Idleb City with tanks, reportedly killing a number of FSA fighters.\nI remember Muhya-Din\u2019s dismissive response when I tried to ask him about his plans for his family and the child that his wife is due to give birth to in the spring, their third. \u201cRight now, I just can\u2019t think about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the victory. Waiting for when we end this regime. After that, I\u2019ll think only about my family again.\u201d\nA Week With the Free Syrian Army On the ground with rebel fighters in Idleb Province, Syria\nJonathan Spyer is a senior research fellow at the Global Research in International Affairs Center, a fellow at the Middle East Forum, and a columnist at the Jerusalem Post.

{{Military officials say the U.S. Army will roll out its new and improved fitness test by October 2020.\nThe Army Physical Fitness Test that soldiers have known since the 1980s \u2014 2 minutes of pushups; 2 minutes of situps; the 2-mile run \u2014 will be retired before the end of the decade. While the 2-mile run will still conclude the assessment, five other events seen as a better predictor of successfully completing combat tasks have been added.\n\u201cThe Army Combat Fitness Test [ACFT] will ignite a generational, cultural change in Army fitness and become a cornerstone of individual Soldier combat readiness,\u201d Maj. Gen. Malcolm Frost, commander of the Army\u2019s Center of Initial Military Training, said Monday. \u201cIt will reduce attrition and it will reduce musculoskeletal injuries and actually save, in the long run, the Army a heck of a lot of money.\u201d\nACFT\u2019s events include:\nStrength deadlift: \u201cWith a proposed weight range of 120 to 420 pounds \u2026 ACFT will require Soldiers to perform a three-repetition maximum deadlift \u2026 and the weights will be increased.\u201d Standing power throw: \u201cSoldiers toss a 10-pound ball backward as far as possible to test muscular explosive power that may be needed to lift themselves or a fellow Soldier up over an obstacle or to move rapidly across uneven terrain.\u201d Hand-release pushups: \u201cSoldiers start in the prone position and do a traditional pushup, but when at the down position they release their hands and arms from contact with the ground and then reset to do another pushup.\u201d Sprint\/drag\/carry: \u201cSoldiers will perform sprints, drag a sled weighing 90 pounds, and then hand-carry two 40-pound kettlebell weights.\u201d Leg tuck: \u201cSoldiers lift their legs up and down to touch their knees\/thighs to their elbows as many times as they can.\u201d 2-mile run.\n\u201cThe current PT test is only a 40 percent predictor of success for performing in combat and executing warrior tasks and battle drills,\u201d Maj. Gen. Frost said, Army News Service reported. \u201cThis test is approximately an 80 percent predictor of performing based on our ability to test the physical components of combat fitness.\u201d\nMichael McGurk, director of research and analysis at Center for Initial Military Training, told ANS that scoring would differ depending on each soldier\u2019s military occupational specialty.\n\u201cThe more physically challenging your MOS, the more you\u2019ll be required to do at the minimum levels,\u201d Mr. McGurk said. \u201cIn 1980, running shoes were relatively a new invention. The Army was still running in boots for the PT test back then.

{{AMHERST, N.Y. \u2014 Army didn\u2019t allow the disappointment from its overtime loss to No. 5 Oklahoma linger into the next week.\n\"We couldn't let that beat us twice,\" cornerback Elijah Riley said.\nThe Black Knights mixed in a few big scoring plays with its ground-control offense to defeat previously unbeaten Buffalo 42-13 on Saturday and get back on track toward bowl eligibility.\nRiley returned a blocked field goal 80 yards for a touchdown and Kevin Hopkins threw a 25-yard touchdown to Jordan Asberry to bolster Army's triple-option offense that gained 281 yards and scored four times on the ground while running up 37:34 in time-of-possession.\n\"When you can get a big chunk play in there it makes it a lot easier,\" Army coach Jeff Monken said. \"It gives you a little breathing room. You don't feel like you've got to go 16 plays, 19 plays, hammering it 3 or 4 yards all the way down the field. It's hard to do.\"\nHopkins, Army knock off previously unbeaten Hawaii 28-21 Kelvin Hopkins is feeling confident running Army\u2019s option offense three games after three games as a starter.\nArmy (3-2) was still able to put together four scoring drives of at least 10 plays and 74 yards, which helped to limit a Buffalo offense that had averaged 40.2 points and 428.8 yards over its first four wins.\n\"We knew they have an explosive offense, so we just wanted to stay on the field as much as possible,\" Hopkins said.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

He also completed 4 of 5 passes for 91 yards and a touchdown after being intercepted on his first attempt. Calen Holt, Connor Slomka, Darnell Woolfolk and Luke Langdon had rushing touchdowns.\nHaving led the nation in rushing last season, Army (3-2) came into the game ranked fourth at 314.8 yards per game while leading the country in time of possession at 40:53.\nArmy rushes for 449 yards, squashes Liberty 38-14 Army coach Jeff Monken knows his Black Knights are a work in progress. At least, they\u2019re headed in the right direction.\nThe Bulls (4-1) took an early lead when KJ Osborn tip-toed down the sideline for a 53-yard touchdown on the fourth play of the game. But they finished with 255 total yards.\n\"We haven't had our backs to the wall like that, down like that and we didn't respond well,\" Buffalo coach Lance Leipold said.\nTyree Jackson had his worst game of the season for Buffalo, completing 10 of 24 passes for 152 yards and a touchdown. Jackson averaged 263 yards over the first four games and was tied for third in the nation with 15 touchdown passes.\nKevin Marks also scored on a 1-yard run to get Buffalo within 21-13 in the third quarter.\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nArmy: Recovering from an overtime loss against No. 5 Oklahoma last week, the Black Knights have a winning record through five games in three straight seasons for the first time since 1984-86. Their five opponents had a combined record of 17-3 entering Saturday.\nBuffalo: Playing before the fifth-largest crowd in UB Stadium history (23,671) after starting 4-0 for the first time since 1981 \u2014 when they played at the Division III level \u2014 the Bulls snapped a seven-game winning streak dating to last season. That was tied for the fourth-longest nationally and one shy of the program record.\nHOBBLED STAR\nBuffalo receiver Anthony Johnson, a preseason All-American, played only a handful of snaps due to a hamstring and did not have a pass thrown his way.\nJohnson was mostly used as a decoy on red zone plays. Without him on the field, the Bulls struggled to find a rhythm in passing game after the first drive.\n\"AJ is a great player but the way this team is, we are not going to make excuses,\" Jackson said.\nMOMENTUM SWINGS\nBuffalo had a chance build on its lead in the first quarter but had a 22-yard touchdown run from Emmanuel Reed nullified by a holding penalty and turned it over on downs from the Army 26 after four incompletions by Jackson, who was 1 of 9 in the first quarter.\nArmy scored on its next two drives, running 23 plays and possessing the ball for 12:39 before Jackson drove the Bulls to the Army 11. But Wunmi Oyetuga rushed up the middle to block Adam Mitcheson's field goal attempt right into Riley's arms, and he raced down field to give Army a two-touchdown lead.\n\"It's awesome when you get an explosive play form the defense or special teams like that,\" Hopkins said. \"We want to score whenever we get on the field but knowing that the defense can make plays and put the ball in the end zone is a great bonus.\"\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\nBuffalo received six votes in last week's poll but is unlikely to merit consideration after falling from the unbeaten ranks. Some of those votes could go to Army, whose only losses have come on the road against No. 22 Duke and No. 5 Oklahoma.\nUP NEXT\nArmy: The Black Knights head into a bye week before traveling to San Jose State on Oct. 13 to finish a three-game road swing.\n}}

{{Conventional wisdom dictates that because only 1 percent of Americans serve in the military, the cultural divide between troops and civilians is the worst it's even been.\nBut that statistic isn't unique to this generation, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told an audience at the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, and it's important that soldiers not only make an effort to reach out to civilians, but that they keep their egos in check.\n\"Most Americans get their view of the military from movies, from the news, hearsay, from watching whatever, rather than personal understanding or connection with soldiers,\" he said. \"In some ways, people say, only 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform \u2014 that's actually the norm in American history.\"\nIt's the result of an all-volunteer military, he said, but service rates have also been very low throughout U.S. history outside of high-draft periods like the Civil War and World War II.\nStill, he added, having a professional military has created a subculture that civilians aren't always familiar with.\nIt's been a topic of countless think pieces, including a book by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\"I believe, Mark Milley believes, the burden\u2019s on us \u2014 the guys in uniform \u2014 to make sure that we really reach out beyond just what\u2019s on the news and TV,\" he said. \"That we reach out to communities and we let the people know who we are and what we do and what we\u2019re about.\"\nAt an organizational level, that can come with community outreach. But not just in the immediate areas around posts, he said.\nRather than Fort Hood soldiers sticking to Killeen, Texas, he said, they should try to get out all over Texas and up to Oklahoma, visiting schools, marching in parades and visiting first responders, as well as bringing students on post to show them what being a soldier is like.\n\"Be seen. We absorb an enormous amount of money from the American taxpayer,\" he said. \"The American people deserve to see what they\u2019re getting for their money, and they ought to get to know their military. And I think the burden of exposing ourselves is on us.\"\nIt's also key, he said, to stay humble about it.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer.

{{Illustrative photo of an Israeli settlement\u2019s civilian security coordinator. (Oren Ziv\/Activestills.org)\nThe IDF grants arrest and other powers to civilians in West Bank settlements and outposts but fails to ensure they are held accountable. In essence, the army has privatized law enforcement.\nPrivatizing the state\u2019s use of force should be a source of concern to us all. Such a process \u2013 and particularly when the powers are transferred to a body with a clear political agenda \u2013 creates uncontrolled militias. This is the process that has occurred in the West Bank due to the army\u2019s policy of delegating some of its law enforcement powers to civilian security coordinators, as discussed in Yesh Din\u2019s new report, \u201cThe lawless zone.\u201d\nThe institution of the civilian security coordinator in itself is not new; it is part of a spatial defense approach that predates the establishment of the State of Israel. This function was formalized in the Local Authorities Law (Arrangement of Guarding), 1961. That law established that the security coordinators and guards were to be accountable to the police or the army. In the West Bank, where this mechanism was introduced by a military order in 1971, is more complex.\nRead the full Yesh Din report here\nThe security coordinators \u2014 and the guards accountable to them \u2014 enjoy quasi-military and law enforcement powers, such as the power to detain or search a suspect and to arrest him if he resists. Despite this, supervision over their actions is remarkably vague. In official terms, security coordinators derive their powers from appointment by the IDF\u2019s Central Command. In practice, however, they are appointed by the settlements in which they work. In official terms, security coordinators are accountable to the army, which grants them their powers and provides training programs, and to military law. In practice, there is not even a single documented instance in which a security coordinator has been prosecuted for deviating from his authority, despite the fact that the new report itemizes a number of documented violations. In official terms, the security coordinator receives instructions from the army brigade; but he receives his salary from the settlement where he operates. The security coordinator is not an employee of the Defense Ministry and coordinators who have filed suits for compensation against the ministry have been unsuccessful for this reason.\nWhile we were preparing the report, the IDF Spokesperson was forced to admit that there is no document establishing procedures for the supervision and assessment of security coordinators, along the lines of the procedures relating to army officers, for example. The Spokesperson also confirmed that it has no information about disciplinary proceedings against coordinators or against members of their guarding units. Yet according to an Operations Division order, the security coordinator bears a \u201cresponsibility to soldiers undertaking a guarding function in the area, including briefing them on their arrival, monitoring the execution of their task, and attending to their welfare.\u201d It is also worth noting that then-deputy state attorney Shai Nitzan stated in an official letter that commander-commandee relations are not applicable to the relationship between security coordinators and soldiers. This claim is contradicted by the experience of many soldiers who have reported such relations.\nThe transfer of military powers to civilians is particularly serious when it is to a group of civilians with a distinct ideological viewpoint, who are motivated by an aspiration to seize additional Palestinian land and who refuse to recognize Palestinian land rights in the West Bank. The transfer of quasi-military powers to an ideological group, some of whom do not recognize the State of Israel and some of whose leaders have called for the elimination of the democratic regime, can only be seen as the army waiving its authority to exercise power. Or in other words \u2013 privatization.\nBeen there \u2013 done that. When the Finance Ministry attempted to privatize Israel\u2019s prisons and build the first prison managed by a private company, the High Court struck down the law. Justice Ayala Procaccia explained that such privatization creates the clear potential for the violation of human rights: \u201cthe private body that receives a governmental authority carrying the potential to violate the core of individual rights is not rooted in the framework of rules of action and criteria that dictate the standards of use of the institution power of authority and guide the actions of state organs. It did not grow up and was not educated in this framework; it is alien to its concepts, and it has never internalized the theory of balances in the use of governmental power.\u201d\nAnyone seeking a practical example of all these defects need look no further than the security coordinators. By the way, we should note that the state is currently attempting to privatize another arm of the law enforcement system, namely the prosecution: it is proposing to employ attorneys from the private sector as prosecutors who will decide whether or not to serve indictments. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has asked the attorney general to halt this further attempt at privatization: responsibility for the penal process must remain entirely in the hands of the state.\nTo sum up: when the state \u2013 and remember that in the West Bank, the Israeli army acts as the sovereign \u2013 transfers any of its powers to use force to private individuals who are accountable not to the army but to their settlement, it damages its own standing, the ability to enforce the law, and above all \u2013 the occupied population whose person and property it is obliged to protect. Accordingly, Yesh Din\u2019s report urges the army to correct this flaw and to appoint security coordinators who are not settlers but officers in the standing army; and to ensure that they are accountable to the army and not to the settlements. In a nutshell: the army should take back its monopoly on the use of force.\nWritten by Yossi Gurvitz in his capacity as a blogger for Yesh Din, Volunteers for Human Rights.

{{WASHINGTON, July 9, 2015 \u2013 Army officials today announced force structure decisions and stationing plans for the reduction of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 soldiers.\nAccording to information from the Department of Defense, the reduction of force structure will occur in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The end-strength reduction of 40,000 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018, and will be accompanied by the reduction of 17,000 Army civilian employees, officials said, adding that the cuts will affect nearly every Army installation in the United States and overseas.\nRedstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, held a news conference at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the local impact of the Army\u2019s announcement.\nAs part of these reductions, the number of regular Army brigade combat teams, the basic deployable units of maneuver in the Army, will continue to decline from a wartime high of 45 to 30 by the end of fiscal year 2017.\nFort Benning, located near Columbus, Georgia, is expected to lose 3,400 soldiers, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports.\nThe Army will convert the 3rd Infantry Division\u2019s 3rd Brigade Combat Team at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the 25th Infantry Division\u2019s 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, into smaller units \u2014 maneuver battalion task forces \u2014 by the end of fiscal 2017.\nBrigade combat teams consist of about 4,000 soldiers; the battalion task forces will have about 1,050 soldiers.\nAdditional Changes\nThe 25th Infantry Division\u2019s 2nd Brigade Combat Team will remain a brigade combat team, but will convert its primary maneuver platform, officials said. Currently a Stryker brigade combat team, it will become an infantry brigade combat team without Stryker combat vehicles.\nAdditionally, officials said, the Army is analyzing a proposal to use the brigade combat team\u2019s current Stryker equipment to convert an Army National Guard brigade combat team in the Pacific Northwest to a Stryker configuration.\nThe Army selected these brigade combat teams for reorganization based on a variety of factors, including strategic requirements and the inherent military value of the installations where they are based, officials said in announcing the changes, adding that the force structure decisions best posture a smaller Army to meet global commitments.\nNecessitated by Budget Constraints\nBudget constraints are forcing the Army\u2019s reduction, said Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, the Army\u2019s deputy chief of staff for operations and plans.\n\u201cThese were very difficult decisions to make as all of our installations and their communities offer tremendous value to our Army and the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, we had to make decisions based on a number of strategic factors, to include readiness impacts, mission command and cost.\u201d\nIf no change takes place regarding sequestration spending caps scheduled to return scheduled Oct. 1, the Army\u2019s end-strength will be further reduced to 420,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal 2019, officials said, resulting in a cumulative loss of 150,000 soldiers from the regular Army \u2014 a 26 percent cut over a seven-year period.\nThe resulting force, they added, would be incapable of simultaneously meeting current deployment requirements and responding to the overseas contingency requirements of the combatant commands.\n-Information issued by the Department of Defense\n}}

{{The Army will increase the number of Sapper Leader Course classes offered each year beginning in October, officials at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, announced Thursday.\nThere will be 15 classes a year, up from the nine offered now. The move will almost double the capacity of the 28-day course, from about 350 students a year to about 600.\nDemand for the Sapper course has increased as the Army has upped the number of engineer positions in its brigade combat teams.\nUnder a massive reorganization that has been taking place over the last two years, each BCT is converting its company-sized engineer element into a battalion of engineers, said 1st Lt. Bryan Wittmeyer, chief of training for the Sapper Leader Course.\nThe newly formed brigade engineer battalions have requirements for leaders who are Sapper qualified, Wittmeyer said.\n\"That generated a need for soldiers and leaders in the regiment to attend the course,\" he said. \"The old schedule was just not producing enough graduates with the skill identifier to fill the force requirements.\"\nFort Leonard Wood's Sapper course, the only Sapper school in the Army, according to its website, annually trains about 350 soldiers. About half of those students will graduate.\nThe additional Sapper classes are expected to increase that training load to between 600 and 650 soldiers, Wittmeyer said.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Students also do urban orienteering, ruck and litter runs, and a road march. They learn water operations \u2013 how to work with inflatable boats and rope bridges \u2013 and mountaineering, including how to move an element through cliffs and rappelling.\nDuring the second phase, the students go into the patrolling phase. This includes a field training exercise and training on technical tasks such as demolition and urban breaching. The second phase gives students the chance to apply what they've learned during the first 14 days of the course, Wittmeyer said.\nTo accommodate the increased workload, the Sapper course will receive five additional instructors, for a total of 24, Wittmeyer said. The detachment also reorganized the way the course is taught, he said.\nIn the past, the instructors were split into two groups; one taught the first phase of the course while the other group taught the second phase.\nUnder the new model, the instructors will be split into four teams: mountaineering, demolitions, threat weapons, and air and water operations, Wittmeyer said.\nEach team of instructors will teach their area of concentration during the first half of the course, then they will serve as graders for the second portion of the course, he said.\n\"Now everyone has to wear two hats,\" he said. \"They're going to be subject matter experts in their field, but they're also going to have to be certified tactical lane walkers for the patrolling phase.\"\nThe Sapper course is designed primarily for 12B combat engineer enlisted soldiers \u2013 a military occupational specialty that earlier this year was opened to women \u2013 and engineer junior officers.\nFor enlisted soldiers, the course is open to sergeants through sergeants first class. Specialists can apply for a waiver to attend, Wittmeyer said. On the officer side, the course is open to first and second lieutenants. Captains can apply for a waiver, he said.\nTo better meet the needs of the engineer regiment, the Sapper Leader Course is also now closed to other military occupational specialties, Wittmeyer said.\n\"We're falling short, so right now the focus is to get those [additional skill identifier]-focused slots filled,\" he said. \"We can't give away the slots that 12Bs need to fill.\"\nThe school could be opened to other MOSs in the future, he said. In the meantime, soldiers from the infantry or Special Forces MOSs can apply for a waiver to attend the course.\nStudents who graduate from the course, which has been open to female soldiers since 1999, earn the coveted Sapper tab.\n}}

(Michelle Lunato\/Army)\nHe\u2019s spent his nearly 20-year career with AMU at Fort Benning, Georgia, and focused his efforts on Bullseye pistols shooting, a precision-accuracy type of shooting done with one hand.\nThat\u2019s the kind of shooting his father Frank Sokolowski got him and the sergeant\u2019s siblings involved with at an early age. And it\u2019s the kind of shooting that got AMU staff to first notice a teenage Sokolowski while he was plinking away at targets at the renowned Camp Perry, Ohio shooting matches.\nHis father first introduced the junior Sokolowski to shooting with a Smith & Wesson .22 LR pistol, a far cry from the custom-built 1911 Colt 9mm he shot for the most recent competition.\nBut the Smith & Wesson is the same pistol that he taught his son, Joena, 15, to shoot with.\nAbout halfway into his career so far, Sokolowski nearly saw it end.\nHe noticed his \u201carc of movement\u201d or how much the pistol was moving as he held it out, was growing. What would be a normal arc, say 3 inches, had widened to as much as 8 inches. Also, there was the pain.\nAfter trying to push through it by doing more shooting work and exercises rather than less, a doctor told him he had tendinitis and he might have to give up the sport.\nInstead, he did something no top-level shooter wants to do \u2013 he switched hands.\nOver months of reconditioning himself, Sokolowski shifted from a right-handed to left-handed shooting.\nLuckily with time, he recuperated enough to return to his dominant hand and when he did more of the action shooting, which is two-handed, the problem didn\u2019t affect him as much.\nU.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Adam Sokolowski won the competition despite doing something no top-level shooter wants to do \u2013 switching hands. (Michelle Lunato\/Army)\nHeading into this year\u2019s competition, which was held in late May, the sergeant was aware that he had a chance to make history.\nHe just didn\u2019t let it get into his head.\nThe best way to understand how the shooting matches work is to think of golf tournaments \u2013 multiple competitors, aiming for the best score on the same course over multiple days.\nIt\u2019s easy to psyche yourself out by watching other shooters\u2019 scores and realizing that\u2019s where the bar has been set.\nArmy Sgt. 1st Class Adam Sokolowski, who won the Open Division and 2018 Overall Bianchi Cup Champion title, said his father taught him to shoot. When he won, he called his father. \"He was ecstatic, he tracks the scores so he probably knows how I\u2019m doing better than I do,\u201d Sokolowski said. (Michelle Lunato\/Army)\nBut Sokolowski took a different approach, doing what he tries to always do \u2013 individualized training such as dry fire drills, followed by record days in which AMU shooters go through the same sequence of shooting events as the match they\u2019re about to compete, which helps gauge where they\u2019re at, score wise.\nThe team shoots five to six action pistol matches a year, so he had a good idea of where his scores were. They were good enough going in to place, but not to guarantee victory.\nAs he progressed through each stage he had an idea he was in the running. Then, on the last event, it started to rain.\nNow, that\u2019s not a big deal in the metallic sights division. But when you\u2019re shooting with an optic and laser, one bad raindrop landing can make that pinpoint laser dot smudge and fill the entire scope with red light, rendering it worthless for precision shooting at high speeds.\nSo Sokolowski used a plastic Gatorade bottle cap to keep the scope dry while he waited to shoot and added a small cleaning cloth to dry the gun and his hands to his normal routine of \u201cShoot-reload-holster-think about what I do-reset.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nerve-wracking but I knew if I just followed my plan, kept my hands as dry as best I can I could do it,\u201d he said.\nAt the end of that last stage, he realized he\u2019d shot all 48 plates \u2026 and that he\u2019d won.\nA short while later he called his dad to tell him he\u2019d won.\n\u201cHe was ecstatic, he tracks the scores so he probably knows how I\u2019m doing better than I do,\u201d he said.\nBut his dad, ever the diehard for accuracy, will still ask how that two-handed action pistol shooting is affecting his son\u2019s single-hand Bullseye shooting style.\nSokolowski\u2019s shooting tips:\nTry the old-school dime and washer drills, those where a shooter places the items on the gun end of the pistol, sight in the target and squeeze the trigger in a dry fire, trying to ensure the dime doesn\u2019t drop. This helps the shooter work on holding steady through the trigger pull.\nA technology-updated way to measure that is to take a 3-by-5-inch index card, draw a line on the card and place it a close distance from the muzzle of the pistol. When using a red dot sight, the shooter would again dry fire the weapon, noticing where the dot goes as he or she squeezes.\n\u201cIf you move a lot, that\u2019s going to cause issues,\u201d Sokolowski said. \u201cThat drill pays major dividends as compare to shooting 400 to 500 rounds at the range.\u201d\nBianchi Cup shooting events:\n}}

{{NEWARK, N.J. \u2014 The U.S. attorney's office filed an appeal of what it called the \"unreasonably lenient\" sentences given to a former Army major and his wife who were convicted of abusing their three young foster children for several years.\nA jury last year convicted former Army Maj. John Jackson and his wife, Carolyn Jackson, on several counts. At their sentencing in December, U.S. District Judge Katharine Hayden chastised prosecutors for seeking prison terms of between 15 and 20 years for them.\nInstead, the judge sentenced John Jackson to probation and Carolyn Jackson to two years in prison, telling prosecutors during the hearing, \"This is not a game. This is not the Giants versus Miami. This is not, 'How many touchdowns can you get?'\"\nProsecutors presented evidence during the trial that the children had suffered broken bones and other serious health problems and were severely underweight and developmentally delayed when they were removed from the family home in 2010.\nAn older sibling testified the children were beaten regularly and forced to eat hot pepper flakes and drink hot sauce as punishment. At sentencing, he told the judge his parents should receive the maximum punishment and deserved to \"suffer just as much\" as their children did.\nOne of the foster children died, but the Jacksons weren't charged with causing his death and it wasn't presented as evidence in the trial.\nProsecutors said the children's abuse lasted for years.\n\"By imposing such lenient sentences, the Court trivialized these offenses, which involved the abuse, neglect, and starvation of three defenseless victims over a five-year period,\" the U.S. attorney's office wrote Thursday.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

They also said the foster children had serious health problems before they joined the Jackson family.\nThe case was brought in federal court because the Jacksons lived at Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility about 35 miles west of New York City, during the time period covered in the indictment. That complicated the sentencing process because there are no federal sentencing guidelines for child endangerment, a crime normally prosecuted at the state level.\nIn its appeal, the U.S. attorney's office argued the judge should have used sentencing guidelines for assault because the endangerment counts on which the Jacksons were convicted included allegations of assault. That presumably would have led to harsher sentences.\nDefense attorneys accused the prosecution of trying to use a backdoor to get the assault allegations in at sentencing when they weren't directly considered by the jury at trial.\nAttorney Rubin Sinins, who represented Carolyn Jackson during the trial, declined to comment on the appeal Thursday.\n}}

{{London: Foreign nationals will be allowed to join the British army despite never having lived in the country, ministers will reveal as part of plans to help stem a worsening recruitment crisis in the armed forces.\nThe Ministry of Defence is expected to announce on Monday that it will no longer require those joining the armed services from Commonwealth countries such as Australia, India, Canada, Kenya and Fiji to have lived in Britain for five years.\nUnder the policy, recruits will be considered for all forces including the Royal Navy and the RAF, with applications opening in early 2019. It is hoped the changes will mean an extra 1,350 people join every year. The army will begin the admissions from early next year, while the navy and RAF will commence the process immediately. Applications from citizens of countries outside the Commonwealth will not be accepted.\n\u201cForeign and Commonwealth troops have historically been important and valued sources of recruitment for the British arm and I welcome the recruitment limit increase,\u201d Mark Francois, a member of the defence select committee, told The Daily Telegraph, which first published details of the plan.\nThe armed forces are short of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel, a report found earlier this year, the worse shortage since 2010.\nThe government allows 200 Commonwealth citizens who have not lived in Britain for five years to apply, a rule introduced in 2016. But now the cap will be lifted. Special rules already allow citizens of Ireland and Gurkhas from Nepal to join the armed forces because of special rules.\nMPs said the move highlighted a crisis in recruitment, taking aim at Capita, the business service provider that runs the army\u2019s recruitment campaign.

It said the air force iswas undertaking more missions than it had for a quarter of a century.\nAnd a Conservative MP\u2019s report in July 2017 warned that the armed forces were \u201chollowing out\u201d due to recruitment issues.\nFrancois described factors leading to a recruitment crisis as the \u201cperfect storm\u201d, citing high employment rates and an ageing population as reasons behind a fall in numbers. He also said an increase in obesity and a rising proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic people \u2014 who he said had until now been less likely to apply for military service \u2014 were also behind the fall.\nFrancois recommended that attempts be made to attract more black, Asian and minority ethnic recruits, as well as getting more women to join.\nRelated: All roles in UK military to be open to women, Williamson announces\nLast month, it was announced that women would be allowed to apply for all roles in the British military for the first time, including in frontline infantry units and the Royal Marines.

{{Expand Mohammed Taher, 50, a Rohingya refugee holds his son Mohammed Shoaib, 7, outside a medical center at Kutupalong refugee camp near Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, on November 5, 2017. His son was shot in the chest before crossing the border from Burma in August. \u00a9 2017 Reuters\/Adnan Abidi\n(New York) \u2013 The Burmese military\u2019s latest claim that its forces did not commit abuses during recent operations against ethnic Rohingya in Rakhine State is contrary to a large and growing body of evidence, Human Rights Watch said today. On November 13, 2017, a Burmese army \u201cinvestigation team\u201d issued a report finding that there were \u201cno deaths of innocent people,\u201d while at least 376 \u201cterrorists\u201d were killed during fighting.\nThe Burmese authorities\u2019 failure to credibly and impartially investigate grave violations amounting to crimes against humanity demonstrates the need for the government to allow the United Nations-appointed fact-finding mission into the country to conduct independent investigations. The military\u2019s grave crimes committed with impunity are exactly what the International Criminal Court was created for.\n\u201cThe Burmese military\u2019s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,\u201d said Brad Adams. \u201cThe Burmese authorities have once again shown that they can\u2019t and won\u2019t credibly investigate themselves.\u201d\nExtensive witness accounts, satellite data, and other sources have shown that Burmese security forces committed widespread abuses during a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslim population. The campaign began following August 25 attacks on government outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). Government forces have responded with mass killings, rape, arbitrary detention, and arson since. Satellite imagery analyzed by Human Rights Watch found that more than 288 primarily Rohingya villages were either substantially or completely destroyed since late August.\nThe Burmese army investigation team, led by the defense services inspector general, Lt.-Gen. Aye Win, said that it interviewed 3,217 villagers from October 13 to November 7, collecting 804 witness accounts. Those interviewed reportedly included \u201cBengalis,\u201d a derogatory term used to describe the Rohingya, whom the Burmese government considers to be foreigners from Bangladesh. There is no indication that the investigators conducted interviews in Bangladesh, where more than 600,000 Rohingya have fled following the beginning of security force operations.\nThe report says that the military acted in accordance with \u201corders and directives of superior bodies, especially the rules of engagement [ROE] in connection with the rights of self-defence and in discharging duties during the armed conflicts and anti-terrorist operations.\u201d It denies allegations that security forces indiscriminately shot Rohingya villagers fleeing their homes, rape and other sexual and gender-based violence, looting, destruction of homes and mosques, and threats to drive Rohingya from their homes. It also denies that security forces deployed \u201cheavy weapons\u201d in its operations, such as grenades and \u201claunchers.\u201d\nThe military\u2019s denials and conclusions stand in stark contrast to the findings of the UN, Human Rights Watch, other human rights organizations, and the international media. In September, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2018ad al-Hussein, described the situation as a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d A subsequent investigation found evidence of arson, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, and attacks on places of worship.\nIn late 2016, Burmese security forces committed widespread abuses against the Rohingya following an ARSA attack on three police outposts on October 9, 2016. A report issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on February 3, concluded that the attacks against the Rohingya \u201cvery likely\u201d amounted to the commission of crimes against humanity. In response, in March the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution establishing an independent international fact-finding mission with a mandate to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in Burma, especially in Rakhine State. Since then, the Burmese government has not granted access to the country to the members of the commission.\nThe Burmese government has since established a number of separate commissions to investigate the violence that erupted in Rakhine State since October 9, none of which have been credible or impartial. A previous army-led investigation into allegations of abuses late last year by its forces led by the same general, Lt.-Gen. Aye Win, found only that two minor incidents of abuse occurred during security operations.\nThe UN Security Council should refer the situation in Burma to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Human Rights Watch said. The Security Council and concerned governments individually should impose targeted economic sanctions and travel restrictions on military leaders implicated in the violence. UN member countries should also pursue processes at the UN Human Rights Council and General Assembly for gathering criminal evidence to advance prosecutions in the ICC and other courts.\n\u201cThe military\u2019s grave crimes committed with impunity are exactly what the International Criminal Court was created for,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe UN Security Council should refer Burma to the ICC, but until that happens UN member states should ensure investigations take place and evidence is preserved for future criminal proceedings. If the Burmese military continues to operate with impunity, we are likely to see future rounds of violence against the Rohingya.\u201d\n}}

{{This article is from the archive of our partner .\nSeveral years and $25 billion later, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey says that nearly half of the Iraqi army is too heavily populated with Shiite fighters to credibly confront ISIS. As Fox News reported, Dempsey made the comments in Paris on Wednesday:\nThe general said that U.S. assessors who had spent the summer observing Iraq's security forces concluded that 26 of the army's 50 brigades would be capable of confronting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\"\nAccording to the AP, Dempsey praised the useful half saying that \u201cthey appear to have a national instinct, instead of a sectarian instinct.\u201d The other half, not so much.\nThe sectarian instinct is what has driven some Iraqis Sunnis to join up with ISIS as Iraq's Shiite-led political leadership marginalized the country's minorities, including the Sunnis and the Kurds. Of course, the sectarian instinct is also at the center of a thousand-year rift between Sunni and Shia.\nThe general's comments came just one day after he suggested that maybe there would be American ground troops in Iraq again someday, a suggestion from which, as we noted earlier, the White House immediately distanced itself.\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\n}}

{{RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u0097 Researchers who flew a drone over the open burning of hazardous waste at an Army ammunition plant in Virginia found arsenic, lead and other pollutants at higher-than-expected levels, according to a draft report obtained by The Associated Press.\nSeveral government agencies collaborated on the testing last year at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, which the state says is the only active military propellant manufacturing center in the country. The plant built in the 1940s regularly uses open burning to dispose of hazardous waste \u0097 a practice that\u201ds legally permitted but has raised concerns among some community members.\nNeither the researchers involved in the testing nor officials that oversee the plant would discuss the report, emphasizing that it is a draft. But scientists and former EPA officials who reviewed its findings said they raise questions about the possible health impacts of the emissions.\nOver two weeks in September and October, researchers flew the drone into plumes while carrying a gas- and particle-sensing system designed by the Environmental Protection Agency, according to the draft report, which AP obtained through an open records request. Its findings were first reported by ProPublica.\nThe researchers found that for the majority of substances, levels were lower than a key measure called an emissions factor. Emissions factors are used in modeling that\u201ds supposed to predict the impact of the burns.\nBut for five substances, the levels were higher. Lead, which the EPA says can affect almost every organ and is especially harmful to children under 6, was found in one type of burn at five times the expected level.\nArsenic, which can be fatal at very high levels or cause abnormal heart rhythm, damage to blood vessels and nausea at lower levels, was 37.5 times higher. Cadmium, silver and chloromethane, which was widely used in the past in refrigerators, were also found at higher-than-expected levels.\nThose elevated levels mean \u201cthe risk posed by these four metals could be higher than predicted,\u201d said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and an expert in air pollution and its health effects.\nBut Marr added more testing would be needed to say whether the levels are high enough to be worrisome.\n\u201cThe drones measured concentrations directly in the plume, but we do not know what they would be at other locations, such as schools and people\u201ds homes, without additional measurements or extensive modeling,\u201d she wrote in an email.\nEric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former director of EPA\u201ds Office of Civil Enforcement, said he found the elevated lead levels particularly alarming.\nHe added that the results don\u201dt mean the Army did anything wrong, but they do mean officials need to take another look at the risk calculations from the open burning.\n\u201cYou can\u201dt ignore that data when you get that much of an increase over what you were expecting, and it\u201ds lead, for god\u201ds sake,\u201d Schaeffer said.\nThe results had initially been promised by the end of 2016, and officials have not explained the delay. A final version is expected later this month.\nThe plant is located on thousands of acres in Pulaski and Montgomery Counties in southwest Virginia, and the New River runs through it. It is owned by the government, operated by defense contractor BAE Systems and is also home to other tenants, including a fireworks manufacturer.\nClose to 7,200 people live within a 3-mile (5-kilometer) radius of the plant, according to EPA data. It\u201ds about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Virginia Tech and about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from an elementary school.\nThe burning is regulated by a permit that includes conditions such as limits on what time it must take place and weather conditions that must be present. The permit expired in 2015, and the Department of Environmental Quality is in the process of renewing it, spokesman Bill Hayden said.\nThe plant was the focus of a recent extensive ProPublica investigation into the environmental implications of the military\u201ds handling of hazardous waste. Citing internal EPA records, ProPublica reported Radford is one of at least 51 sites across the country where the Department of Defense or contractors are openly burning or detonating munitions or raw explosives.\n}}

All local and international surveys were also showing PML-N in the lead, he added.\nMr Hussain said three candidates were in the run for the office of prime minister in the July polls \u2013 Shahbaz Sharif, Imran Khan and Asif Zardari \u2013 and none could deny that of them the PML-N chief was the strongest contestant due to his performance record.\nHe said the PML-N would formally start its election campaign from July 1 and that it would be \u201cneat and clean, devoid of any personal attacks.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t agree to the suggestion that any political party or institution wanted postponement of the July 25 vote.\nAbout the protest against ignoring merit in the award of tickets for seats reserved for women, he said a review board led by ex-Punjab minister Ms Zakiya Shahnawaz with Khwaja Saad Rafiq, Kiran Dar and Nuzhat Sadiq as its members has been formed and hopefully the issue would be settled soon.\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2018\n}}

{{Card slots. A bottle opener. Pepper spray. Defense against a .50 caliber bullet. Whatever you might need on the go, people are thinking of ways for you to integrate it right into your iPhone case.\nBut Y Combinator startup Graft Concepts is trying to cover all your basic needs with one case, using a simple latched frame and interchangeable backplates. Named Leverage, the case\u2019s frame alone is meant to be a bumper for the phone and comes with either a plain backplate for $40 or a card holder (which fits about five cards) for $50. Additional backplates range from $7 to $30 based on design and material.\nThe idea behind Graft Concepts is to offer easy installation and removal, functionality and a complement to the iPhone\u2019s sleek design. Inspired by watch clasps, the metal latch lets you fit the frame around the phone and then click it into place to avoid any damage from snapping or pulling the case. Co-founder Anthony Ko describes the product as \u201ca Swiss army knife\u201d for iPhone cases, because users can switch out backplates to suit their current needs.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t being addressed, like phones being damaged from their cases and being really difficult to take off. So that\u2019s how the quick-release mechanism was developed,\u201d co-founder Peter Szucs tells me. \u201cBecause of the way we do it \u2014 we\u2019re just swapping out the backplate \u2014 we can offer it for less so people can buy more sorts of backplates.\u201d\nThe founders of Graft Concept say the smartphone accessories business is a $20 billion market. But there are many other companies that are either dominant in, or trying to enter, the same space, including OtterBox, Case-Mate and Cygnett.\nKnown for its thick and protective casing, OtterBox is a main competitor in the iPhone case space. As my first and only iPhone case, the OtterBox has kept my phone well intact, but is a little too clunky for my taste sometimes. The white material of the standard case also makes it really hard to clean, which has been driving me crazy.\nOtterBox\u2019s key feature is also something that Graft Concepts isn\u2019t necessarily focused on \u2014 protection. As someone who is prone to dropping things, this is my foremost concern. Although the Leverage case has passed drop tests for protection, the thin frame is nowhere near as hefty or reassuring as my OtterBox. But Szucs tells me Graft Concepts is more about functionality and design.\nThe founders are focusing on personal customization by opening up ideas to the design and 3D community. Graft Concepts has partnered with several sites to offer customization options for backplates, so customers will be able to design their own with Zazzle and COLOURlovers. The company also offers files for 3D printing backplates that work as kickstands and bicycle mounts. Graft Concepts is also working on backplates with a headphone cord wrap and a battery pack.\nThe company has sold 45,000 cases and is in talks with several retail stores.\n}}

All eyes will be on the instant juggernaut that is Warner Bros. Pictures' \"300.\"After its record-setting $70.9 million opening last week, the Zack Snyder-directed film seems to have captured the zeitgeist and didn't lose any steam during the week, boasting midweek numbers unheard of for this time of year. It's likely that the film will drop only 40%-50% during its second weekend as its audience broadens to include older moviegoers and more women.The R-rated, hyperstylized adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel is the first March bow to close in on $100 million in one week of release.\"300's\" unexpected reign might even benefit other studios, as success with one film often ignites moviegoers' passions for other Hollywood fare.Sony Pictures tests that theory with the debut of Mennan Yapo's \"Premonition,\" the Sandra Bullock thriller from the German-Turkish filmmaker that is set to bow in 2,831 theaters. The film stars Bullock as a Midwestern housewife who loses her husband in a car crash only to have him appear in her bed alive the next morning.Julian McMahon (\"Fantastic Four\") plays her husband, and Amber Valletta and Nia Long co-star. The PG-13 film is likely to bow in the low- to midteen millions \u2014 a similar opening to Bullock's most recent wide release, Warners' \"The Lake House,\" which opened to $13.6 million.Fox Searchlight's \"I Think I Love My Wife\" also will fight for a midteen-millions opening. Based on Eric Rohmer's French comedy \"Love in the Afternoon,\" the Chris Rock project debuts in 1,776 theaters.Marking the comedian's second turn in the director's chair, \"Wife\" centers on a married man whose fidelity to his wife (Gina Torres) is tested when a hot young thing (Kerry Washington) comes on to him. The film is likely to bow in the same range as Rock's previous directorial effort, 2003's \"Head of State,\" from DreamWorks Pictures, which debuted to $13.5 million.Universal Pictures bows the horror film \"Dead Silence,\" from \"Saw\" creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Starring Donnie Wahlberg, Valletta and Ryan Kwanten, the story centers on a young widower (Kwanten) who returns home to investigate his wife's murder, only to find his town riddled with corpses. Wan directed the film based on a script by Whannell. The film bows in 1,803 theaters and is likely to open to less than $10 million.In limited release, IFC First Take opens \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\" in nine theaters. From director Ken Loach, \"Wind\" \u2014 which won the Palme d'Or at May's Festival de Cannes \u2014 focuses on two brothers conflicted during Ireland's bid for independence from Great Britain.Starring Cillian Murphy (\"Batman Begins\"), Padraic Delaney and Liam Cunningham, the unrated \"Wind\" has been called anti-British.

The donation is worth about $800.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much better than the chewed taffy we got last week,\u201d said Jerry Gadek, business manager for the Salvation Army of Snohomish County.\nIt\u2019s not certain where in the county the coin was donated.

Two years ago, a $50 U.S. Lady Liberty coin worth about $500 at the time was dropped into a donation kettle in Lynnwood. That coin \u00ad\u2014 believed to be the first \u00addonation of a valuable gold coin to the Salvation Army of Snohomish County \u2014 was wrapped and taped inside a $1 bill. The bill was spotted before the kettle\u2019s contents were combined with the others, Gadek said.

On one side of the coin is a likeness of Paul Kruger, an early president of South Africa and the coin\u2019s namesake. On the other side is a springbok, an antelope native to the country.

At one point Thursday afternoon, it was at $797.10 per ounce.\nDonations of valuable coins to the Salvation Army are not uncommon around the nation, Gadek said. Large donations such as this one are almost always anonymous, he said.\nAfterward, someone usually contacts the organization and pays a good price for the coin, Gadek said. Two years ago, a coin dealer bought the Lady Liberty coin at market value and donated an equal amount to the Salvation Army, doubling its prize.\nIf no one contacts the group this time, it will sell the Krugerrand to a coin dealer, Gadek said.\nThe Salvation Army hopes to raise $150,000 in gross contributions this holiday season to pack food boxes for 500 families and purchase toys for 1,500 children.

{{By IPCS\nBy Sarral Sharma*\nOn 26 November 2016, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif confirmed the appointment of Lt Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as the new Chief of the Army Ataff (COAS). Lt Gen Zubair Mahmood Hayat takes the charge as the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Committee (CJCSC). Gen Bajwa assumes office on 29 November 2016 as the current COAS, Gen Raheel Sharif, completes his three-year tenure.\nThe successful transition of power will boost the confidence of Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government which has seen many ups and downs in its relations with the military in the last three years. The new army chief will take at least two to three months to settle in, to make new appointments and to build his new team. During that period, Sharif will have the window of opportunity to assert a bit more on crucial issues such as improving relations with India. However, it is expected that this time around, Sharif will be cautiously treading the path of restarting any dialogue process with India. This is because even one wrong decision would eventually give leeway to the new army chief to dominate both domestic and international policies.\nSharif is likely to have an upper hand in the coming months as far as the relations with India are concerned. He is expected to move towards resuming the dialogue process with India. It appears that he has already made the first move in that direction. Pakistan\u2019s Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, Sartaz Aziz has confirmed Islamabad\u2019s participation at the upcoming Heart of Asia (HoA) conference, scheduled to be held in Amritsar, India, from 3-4 December 2016. Although the focus of the conference is the situation in Afghanistan, it is possible that Aziz (if he represents Pakistan at the conference) will meet his Indian counterpart on the sidelines of the summit. If the meeting happens, it will be a deja vu moment for both countries. In 2015, India\u2019s Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj met her Pakistani counterpart on the sidelines of the HoA conference in Islamabad, which paved the way for Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi\u2019s surprise visit to Lahore. However, the leadership change in the Pakistan Army will likely to have some impact on the resumption of talks between India and Pakistan.\nThe army chief\u2019s succession may not immediately bring about a major policy change in Pakistan but it could still have important implications on India and Pakistan relations. The change may also hamper Sharif\u2019s efforts to normalise relations with India like it has done in the past. Institutionally, it is Rawalpindi that is in the driver\u2019s seat vis-a-vis prioritising the strategic outlook in Pakistan. The three main strategic considerations of the army are internal security apparatus, the situation in Afghanistan, and the Kashmir-centric India policy. The army\u2019s strategic outlook changes according to the domestic, regional and geo-political situation.\nGen Raheel Sharif prioritised the internal security situation in Pakistan over the situation in Afghanistan and Kashmir. He initiated Operation Zarb-e-Azb in North Waziristan in 2014, which is still ongoing, to target the Tehrik-e-Taliban (TTP) operatives; and the Karachi operation against local criminal syndicates, etc. to improve the overall security environment in Pakistan. During his tenure, the India-Pakistan bilateral has witnessed numerous highs and lows, beginning from Sharif\u2019s visit to India and Modi\u2019s visit to Lahore, the Pathankot and Uri attacks, and finally, the surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC).\nThe new COAS will take some time to draw the roadmap for next three years. His strategic priorities are expected to include the clampdown on home-grown groups \u2013 such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), Jamaat-ul-Ahrar \u2013 affiliated to the Islamic State (IS); continuing military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) in the Federally Administered Tribal Agency region; monitoring the separatist activities in Balochistan and Sindh provinces; helping the Sharif government in its efforts to mainstream FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa before the 2018 elections; resumption of peace talks with the Taliban along with countries including China and Russia.\nPresently, India and Pakistan are fighting a limited tactical battle along the LoC and the International Border (IB) with regular incidents of cross-border firing. In such a scenario, Gen Bajwa\u2019s foremost priority would be to either continue the present status quo along the border or consider a possible shift in the Pakistan Army\u2019s Kashmir policy. Having spent a considerable part of his military service in the Rawalpindi-based 10 Corps that is responsible for guarding the LoC, it is expected that Gen Bajwa would try to use his organisational experience to influence the Sharif government\u2019s Kashmir-centric India policy.\nIt is a wait-and-watch situation for India. The future of any dialogue process between India and Pakistan is heavily dependent on the civil-military relations in Pakistan. With the considerably weak Opposition and the change in military leadership, Sharif has a plausible chance to consolidate his influence in the domestic arena. In order to do that, Sharif will direct his ministers and diplomatic advisors to continue to internationalise the Kashmir issue. It is also possible that Pakistan will raise the Kashmir issue at the upcoming HoA conference in India. That will satisfy the domestic audience, whom Sharif is targeting for the 2018 general elections, and will also send across a strong message to the new military leadership in a bid to bolster civil-military relations.\nAlso, it is important to understand that the Pakistani military\u2019s institutional thinking is unlikely to change in the near future. Gen Bajwa might consider targeting terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), or the Haqqani Network under international pressure. But Pakistan is likely to continue its current orientation of supporting certain non-state actors and concurrently, playing the nuclear card as a deterrence policy against India.\n* Sarral Sharma\nResearcher, IReS, IPCS\nE-mail: [email protected]\n}}

{{Posted Wednesday, July 18, 2018 10:10 pm\nThe Salvation Army of Wilson isn\u2019t going anywhere, but changes are on the horizon to get the nonprofit operating in the black \u2014 and community support is an integral part of the plan.\n\u201cWith the community\u2019s help, I think we can get our feet planted correctly in the ground and move forward,\u201d said board member Gary Proffitt, reading an overview of the plan from the Salvation Army\u2019s Divisional Headquarters. \u201c\u2018The goal of all this is for the Salvation Army in Wilson to successfully execute a balanced operational plan and for an active officer to be appointed next year. The appointment can only happen if the command operates within budget.\u2019\u201d\nMembers representing advisory bodies for the Salvation Army church, store and Boys and Girls Club were tasked earlier this year with developing a short-term and a long-term plan. The plans\u2019 goal was to shore up the operations as well as tackle the organization\u2019s $300,000 in debt to headquarters, two-thirds of which originated a decade ago.\n\u201cThe bottom line is we need to have the mentality that when the money comes in, it has to go to the bills first. We don\u2019t spend the money, we pay the bills first just like being at home,\u201d said Becky Calhoun, the organization\u2019s bookkeeper. \u201cIf we had stayed with that format, things would be a lot different now.\u201d\nTo address the debt, the boards prepared a plan that included selling a four-bedroom house on Brentwood Drive used to house the organization\u2019s officers as well as property on Jackson Street along with several vehicles. The plan from headquarters strayed away from selling the home and noted only top dollar would be accepted for the Jackson Street property, but Maj. Bobby Lancaster has been tasked with determining which vehicles should be sold. The boards had hoped revenue from the sales would satisfy the bulk of the debt with the rest forgiven.\n\u201cThe debt is just an albatross on our back holding us down when we\u2019re trying to stand up,\u201d board member Bruce Jackson said during the plan presentation Wednesday. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re not the ones that really caused all that debt, then maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for paying it.\u201d\nProffitt said headquarters is giving the organization a 12-month pass on debt payments with Lancaster noting there is a possibility for some of it to be forgiven in the future. Advisory board member Will Farris urged the administration to make payments toward the debt as soon as possible.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think we\u2019re somewhat kicking the can down the road,\u201d said board member Connor Bedgood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the situation we were in last February, and I can\u2019t help but think that debt is still looming with no long-term plan to address it.\u201d\nLancaster said he is finalizing the budget for fiscal year 2018-19 and advisory board chairman David Clark said efforts will be made to service the debt when possible.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t walk into this debt yesterday and we\u2019re not going to get out of it tomorrow,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cIt is not going to happen that fast, but I can assure you that we\u2019ll pay the debt as we can pay it.\u201d\nHeadquarters also recommended Lancaster take a comprehensive look at staffing, services and resources to find budget cuts and program improvements. Proffitt said financial contributions and donations of goods to be resold in the store will be critical in the coming months as well as support for the kettle campaign\u2019s goal of $125,000.\n\u201cFor us to do this, we all have to get on board,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cWe all have to buy into it and if we work the plan, the man up above will bless us.\u201d\nProffitt said anyone with questions about the plan can call him at 252-291-4479. To volunteer for the Salvation Army or make a donation, call 252-243-2696.\n}}

{{KABUL: France's Defence Minister was due to travel to Afghanistan yesterday, hours after an attack that killed four French soldiers and an announcement that the country would begin withdrawing its troops next month.\nThe attack by a burqa-clad Taliban suicide bomber was the first fatal incident for French troops since the new President, Francois Hollande, took office last month.\nSpeaking after the attack in eastern Afghanistan, Mr Hollande, who has promised to bring France's combat troops home by the end of the year, announced that the withdrawal would begin next month. He also asked the Defence Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, to go to Afghanistan immediately.\nFive more soldiers were wounded, three critically, in Saturday's attack in the Nijrab district of Kapisa province, where most of France's 3500 soldiers are stationed, officials said. Support for the Afghan war plummeted when four soldiers were killed in January by an Afghan soldier.\nLoading\nMr Hollande reiterated his promise to withdraw all combat troops by the end of 2012, a year earlier than initially planned, saying the latest attack had not changed his plans. ''What happened does not change anything. It neither accelerates nor delays'' withdrawal plans, he said. While some have called for the withdrawal to be speeded up, ''it is not possible to go faster'', he said.\nAgence France-Presse, Los Angeles Times\n}}

{{The US agenda of proxy wars and fake revolutions in Syria are pointed to one end: to eliminate oppositional forces who have any potential of disrupting the global takeover of the Elite.\nAl-Qaeda, the CIA funded Boogeyman, has been aiding and encouraging the Free Syrian Army (FSA); even in so far as recruiting more members to fuel the \u201cpolitical transition\u201d of Assad out of power in his own country.\nThe FSA are not just tied to al-Qaeda, the fake Islamic terrorist group, they ARE al-Qaeda. In a video of members of the FSA, these men are brandishing AK-47s provided to them by the CIA and have al-Qaeda flags flying in the background.\nMembers of FSA openly admit they are fighting for al-Qaeda. Abu Khuder, militant in the FSA explains : \u201cWe have clear instructions from our [al-Qaeda] leadership that if the FSA need our help we should give it. We help them with IEDs and car bombs. Our main talent is in the bombing operations.\u201d\nAbu Thuha (a pseudonym) is an al-Qaeda operative who claims that \u201cwe have experience now fighting the Americans, and more experience now with the Syrian revolution. Our big hope is to form a Syrian-Iraqi Islamic state for all Muslims, and then announce our war against Iran and Israel, and free Palestine.\u201d\nAs the fighting forces of the FSA are \u201cnew\u201d to this proxy \u201crevolutionary\u201d war, they lean on al-Qaeda \u201cexperience in these military activities and it knows how to deal with it.\u201d\nAl-Qaeda\u2019s role in FSA is to provide more than leadership, but become psychologically entangled in these young minds so that their mission is not deterred at any cost. The use of religion and discipline are tactics that keep the men in line and ready to kill or be killed for the cause of the US government.\nKhuder says: \u201cal-Qaeda goal is establishing an Islamic state and not a Syrian state. Those who fear the organization fear the implementation of Allah\u2019s jurisdiction. If you don\u2019t commit sins there is nothing to fear.\u201d\nWhile the ground troops are being coerced by al-Qaeda, NATO is becoming a more active presence in the convoluted mess of \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d that seem to only have global Elite schemes in mind.\nThe Obama administration is focusing on increasing aid to the Free Syrian Army and other oppositional factions to facilitate a forced regime change in Syria.\nAndrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, admits that the US government \u201c[is] looking at the controlled demolition [of the Syrian government]. But like any controlled demolition, anything can go wrong.\u201d\nThe Pentagon have been plotting and overseeing terrorist activities in Syria as the campaign for regime change marches on. Along with NATO and French Special Forces, the US government has been placing strategic measures to make sure terrorism is carried out in Syria.\nThe globalists at the RAND Corporation admit that \u201cal-Qaeda has conducted roughly two dozen attacks, primarily against Syrian security service targets. Virtually all have been suicide attacks and car bombings, and they have resulted in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 injuries.\u201d\nJames Quinlivan, senior operations research analyst at the RAND Corporation, a globalist front for Elite agendas, regarding Syrian chemical weapons, claims that \u201ccalibration is a big deal for these things. While mustard [gas] lasts amazingly well, nerve agents do not. For nerve gases, particularly sarin, retention relies on purity, and this must be tested.\u201d\nMore propaganda surrounding the framing of Syria surfaced in Austria\u2019s Kronen Zeitung wherein a Photoshopped picture of a supposed war torn Aleppo masked a man walking with his child in his arms.\nThe picture was enhanced because the Syrian family in the photo \u201cmerely fleeing a city ravaged by guns and mortars apparently isn\u2019t quite dramatic enough on its own.\u201d\nMeanwhile the Turkish army is conducting \u201cstaged tank exercises\u201d at the Syrian border where military is deployed. While the mainstream media claim that none of the Turkish military forces will be added to the FSA and oppositional terrorists in Syria, more than 25 tanks were involved in practicing for war.\nTurkey, who is a NATO member, has been setting up areas for training camps for the CIA to create more members of FSA, provide intelligence and military weaponry before sending them over the border to assist in the regime change.\nTayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, has been working with the US government in attempting to \u201chand over Assad\u201d.\nThe global Elite have decided that the US State Department and the Syrian National Council will control Syria . As of now, they are involved in a strategic divide and conquer mission. In the future, as Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, has stated , the geopolitical objective is to turn fake humanitarian efforts by the UN\u2019s Kofi Annan while establishing international mandate that will end in the globalist control over this region.\nThe false flag assertion of Syrian chemical weapons is giving the general public the necessary fuel to support the US\/Israeli military attack of Syria.\nIt is being kept secret from the general public with the assistance of the MSM that the murder of Syrian civilians is being committed by the FSA under the direction of the CIA, the script being played out to keep Assad\u2019s armies under foot with \u201clittle chance of turning defeat into victory.\u201d\n}}

{{FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo. \u2014 The U.S. Army is training troops to use 3-D printers to build concrete barracks, or to use drones to gather intelligence in contaminated spots that might be dangerous for soldiers.\nScanner technology currently used by the law enforcement agencies to document crime scenes in 3-D could someday be used on the battlefield to make maps with previously unthinkable levels of detail.\nSome of that technology is being tested at Fort Leonard Wood, which showed off the machines to journalists this week. It\u2019s part of a program the Army calls the Maneuver Support, Sustainment, Protection, Integration Experiment. The goal is to allow service members who might use the devices during deployments to test them and have input before the technology is declared field-ready, The Springfield News-Leader reported.\nThe strategy makes the military more efficient and saves money, said Mike McCarthy, deputy to the commanding general for the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence at Fort Leonard Wood.\n\u201cUsing this process takes 40 percent less time from concept to fielding new technology than traditional methods,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt also has a significant cost savings. You don\u2019t have to go back and fix it after fielding.\u201d\nAnd soldiers, who often have to adapt to survive in the field, can offer ideas for technology that might never occur to engineers in a design-lab setting, he said.\nMegan Kreiger, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official based in Champaign, Illinois, demonstrated a 3-D printing technology called ACES: Automated Construction of Expeditionary Structures. It is the size of a large garden shed and can use concrete to build a barracks hut to house 20 soldiers in about 21.5 hours, she said.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer.

The Army and the Corps also want to develop ACES technology that would allow soldiers to print out structures using dirt found on-site to form bricks rather than importing sacks of cement powder into a deployment area.\nAnother technology at the demonstration was two types of drones outfitted with technology the Army calls \u201cC-SIRP.\u201d They contain miniaturized sensors mounted on the underside of quadcopter drones, which could be deployed ahead of soldiers. One was called Deep Purple, designed and made by the government, and InstantEye, manufactured by Physical Sciences Inc.\nThe sensors can detect chemical contamination and other conditions in zones. Fiona Narayanan, who has worked on Deep Purple, said the goal was to use existing technologies to help commanders make better decisions more quickly, reducing the risk to human life.\n\u201cThis negates us going to any given bad place,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Nathaniel Boe, one of the service members testing C-SIRP. \u201cIt keeps us out of danger.\u201d\nAnother technology was a laser scanner, called FARO Focus, which is currently used by law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and New York City police department, said special agent Edward Wheeler. They can make 800,000 measurements in 3-D per second. That allows law enforcement officers to record data at a crime scene in about 40 minutes rather than taking two or three hours to measure everything by hand.\n}}

{{The military post, Fort Hood in Killeen is the U.S. Army post with the most sexual assault reports and the second most of any military installation around the world according to a report released by the Department of Defense.\nThe reports show the numbers of sexual assaults reports made to the Sexual Assault ResponseCoordinators (SARCs) between 2013 to 2016.\nThe Department of Defense uses the term \u201csexual assault\u201d to refer to adult sex crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, aggravated and abusive sexual contact and attempts to commit those offenses.\nThe Pentagon classifies reports of sexual assault as either unrestricted or restricted.\nAn unrestricted report is referred for investigation and the commanders of the service member who made it are notified as well as the alleged suspect or suspects.\nA restricted report is not referred for criminal investigation or to commanders and allows the service member who made it to seek confidential support, medical care and counseling.\nFort Hood had a total of 863 reports made between 2013 to 2016.\nIn 2013 there were 165 unrestricted reports and 42 restricted. In 2014, there were 212 unrestricted reports and 50 restricted. In 2015 there were 164 unrestricted reports and 31 restricted. In 2016, there were 155 unrestricted reports and 44 restricted.\nThe Naval Station in Norfolk, VA had a total of 1,055 sexual assaults reported between the same years.\nThe report said the location of where a report was made does not necessarily mean the incident occurred at that location.The reason is that victims may report a sexual assault at a time and place of their choosing. The sexual assault may also have occurred elsewhere, including the civilian sector and\/or prior to entering military service.\n\"One of the features of the department's reporting program is that service members can report allegations of sexual assault at any time and at any place,\" said Dr. Nate Galbreath, deputy director DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.\n\"As a result, the number of reports listed for an installation doesn't necessarily mean that the alleged incident occurred there. A report could involve allegations for an incident that occurred while on deployment, while away on leave, or even prior to entering the military.

{{This week, U.S. Army leaders revealed a much clearer picture of the service's plan to replace its M249 squad automatic weapon and M4A1 carbine with weapons that share an advanced 6.8mm round.\nFor more than a year, modernization officials have offered few details about the Next Generation Squad Weapon program. But over the past three months, the service has taken tangible steps to advance the effort from concept to prototype.\nThe Army released a vague Oct. 4 draft solicitation describing its plans to award future deals to companies to build prototypes of the Next Generation Squad Weapon-Rifle, or NGSW-R, and the Next Generation Squad Weapon-Automatic Rifle, or NGSW-AR, chambered for a newly designed, \"government-provided\" 6.8mm cartridge.\nThe solicitation followed an announcement in July that the Army had awarded five contracts to gun makers to develop prototypes of only the auto rifle.\nBrig. Gen. Anthony Potts, commander of Program Executive Office Soldier, explained how the solicitations work together at the 2018 Association of the United States Army's Annual Meeting and Exhibition.\nThe prototypes from the contracts awarded in July are scheduled to be delivered to the Army next June for evaluation, he said.\nAdded lethality\nThe release of the Oct. 4 solicitation is designed to get feedback from the defense industry about making adjustments to the Army-developed 6.8mm round so it works efficiently in both the rifle and auto rifle versions of the NGSW, Potts explained.\n\"The rationale for doing that is we truly want to get to a common cartridge,\" he said. \"You want the engineers that are developing these weapons to be able to optimize both concurrently. If you put the AR out first, then they are going to optimize that round for the AR; [if] you put out the rifle first, then they are going to optimize it for the rifle. The round might be too heavy and too big for the rifle, and one might get you a round that's not quite enough for an automatic rifle.\"\nThe Army's interest in developing an advanced 6.8mm round to make the squad more lethal emerged out of a 2017 Small Arms Ammunition Configuration Study, said Brig. Gen. David Hodne, director of the Soldier Lethality Cross-Functional Team.\n\"One of the foundations of that was probability of incapacitation,\" he said. \"Previously, it was good enough to hit something; probability of hit drove a lot of our requirements. We are now looking at energy and range ... critical factors that drive the direction of the Next Generation Squad Weapon in both the automatic rifle and the rifle.\"\nSetting ambitious goals for creating a \"leap-ahead\" weapon system that features an integrated fire-control system and specialized ammunition is nothing new for the Army.\nThe Punisher and other attempts\nArmy engineers worked with industry in the mid-1990s to develop the Objective Individual Combat Weapon, or OICW, a dual weapon system that feature a 20mm airburst weapon mounted overtop a 5.56mm carbine. A high-tech fire-control system allowed soldiers to program 20mm rounds to explode over top of enemy behind cover.\nThe OICW, weighing 18 pounds, proved too heavy and bulky for the battlefield, so the Army attempted to develop the airburst weapon separately. The XM25 featured a 25mm round for increased lethality.\nThe weapon was sent to Afghanistan for operational testing, and combat troops nicknamed it the Punisher, Army officials said.\nProblems with the program started in February 2013 when the XM25 malfunctioned during its second round of operational testing in Afghanistan, inflicting minor injuries on a soldier.\nA month later, elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment refused to take the XM25 with them for a raid on a fortified enemy compound in Afghanistan because they were concerned its limited basic load of 25mm rounds was not enough to justify taking an M4A1 carbine out of the mission, sources familiar with the incident said.\nLast year, the Army canceled its agreement with Orbital ATK Inc., which led to the end of the XM25 program.\nThere have been other slow-burn efforts, such as the Lightweight Small Arms Technology, a program the Army has invested in during the past decade to develop weapons that fire special case-telescoped ammunition.\nLast year, Textron Systems officials showed off their latest offshoot of the LSAT, the Intermediate Case-Telescoped Carbine, chambered for 6.5mm on the AUSA exhibition floor.\nThe 6.5mm case-telescoped ammunition weighs 35 percent less and offers 30 percent more lethality than 7.62mm x 51mm brass ammunition, Textron officials said.\nThe company chose to use the 6.5mm CT round while the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, or ARDEC, was developing the actual projectile, Textron officials said.\nA new, long-range caliber\nNow the Army is touting a new 6.8mm round that has an \"accurate range far in excess of any existing, known military rifle today,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at AUSA on Monday.\nMilitary.com asked the Army to clarify information on the extended range of the new 6.8mm, but Hodne would say only that it \"will go beyond 300\" meters, the maximum range for M4\/M4A1 qualification.\nOne aspect of the new NGSW program is different from past programs such as the OICW or the XM25. It's the first time Milley, who was sitting beside Army Secretary Mark Esper, said that the service is \"committed to a new rifle and a new squad automatic weapon.\"\nAnother difference: Army officials plan to issue these new weapons only to soldiers in infantry and other close-combat units, instead of trying to convince Congress to buy enough to equip more than one million active-duty, National Guard and Reserve soldiers.\nDespite the energy behind the effort, the future of the NGSW is still uncertain. Congress did not grant approval for the Army to start the program in fiscal 2019, Potts said.\n\"We did not get approval to ... start a combat rifle program, next gen squad automatic rifle program in 2019,\" he said, adding that the Army hopes to officially start the program in 2020.\n\"Perhaps Congress reconsiders allowing us to start this year. If not, we start next year and that will drive the timelines,\" Potts said.\n-- Matthew Cox can be reached at matthew.cox@military.com.\n}}

Are they also disqualified now?\u201d\n\u201cIt would virtually eliminate the Chaplain Corps,\u201d he added.\nBerry said he hasn\u2019t represented any military religious leaders of other faiths in a situation like this one, but reiterated that the Army has thought of the possibility and established training guidance for when it inevitably occurs.\n\u201cIn this instance, Squires did exactly what Army regulations tell him to do, which is to reschedule the event,\u201d Berry said. \u201cIn fact, the event was rescheduled at the detriment of other couples who could not attend the new event.\u201d\n}}

{{'Biggest hero of the Vietnam War' denied burial at U.S. army cemetery\nHe led one of America's most secret battles and was once known as \u2018the biggest hero of the Vietnam War\u2019.\nBut Major General Vang Pao, the Laos ethnic minority leader who died last month, cannot be buried at an American military cemetery, the U.S. Army has said.\nGeneral Pao's family had asked the Army if he could be buried with full military honours at Arlington National Cemetery. But this request was rejected.\nMuch-loved: Major General Vang Pao led thousands of Hmong soldiers as they fought alongside the U.S. but he will not be buried at Arlington National Cemetery\nSecret war: This photo from 2003 showed how the Hmong people still lived in fear of Laotian communist and Vietnamese troops, long after the war had ended\nHe led a 15-year CIA-sponsored secret war in Southeast Asia and fought alongside U.S. troops in Vietnam, but died last month.\nLaos was entangled in the Vietnam War more than 40 years ago, when a remote corner of the country covered an area of North Vietnamese supply vital to the war effort in the south.\nPoll Should General Pao get a burial slot at Arlington? No Yes Should General Pao get a burial slot at Arlington? No 150 votes\nYes 478 votes Now share your opinion\nThe Americans, who were desperate to stop arms getting to the Communists, launched a secret war against a large part of eastern Laos.\nIt was the war that America could not reveal and the decision to reject the family's request will anger those who believe the U.S. has used and abused its Vietnam allies.\nCongressman Jim Costa asked on behalf of General Pao\u2019s family for the Army to grant an exception to Arlington\u2019s rules, which state that he must have served in the U.S. armed forces to be buried there.\nCongressman Costa asked that he is buried alongside U.S. soldiers in Arlington and said the decision was \u2018very disappointing\u2019 for everyone honouring General Pao.\n\u2018He is not just a hero to the Hmong people,\u2019 he added. \u2018He is a hero to those American men and women who served with him in Vietnam.\u2019\nThe Army\u2019s decision comes as mourners attend a six-day funeral in California.\nWar legend: Former CIA chief William Colby, pictured here in 1975, once described General Pao as 'the biggest hero of the Vietnam War'\nA Pentagon spokesman said it had thoroughly reviewed the request but a unanimous decision was reached that he did not fulfil the criteria for burial at Arlington.\nIt is not clear where General Pao will now be buried, but the family plan to appeal and can still ask Defence Secretary Robert Gates and U.S. President Barack Obama to make an exception.\nThere are 62 foreign nationals buried at Arlington, according to the cemetery's website, including ten from South Vietnam - although the identity of nine of them is unknown.\nCharlie Waters, a military veteran and friend of General Pao, said he received \u2018a lame excuse that it would take the place away from an American serviceman\u2019 and even offered to give up his own plot.\nGeneral Pao died in Fresno, California, which has a large Hmong community, and tens of thousands of military and Hmong mourners gathered there for a traditional funeral.\nFormer CIA chief William Colby once described him as \u2018the biggest hero of the Vietnam War\u2019.\nHe fought against the Japanese in World War Two, with the French against the North Vietnamese in the 1950s and led thousands of guerrilla troops in an American-backed force in the 60s and 70s.\nBut General Pao was a controversial figure for his insistence on freedom from foreign domination, and critics say his allegiance with the U.S. caused suffering for his people.\nFamous: Arlington Ceremony is an important site in American history and there are 62 foreign nationals buried there, including ten from South Vietnam\nHe died aged 81 after complications from pneumonia.\nHmong is an ethnic group that backed America in the 1960s when conflict spread from Vietnam into Laos and Cambodia, but it now suffers marginalisation and persecution in Lao society.\nMany members of the Hmong group fled in 1975 when Laos came under communist rule, and they now have large communities in California, Minnesota, Thailand and Australia.\nThe 'secret war' that made General Pao famous has been kept secret by the U.S. for some time, but the lid is starting to be lifted on it.\nAir Force Chief Master Sergeant Richard L. Etchberger, who died in Laos in 1968, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honour by U.S. President Barack Obama last September.\nMr Obama said at the time that it was 'never too late to do the right thing' and 'pay tribute to our Vietnam veterans and their families'.\n}}

{{SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Growing up in eastern China, Panshu Zhao fell in love with America. He read the Bible his parents gave him, watched Hollywood movies and studied the ideals of democracy. He jumped at the chance to attend graduate school at Texas A&M University.\nIn 2016, Zhao enlisted in the U.S. Army as part of a special recruitment program offering immigrants in the country legally a path to citizenship.\nThe future, he said, was bright.\nNow, he is one of the dozens of immigrant recruits and reservists struggling with abrupt, often unexplained military discharges and canceled contracts. They traded being willing to risk their lives for the prospect of U.S. citizenship, a timeworn exchange that\u2019s drawn linguists, medical specialists and thousands of other immigrants to the military since the Revolutionary War.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like you\u2019re dropped from heaven to hell,\u201d Zhao told The Associated Press on Friday.\nIt is unclear how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been ousted from the Army, but immigration attorneys told the AP that they know of more than 40 recruits who recently have been discharged or whose status has become questionable.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Others said the Army informed them they\u2019d been labeled as security risks because they have relatives abroad or because the Defense Department had not completed background checks on them.\nThe Pentagon said Friday that there has been no policy change since last year, when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no one could enter basic training without completion of a background investigation.\nPentagon tightens rules for immigrant recruits Foreign-born military recruits will face more screening requirements and will have to wait longer to get expedited citizenship.\nAnd Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said that any enlistee entering the military undergoes security screenings.\n\u201cEach recruit undergoes an individualized suitability review and the length of time for the review is dependent upon each individual\u2019s unique background,\u201d Smith said.\nZhao, 31, said his \u201cship out\u201d date to basic training was delayed for two years as he underwent background checks, counterintelligence interviews and rigorous reviews added as requirements for immigrant enlistees.\nThis photo provided by Panshu Zhao shows Zhao at the White House on April 21, 2018. (Panshu Zhao via AP)\nHe continued to pursue his PhD in geography at Texas A&M but also hit the gym, prepping for boot camp. And he trained \u2014 in uniform \u2014 with his unit. He had military identification and health care, he said.\nIn April, Zhao visited Washington for the first time, touring the White House and visiting the Republican National Committee.\nThat same month, he got word from his unit commander: He was being discharged. He was told simply that his discharge was \u201cuncharacterized,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a national threat,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cOn the contrast, I\u2019m a national merit because people like me with higher education and critical skills, we want to serve this great U.S. Army. I\u2019m a good scientist no matter what.\u201d\nThe Pentagon announced last October that in order to apply for citizenship, immigrant recruits were required to have gone through basic training and served honorably for either 180 days or a year, depending on their Army classification. But that requirement has been challenged in court.\nSome discharged service members whose basic training was delayed cannot start the naturalization process. Others who started the process have had their applications put on hold.\nNaturalizations drop 65 percent for service members seeking citizenship after Mattis memo The number of service members applying for and earning U.S. citizenship through military service has dropped 65 percent since Defense Secretary Jim Mattis directed additional background checks for non-citizen troops.\nImmigration attorneys told the AP that many immigrants let go in recent weeks received an \u201cuncharacterized discharge,\u201d which is neither dishonorable nor honorable.\nA Brazilian reservist, Lucas Calixto, filed a lawsuit in Washington last week contending that he was booted without the Defense Department giving him a chance to defend himself or appeal.\nPresident George W. Bush ordered \u201cexpedited naturalization\u201d for immigrant soldiers in 2002 in an effort to swell military ranks. Seven years later, the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, known as MAVNI, became an official recruiting program.\nThe program came under fire from conservatives when President Barack Obama added DACA recipients \u2014 young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally \u2014 to the list of eligible enlistees. In response, the military layered on additional security clearances for recruits to pass before heading to boot camp.\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration added even more hurdles, creating a backlog within the Defense Department. Last fall, hundreds of recruits still in the enlistment process had their contracts canceled. A few months later, the military suspended MAVNI.\nUS closes naturalization offices at military basic training sites The number of foreign-born service members becoming U.S. citizens dropped 16 percent last year.\nRepublican Congressman Andy Harris of Maryland, who has supported legislation to limit the program, told the AP that MAVNI was established by executive order.\n\u201cOur military must prioritize enlisting American citizens, and restore the MAVNI program to its specialized, limited scope,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Air Force Maj. Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman, the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of MAVNI candidates are from Asia and Africa because those are the critical language skills needed in the military.\nAs of April, 1,100 immigrant recruits were awaiting basic training while undergoing security reviews, the Pentagon said.\nEligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Most go the Army, but some also go to the other military branches.\nZhao is now rethinking his future, but said he wishes he had a chance to appeal.\n\u201cI need justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is America. This is not China. This is not the Middle East. This is not a dictatorship. And that\u2019s why I love America.\u201d\n}}

{{The man nominated to be the next Army secretary faced questions on a range of topics during his Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing Thursday, but perhaps most importantly, he heard a clear warning: Don\u2019t waste billions on major projects that go nowhere.\nMark Esper is a retired Army lieutenant colonel, West Point graduate and Gulf War veteran who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense under former President George W. Bush.\nEsper most recently spent the past seven years working for defense contractor Raytheon, overseeing its lobbying in Washington, D.C.\nIn his opening questions, SASC Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the committee was frustrated with failed major weapons systems that cost taxpayers billions.\n\u201cFor example, over the last 10 years or so we have wasted about $40 billion on programs like the Future Combat Systems, the Comanche Attack Helicopter, the Crusader Howitzer, the Joint Tactical Radio System and the Distributed Common Ground System Army,\u201d the senator said.\nMcCain also brought up the $6 billion failure of the Warfighter Information Network Tactical, known as WIN-T.\n\u201cLet me just tell you now, that is not acceptable to the taxpayers of America,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe do not want any more of these failures. You lose credibility with the American people when a program has to be cancelled that cost the taxpayers over $6 billion. We just can\u2019t keep wasting billions of dollars like this. We just can\u2019t.\u201d\nEsper agreed, telling committee members that minor fixes are insufficient, and that the requirements and acquisitions process needs a total overhaul to avoid those types of mistakes.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\n\u201cYou need to take a holistic approach that looks at processes, programs and people and policies,\u201d Esper said.\nHe also pushed for more to be done on defining Army requirements at the beginning of the process and holding people and organizations accountable throughout the development and acquisition.\nMcCain then went on to ask Esper if the Army was ready to fight combined arms maneuver warfare against a near-peer competitor.\n\u201cI think with only one third of the brigade combat teams and 25 percent of the combat aviation brigades ready, engaging in such a conflict would be a significant risk,\u201d Esper said.\nHe went on to say that he wanted to push more quickly toward a sustained readiness goal of having 66 percent of the force in a combat-ready status. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley previously estimated it would take the Army until 2023 to reach that goal.\nIn addition to major acquisition programs, Esper\u2019s confirmation hearing also drilled down on smaller programs such as replacing the M16\/M4 service rifle.\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, asked Esper if he would encourage competition and look at commercial sources for the rifle replacement.\nEsper said he saw competition and commercial options as crucial to finding the best weapon available. He added that he would do the same with as many programs as he could.\nThe nominee\u2019s recent work in the defense industry did not go unnoticed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who asked that Esper commit to the White House policy of recusing himself from dealings relate to his previous employer for two years, rather than the previously stated one-year pledge.\nEsper agreed to do that.\nWarren then queried him on what recent programs he\u2019d been involved with lobbying the government on behalf of Raytheon.\nEsper said that as vice president of government relations, he managed all Raytheon lobbying efforts but was personally involved with the Patriot Radar System, the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile System Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, and the Distributed Army Common Ground System.\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, asked what Esper would do to capitalize on private sector innovation, especially with autonomy and robotics.\nEsper said work with robotics, drones and other automated technologies would be looked at across the board.\nA former infantry officer, Esper said he envisioned ground convoys at some point being conducted autonomously to avoid risks to soldiers such as the Army saw in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nEsper, who was nominated in July, is the third nominee for Army secretary. President Trump\u2019s first pick, West Point grad Vincent Viola, withdrew his name in February, citing the strict Defense Department rules concerning his family businesses.\nIn May, Tennessee State Sen. Mark Green withdrew his name from consideration after what he called \u201cfalse and misleading attacks\u201d concerning his past comments on gay rights and evolution.\n}}

{{In this era of high-decibel television reality shows where contestants are lured by a bagful of money and 15 seconds of fame, \u2018Mission Army\u2019 on National Geographic Channel attempts to do something different \u2013 give an insider\u2019s view of the rigours and regimen of one of the most revered institutions of the country, the Indian Army.\n\u2018Definitely this is to promote the Indian Army. This is a show that helps people understand the life of the army in an easier way. The language is easier. It gives a clear picture of what it takes to be an army officer. That\u2019s the beauty of this show,\u2019 National Geographic Channel\u2019s vice president (content) Ramon Chibb told IANS on phone from Delhi.\nPreviously, the channel did similar shows based on the navy and the air force, but getting permission from the army was tougher, says Chibb.\n\u2018In 2003, when we went for localisation and thought that our channel needs to be watched, we came up with the documentary \u2018Mission Everest\u2019. We had that access. Not many channels had that time. Then we did \u2018Mission Air Force\u2019 in 2005 and in 2007 we did it with the Indian Navy.\n\u2018This time it was a bit rigorous because it was the Indian Army\u2026.the army is a bit more secretive organisation, you know. They don\u2019t open up that easily. Seeing our reach and heritage, they allowed us to show the lives of army personnel,\u2019 he said.\nThe channel received over 35,000 applications for the show, of which five were selected.\n\u2018There were around 35,000 applicants. We first did a grand selection in three cities Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. There we went to a selection process, which was very akin to the army selection board\u2026with physical and psychological tests and personal interview.\n\u2018Finally, 15 went for proper medical test in Delhi Army Medical and from there, 10 were declared medically fit. Rajputana Rifles put these 10 people through another set of tests and from there we got the final five,\u2019 explains Chibb.\nOver the next 10 episodes, these five youngsters will handle combat guns, manoeuvre battle tanks and undergo rigorous training at key army establishments like Commando School in Belgaum, High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg, the Armoured Corps Centre at Ahmednagar and the Artillery Centre in Deolali.\n\u2018We have gone through all aspects of the army, right from the time of selection stage to medical to the training in an academy in branches like infantry, artillery, aviation and ordnance.\n\u2018At every juncture, we had to go through the physical tasks. So we got to know how tough training they have to go through to be an army officer,\u2019 said Chibb.\nThe winner would get first-hand experience of an international mission of the Indian Army.\n\u2018It\u2019s not like other reality shows. It\u2019s putting real people into real situations. In the past mission we have given two fighter pilots to the nation,\u2019 he added.\nOne of the five finalists, 23-year-old IBM executive Ela Vohra said: \u2018I came to know about \u2018Mission Army\u2019 online.

{{\"Freedom's biggest army\": Scenes from the NRA convention 2013 Fear, paranoia and loathing at the \"most spectacular display of firearms in the world\"\nHOUSTON -- To swing the door on a National Rifle Association annual meeting is to enter a world where Freedom comes from a gun. The gun's purpose is not important. It doesn't have to be American made. It can be any number of shapes, so long as it has a grip, a trigger, and a barrel. But only from a gun barrel can Freedom flow. In the words of multiple NRA members who confronted protestors this past weekend, \"The Second Amendment is the one thing protecting the First.\"\nLast May in St. Louis, NRA leaders pounded away at this idea in a torrent of Apocalyptic warnings about the consequences of failure in the November elections. A year later, gathering two weeks after helping defeat the biggest effort to strengthen gun laws in a generation, the same men delivered the NRA's Second Amendment gospel with a newfound swagger. Unchanged was the primacy of guns and gun rights in the NRA's understanding of the world and everything in it. In his opening speech, Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre described the gun enthusiasts before him as \"Freedom's biggest army, greatest hope, and brightest future.\" The group's chief lobbyist-strategist, the boyish Tennessean Chris Cox, celebrated the convention as \"the biggest celebration ever of American values,\" whose 86,000-plus attendees embodied \"the essence of participation in American democracy.\"\nAdvertisement:\nNRA summits involve leadership votes and platform debates, but NRA-style democracy isn't about those things alone. It's also about the guns that make it possible. Which is why NRA conventions feature an exhibition hall packed with hundreds of booths displaying Freedom's latest fashions -- what the group calls \"the most spectacular displays of firearms, shooting and hunting accessories in the world.\"\nThe big story on the floor this year was the post-election sales bounce following Sandy Hook and a revitalized gun violence debate. Companies that had reduced production to normal post-election levels in November were blindsided by second buying frenzy and have yet to recover their balance. Among the biggest beneficiaries is the assault rifle industry the NRA did much to nurture in the 1980s. \"Sales are through the roof,\" said a rep from Stag Arms. \"We have an eight to 12-month wait.\" A manager from Core Rifle Systems described the recent frenzy as \"almost a little ridiculous. But it's good for business. We have a two-year back order producing 3,500 rifles a month.\" DSA Inc., which makes a range of ARs and grenade launchers, says it's getting 2,000 emails a day. \"Business is good, it's real, real good for all of us,\" said a rep from the online assault weapon retailer CheaperThanDirt.com. Behind him hung an oversized check for $500,000 made out to the NRA.\nVeteran guns and ammo dealers see the current frenzy as resulting from several developments that together have created a perfect storm of paranoia among the gun community. Obama's reelection, legislative movement on Capitol Hill, the UN Arms Trade Treaty, reports of large purchases of ammunition by federal agencies -- all have been hyped in the gun press and in rightwing media as heralding everything from ammo droughts to full-on police state tyranny.\n\"Together with all the gun stuff in the news, you still have the bad economy, which means survival purchases of the three B's -- beans, bullets, and booze,\" said Jeff Mullins, a bullet designer and owner of Allegiance Ammunition. \"Then people see these reports about the government buying high volume [ammo]. That makes people think, 'Well, they're buying it to keep it from us.' I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but...\"\nWhen Mullins trailed off, an attendee listening nearby finished the thought. \"Everybody is thinking that way,\" he said. \"Nobody trusts the government.\"\nThis distrust is spreading to their fellow citizens. NRA members have been as jolted by public mass shootings as anyone else. Some of them just come to different conclusions about solutions. Among the workshops offered in Houston were several related to defensive handgun skills, i.e., how to be a good guy with a gun who stops bad guys with guns. The defensive shooting expert Rob Pincus introduced a full auditorium to the methods outlined in his book, Counter Ambush. In his talk, Pincus avoided phrases like \"mass shootings\" and \"rampages,\" instead referring to emergencies in \"the public environment situation.\"\nAdvertisement:\nGrowing demand for bullets capable of dropping a Jared Loughner with one shot has increased interest in frag rounds like those designed by Jeff Mullins. \"People are coming out of a fantasy world and realizing they have to take responsibility for their safety, even when they're at the mall or wherever,\" he said. \"People now realize that bad people sometimes need to be taken out quick.\"\nTo illustrate why his trademarked bullets are the right tools for stopping an ambush, Mullins reached under the counter and pulled out photos of a dead 485-pound Russian boar. His daughter had recently killed it with a single round of his newest design. \"It fragments so well that it creates instant trauma, shutting down the central nervous system,\" he explained. Like so many of his peers, he couldn't guess when his supply would catch up with demand.\nThe boar photos were the second series of graphic images I'd been shown that day depicting flesh shredded by a bullet. The first time was earlier that afternoon, at the protest across the street from the convention center. I arrived to find a New York activist named Aaron Black exchanging words with an NRA board member named Todd Rathner, the only high-level official to visit the protest and speak to press. Raethner was offering a variation of the guns-don't-kill-people argument when Black pulled out full-color photos of a dead girl on a hospital cot, her neck and head ripped open. \"This is my friend's daughter Bri,\" he said. \"This is what's left of her. She lost her only child, and she wanted universal background checks. So did 90 percent of the American people. And you stonewalled it.\"\nSurrounded by protestors, NRA hecklers, and reporters from Japan, Australia, and USA Today, the two men commenced a brief dramatic performance of American gun politics, in miniature.\nAdvertisement:\n\"You don't know that,\" said Rathner, referring to the 90 percent poll.\n\"People are mad.\"\n\"Call your senator.\"\n\"I have, and I'll continue to do so.\"\n\"Well, it ain't working.\"\n\"Well, I ain't going anywhere.\"\nWhen Black stormed off, I followed him and asked about the girl. Her name was Bri Jeffries. Black told me she was the 16-year old daughter of his friend, and had been caught one afternoon in crossfire from an assault rifle on the streets of Washington D.C. \"He needed to see these pictures -- we all do -- because the media Disnifies and sterilizes this issue so much that nobody knows what it looks like,\" said Black. \"But he doesn't care,\" Black added of Rathner. Did you see his face? He looked like a great white shark. He's not representing gun owners. He's representing gun manufacturers. I'm tired of watching our democracy sold to the highest bidder. Campaign finance is the root of this whole thing. That's why we couldn't get the votes.\"\nAdvertisement:\nTodd Rathner has spent much of his professional life working key votes for the gun lobby. A self-described \"Jewish redneck\" and former NRA lobbyist who now runs his own shop in Arizona as well as an African safari company, Rathner celebrates the defeat of the Manchin-Toomey background check legislation and dismisses polls showing a split between NRA members and leadership on the issue of universal background checks. \"Bloomberg paid Frank Luntz for the 72 percent number, and Luntz knows how to manipulate numbers,\" he said. \"And the 90 percent number -- it's bogus.\"\nTime will tell. Even if the polls turn out to be right, Rathner thinks the NRA can deflate support by educating the public on the real menace of attempts to plug leaks in the current background check regime: the menace of a Trojan horse for the kind of universal gun registry that Manchin-Toomey explicitly rejected.\n\"The defeated legislation wanted to subject every transaction to a background check. How do they enforce it? Some form of universal registration is the only way,\" said Rathner. \"That's what this is about. If you simply explain to the American people that universal background checks require universal registration, support for the idea will plummet.\"\nAdvertisement:\nWill it? The supposition that a deep fear of the government unites Joe Public and NRA conventioneers is a risky basis for strategy. Americans are comfortable registering their cars, pets, votes, and marriages, and most would struggle to comprehend the NRA's insurrectionist-tinted freak-out over gun registration - especially given that the freak-out appears to be based on a fantasy. At least, they would until they put on a pair of NRA Freedom Goggles. Viewed through these, registering a Bushmaster XM-15 looks less like registering a used Mazda, and more like registering your freedom of religion.\n\"Would you tolerate having to register your right to free speech?\" Rathner asked. \"Would you submit to a background check before you can publish on the Internet? The Second Amendment is the same as the First. They are both constitutionally protected.\"\nLurking behind the false notion that we don't regulate aspects of speech and peaceable assembly -- you can't yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater, or hold large public protests without a permit -- is the fear, pervasive among the NRA members that attend conventions, that a federal gun registry will lead to an army of repo men going door to door, one micro zip code at a time, like census workers in riot gear.\n\"If you look at history, registration leads to confiscation,\" said Rathner. \"If they know where the guns are, they can come and take 'em. If there's no registration, we don't have to worry about the government. Why does the government need to know all this stuff? Why should they know what I have in my house?\"\nAdvertisement:\nRathner rested his case by saying the so-called gun show loophole is nothing but a media myth. \"I go to gun shows almost every weekend,\" he said. \"More than 90 percent are subject to rules and regulations. Almost all the guns sold on Internet are subject to them as well. The amount of guns sold without background checks is miniscule.\"\nWhat if these cracks in the current system combine with a cheap gun glut to send stray bullets into people like Bri Jeffries? And what if it happens every single day? Maybe that's just Freedom's price. But it's a price the NRA's rural and suburban membership aren't worried about paying. While waiting for the start of a seminar on the ABC's of \"Freedom Finance,\" I asked a voting NRA member from Fort Lauderdale his thoughts on gun violence in American cities. He looked at me like I was stupid, and lowered his voice. \"You know, almost all of these shooting deaths in the cities are black-on-black,\" he said. \"It's not black-on-white.\"\nOther NRA members are more concerned with urban violence and have even initiated programs to extend the group's agenda to big cities. Walking back from a Ted Nugent signing event, I ran into a Kyle Coplen, a 29-year-old gun activist who was carrying an electric guitar shaped like a machine gun. His bright green t-shirts featured the logo of something called the Armed Citizens Project, a young non-profit Coplen founded that distributes free shotguns to residents of high-crime neighborhoods. \"We're combining Joe Biden's love of shotguns with Obama's love of redistribution,\" he said. \"If we get the poor comfortable with being safe and armed in their own home, maybe later they'll join the NRA, and get themselves a concealed handgun license. We look at the shotgun as a gateway gun to the gun culture.\"\nCoplen says they've raised a good amount of money through coverage on AM talk radio, the Breitbart sites, and Fox News, but the ACP can't yet afford American-made guns. \"Right now we're using a cheap, commie Chi-Com 12-gauge pump [shotgun], which is a good gun, but we want to buy American,\" he said.\nAdvertisement:\nThe Project may not have trouble raising money for long. Coplen told me its founders are in the process of formalizing a relationship with the NRA, which would link them with plenty of potential funders eager to fulfill the group's real agenda of statistically \"measuring the effect that a heavily armed society has on crime rates.\"\n\"Providing policy analysis on guns and cities,\" Coplen surmised, would be useful \"in aiding the efforts of decision makers [to] get rid of bad regulations.\"\nLate on the second day of the conference, Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee dropped by the protest across from the convention center. The NRA was in her home district, and she had requested a meeting with Wayne LaPierre, a request the NRA did not acknowledge. Instead, Lee told a sprinkling of reporters why she supported universal background checks and a national registry. \"People think gun registration is something sinister, but it helps you protect your guns the way car registration does when your car is stolen,\" she said. \"It would make an enormous difference to the children and teenagers who lose their lives to guns every three hours and 15 minutes in this country.\"\nLee's strong defense of new regulations was followed by an anachronistic call for dialogue and compromise with the NRA. \"I hope to work with them when I get back to Washington,\" she said.\nAdvertisement:\nWith all due respect to the Congresswoman, she has a better chance of finding a unicorn grazing on the National Mall. Had Lee turned around and looked at the side of the George Brown Convention Center, she would not have found the slogan, \"NRA: Let's Work Together,\" but rather the Alamo-like battle cry, \"Stand and Fight.\" Earlier that morning, the organization adopted a hardline resolution written by WND.com columnist and NRA Endowment memberJeff Knox, resolving to reject \"any and all\" bills containing new gun regulations. The official gesture may have merely enshrined the obvious, but it spoke to a confidence reflecting not just the recent Senate victory, but also the million new members the NRA claims have joined since the election, each paying dues into a war chest already bursting with industry cash and estate gifts.\n\"If you look at the budget for last year, there's $80 million from endowments alone, and this year is going to be bigger,\" said a member from Ohio. \"My kids aren't going to hate it, but I'm leaving a large gift [to the NRA]. They have great people working on legal support and trust services. This is a money war. If you're not well capitalized, you don't impact Congress. The NRA may be a small group of four or five million, but they've got a hell of a kit. If they come at ya', there gonna take you out.\"\nThe evidence on this point is decidedly mixed, and there are signs voters have already turned against senators who voted against Manchin-Toomey. But there's no denying that the power of all that cash to buy enormous amounts of mischief to thwart the public will. The $500,000 check hanging over the CheaperThanDirt.com booth would be a major get for most self-described \"civil rights organizations.\" At the NRA, it's chump change. In Fairfax, gifts are weighed against the seven-figure checks signed every year by Midway's Larry Potterfield, the ammo and sporting goods mogul whose \"round-up\" campaigns have bolstered NRA-ILA coffers for 20 years. At this year's Leadership Forum on Friday afternoon, Potterfield's public donation was accompanied by the seemingly absurd claim that his company, which sells everything from camping equipment to ATV parts, \"wouldn't be in business if not for the NRA.\"\nIt was another statement that only looks absurd until you don your NRA Freedom Goggles. It then becomes clear what Potterfield meant: Without the NRA, private property and the shooting sports would not survive, because Congress would pass popular gun reform regulations, thus destroying the Second Amendment, which is the foundational Freedom upon which everything else rests, including Larry Potterfield's ability to sell rifle rounds and a wide range of duck hunting boots.\nAdvertisement:\nEach of the speakers following Potterfield reiterated this idea in their own way. Rick Santorum said Europe was \"dying\" because it failed to enshrine rights, including gun rights, as God given. Unmentioned by Santorum was the fact that, for all its secular sins, the \"dying\" countries of the EU continue to extend their life-expectancy advantage over the U.S., a trend that might have something to do with the fact that they don't lose 30,000 young citizens annually to gun violence.\nThe man who followed Santorum symbolized the safety of the status quo in the age of the 60-vote hurdle. Texas senator Ted Cruz drew a standing ovation and sent the \"Don't Tread on Me\" flags waving when he promised to filibuster any gun bill to hit the Senate floor on his watch. John Bolton followed Cruz, urging vigilance in opposing the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which he described as \"the Obama administration's back-up plan for failed domestic policy.\" Radio host Mark Levin, who joined the NRA and bought his first gun only 18 months ago, sent a taped message about the \"ominous forces\" gathering against his new favorite Amendment. Texas governor Rick Perry said something to the effect of loving guns and people with guns, but not liking people who hate guns and people with guns. At the meeting's keynote speech the next night, Glenn Beck unveiled an image of Michael Bloomberg giving a Nazi salute, setting off yet another round of condemnations from national Jewish organizations.\nThese were the voices of the \"culture war\" promised by Chris Cox. None of them hold much promise as recruitment tools for the 30-plus million gun owners who don't belong to the NRA. In contrast to the their friends in the RNC, which finds itself in a similar dilemma, the NRA appears utterly oblivious to its smoky Southern regional odor. Last week Media Matters reported that the new NRA president, an Alabama lawyer named James Porter, refers to the Civil War just like his grand pappy did, as the War of Northern Aggression. Things like this just don't play well outside deep Dixie, though it may endear Porter to the several hundred NRA members who attended last weekend's seminar on \"Civil War Sharpshooters,\" which included the heartwarming true story of the \"black reb\" Holt Collier, a talented sniper who stayed loyal to his owner after Emancipation and fought for the Confederacy.\nI lasted about 20 minutes in the Civil War seminar before slipping out to explore the exhibit hall and talk to more gun dealers. Among the companies still on my list to visit was Sig Saur, whose Jumbotronic display anchored one of the biggest and flashiest sets on the floor of NRA 2013. The company had recently initiated a big marketing push around its new line of MPX submachine guns, and large digital screens looped promotional videos of the sleek black guns unloading 30-round magazines on full-auto mode, with long black suppressors reducing the noise and flash. As configured in the ads, the MPX would require a raft of special permits, including the signature of a local sheriff, before a sale was approved and logged in a federal registry. But the exhibit was mobbed just the same. As one gun blogger explained it, \"Those little machine guns are like the Lamborghinis at a car show.\"\nAdvertisement:\nI was mentally cataloguing the problems with this analogy when I overheard a Sig Sauer sales rep effuse about the number of MPX preorders due for delivery this summer. \"We're running two shifts up at the factory,\" he said. \"Day and night, it's the sound of freedom.\"\n}}

{{When China's Red Army asked the U.S. for a favor Psst. Can you spare twenty million dollars to bribe some treasonous puppets?\nOnly two items have been uploaded to the \"library\" at the Frog In a Well collaborative Chinese history blog so far, but the most recent, a five-page letter dated January 1945 from the Chinese Communist Red Army general Zhu De asking for a \"favor\" of 20 million dollars from U.S. General Alfred Wedemeyer, makes one lust for more. Every historian digging through archives -- in this case the \"Confidential Records of the Department of State\" -- should be armed with a portable scanner and should, as a matter of principle, upload to the Internet whatever of interest he or she finds.\nWhy? Because it pleases me.\nAdvertisement:\nMy dear General Wedemeyer: I have a favor that I wish to ask you. In order to destroy the puppet forces and obtain victory over the enemy, we now wish to suggest that your army lend us twenty million dollars in United States currency. This army will assume full responsibility for the repayment of this sum following the victorious conclusion of the war against Japan.\"\nThe puppet forces to which Zhu De refers were Chinese soldiers more-or-less aligned with the Japanese invaders. Konrad Lawson, the doctoral student in history who discovered the letter describes them as \"treasonous troops\" who \"sometimes worked closely with the Japanese, sometimes launched campaigns to suppress Communist and other insurgency forces, sometimes engaged in wild banditry, but more often than not, tried to stay alive and carefully monitor which way the wind was blowing in the war.\"\nAccording to Zhu De's letter, in January 1945 there were about 900,000 puppet troops, comprising \"a very powerful force assisting the Japanese.\" But with a little financial help from the Americans, Zhu De was convinced these fickle foes could be bribed to cause all kinds of trouble for their ostensible Japanese overlords. The money could pay for \"using puppets for destruction of such things as hangars, airfields, aircraft, military depots, arsenals, and military factories, mines, railway stations, bridges, wharves, ships, trucks, tunnels, blockhouses and various other military installations,\" as well \"to assassinate Japanese officers of the Army, Navy and Air forces.\"\nLawson could find no evidence that Wedemeyer, the commanding general of United States forces in the China theater, ever responded to Zhu De's entreaty. History informs us that the U.S. ended up backing the losing side in the Chinese Civil War that immediately followed the \"victorious conclusion of the war against Japan.\" But fans of alternate history could well wonder, what might have happened if the U.S. had agreed to help out? Could a loan have fostered closer relations with the Chinese Communists? Could the whole course of modern Chinese history have shifted? What if the U.S. had jettisoned Chiang Kai-shek? Would an alliance between the U.S. and the Chinese Communists have mitigated or avoided the disasters that followed, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution?\nThat way lies madness, of course. Instead all we are left with is the historical irony of comparing the cordial words of General Zhu De -- \"I have a favor that I wish to ask of you\" -- with the far more challenging rhetoric, delivered in July 2005, by another General Zhu, Zhu Chenghu, variously identified as either the nephew or grandson of Zhu De. This General Zhu sent shockwaves across the world when he told the Wall Street Journal that \"if the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons,\" and that \"we [...] will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xian. Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds ... of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.\"\n}}

This means bearded soldiers may not serve as CBRN officers or specialists.\nA beard accommodation also may be temporarily suspended when a specific or concrete threat of exposure to toxic CBRN agents requires all soldiers to be clean-shaven, including those with medical profiles, according to the directive.\nIn addition to these changes, the directive from Fanning also allows female soldiers to wear dreadlocks or locks in accordance with existing grooming standards for braids, cornrows and twists.\n}}

{{FORT BLISS, Texas \u2014 A prototype to counter unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS) using capabilities already in the Army inventory is now being put to the test at the service's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE).\nThe NIE is a soldier-led evaluation that assesses how to integrate programs of record into and progress the Army's tactical network. The evaluation, set to take place at Fort Bliss, Texas, over two weeks starting at the beginning of May, includes testing how well the C-UAS Mobile Integrated Capability (CMIC) works within the network and how it fares in the hands of soldiers.\nThe Army acknowledges the UAS threat will only grow as the systems become increasingly affordable and can be obtained through a few simple clicks on the Internet.\n\"We see that as kind of a poor man's air force,\" Michael Cochran, the Fires liaison officer at Fort Bliss, told Defense News April 26 as the NIE prepared to kick off.\nUsing the C-UAS CMIC, \"we can put a capability in soldiers' hands using existing equipment that they have, so really what we are doing is we are taking existing programs of record and repurposing it to give the ability to counter those UAS,\" he said.\nTo make its prototype, the Army selected a vehicle already used by the service's fire support teams, the Q-50 Counterfire Radar System and the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR).\nThe only piece of new equipment is Northrop Grumman's Venom mast, which transmits Q-50 radar information and supports the LLDR.\nThe Army added the capability to track air vehicle threats to the Q-50 radar, which traditionally tracks rockets, artillery and mortars.\nThe radar will detect a threat, send a signal to the vehicle \u2014 through the mast, up to the LLDR \u2014 which will slew on the target. The system is connected to the Army's command and control systems. A soldier can then decide how to take out the target, according to Cochran.\nThe Army's C-UAS CMIC system is an example of what Pentagon officials and members of Congress alike want to see more \u2014 using what it has in innovative ways and taking the initiative to rapidly develop prototypes.\n}}

{{The Army\u2019s 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade left for Afghanistan last week, the first deployment in a new train-advise-assist model that the service hopes to build on with larger organizational units, the Army staff\u2019s director of force management said Friday.\nWith a goal to create five active-duty and one reserve SFAB, brigades could be organized under new parent commands, which would then cooperate with their counterparts in partner countries, Brig. Gen. Brian Mennes told an audience at the Washington Institute.\n\u201cWe have a vision of creating two security force assistance divisions and corps that would do the bonding from the adviser teams at the corps level, let\u2019s say, of the Afghan army,\u201d Mennes said. \u201cFolks that would be in tune with the intimate force management issues that would have to be created, enhanced to support future army.\u201d\nThe SFAB concept is not new for the Army, in that groups of soldiers in a range of organizational structures have been training, advising and assisting local forces in countries around the world for the better part of the last century.\nBut the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan showed the service that the mission is most definitely a long-term commitment, and so is creating a dedicated brigade with an associated school and its own heraldry.\nThe test will be whether 1st SFAB and its counterparts will be able to succeed where others have stagnated, particularly in Afghanistan, which has struggled to organize and professionalize a national military and police force.\n\u201cThe U.S. needs to stabilize fragile states cheaply \u2014 in blood, in treasure, in time,\u201d said Mara Karlin, the associate director of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cBuilding a military is \u2014 like all state building efforts \u2014 a political, not a technical, exercise.\u201d\nSoldiers in the Army\u2019s new 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade are already deployed to Afghanistan.

He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the rescue of 571 Bataan prisoners of war from the Cabanatuan Prison Camp January 31, 1945.\u201d\nPrince was only 25 when he was hand-picked by a man he deeply admired, Lt. Col. Henry Mucci, to lead 120 Rangers of the 6th Ranger Battalion, Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas to rescue POWs from a Japanese prison camp near the town of Cabanatuan.\nThe raid was fraught with urgency. It had to be quickly and stealthily carried out behind enemy lines, because the Japanese War Ministry had issued a \u201ckill all policy\u201d to cover up war crimes by executing witnesses, in this case prisoners.\nThey had to get in and get out, and did. The highly successful Jan. 30, 1945 mission, portrayed in a 2005 film \u201cThe Great Raid,\u201d was quickly heralded across the U.S. Mucci, Prince, nine other Rangers and their wives were sent on war bonds campaigns, and to meet with President Franklin Roosevelt.\nThe Rangers\u2019 moment in history faded from the public eye, eclipsed with the invasion of Iwo Jima a month later.\nMucci and Prince both received the Army\u2019s highest award, the Distinguished Service Cross, which next only to the Medal of Honor is the nation\u2019s second highest award for valor. The two also were named to the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame.\nPrince, originally from Seattle\u2019s Madrona neighborhood, returned home to Seattle and his wife Barbara, leaving the Army as a major in February 1946.\nThe couple settled in Wenatchee where they raised two sons and focused on getting on with their lives. Prince\u2019s son, Jim, has said his dad never talked about the war or the mission to him or his brother until once, when their mom urged Prince to tell them.\nPrince carved out a business career marketing Washington apples in Seattle and Wenatchee for 40 years. He retired in 1985 as president of Gwin, White and Prince Inc., and held several leadership positions in the fruit Industry.\nHe and his wife Barbara retired in Kirkland until 2003, when Barbara died, and Prince moved to a condominium in Port Townsend to be near his family.\nPrince not only knew war as a veteran but as a parent. A son, Spc. 4 Stephen Robert Prince, was killed in action Aug. 11, 1969 near Quang Ngai, Vietnam while serving with the Army\u2019s 11th Light Infantry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. Stephen Prince had graduated from Wenatchee High School and attended the University of Washington before he was drafted.\nIn addition to his son, Jim, Prince is survived by daughter-in-law Mardee Stadshaug, grandchildren Amy Murray and Andrew Prince, and a brother, John, of Seattle. He was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dick of Seattle.\nAfter several books and the 2005 film rekindled interest in the famous raid that Prince had planned for Mucci, Prince was known to correspond with admirers who sought him out. In 2005, he was invited to speak in 2005 at a Ranger function at Fort Lewis.\nP-I readers in 2005 also responded to an interview Prince gave at the time, including many from the Philippines expressing gratitude as well as relatives of the prisoners the Rangers freed.\n\u201cMy father was one of the 500 men whose lives were saved and I would very much like to thank him,\u201d one woman wrote to the P-I, wanting to connect with Prince.\n\u201cAs I sat in the theater watching \u201cThe Great Raid\u201d it occurred to me that I would not have been born had it not been for those wonderful men who risked their lives to liberate the men of Cabanatuan. My father came back home, married my mother and was twice elected (to local political office in Mississippi,)\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cUnforturnately, he was deeply scarred from his experiences at the hands of the Japanese and at the age of 42, he committed suicide. I was 9 at the time and my sister was 5. It was such a tragedy and a waste as he was a good man with so much potential.\u201d\nPrince understood what she was talking about, which is why he deflected credit for the valor the Rangers showed that day.\nHis admiration, he always said, was for those he helped to liberate. They included many who had survived the Bataan Death March from the war\u2019s beginning through years of captivity.\nIn an Apr. 16, 1945 interview Prince gave to the P-I while home on leave, he said:\n\u201cPeople everywhere thank me. I think the thanks should go the other way. I\u2019ll be grateful the rest of my life that I had a chance to do something in this war that was not destructive.

{{In the last few decades there has been an enormous shift in the capitalist economy in the direction of the globalization of production. Much of the increase in manufacturing and even services production that would have formerly taken place in the global North\u2014as well as a portion of the North\u2019s preexisting production\u2014is now being offshored to the global South, where it is feeding the rapid industrialization of a handful of emerging economies. It is customary to see this shift as arising from the economic crisis of 1974\u201375 and the rise of neoliberalism\u2014or as erupting in the 1980s and after, with the huge increase in the global capitalist labor force resulting from the integration of Eastern Europe and China into the world economy. Yet, the foundations of production on a global scale, we will argue, were laid in the 1950s and 1960s, and were already depicted in the work of Stephen Hymer, the foremost theorist of the multinational corporation, who died in 1974.\nFor Hymer multinational corporations evolved out of the monopolistic (or oligopolistic) structure of modern industry in which the typical firm was a giant corporation controlling a substantial share of a given market or industry. At a certain point in their development (and in the development of the system) these giant corporations, headquartered in the rich economies, expanded abroad, seeking monopolistic advantages\u2014as well as easier access to raw materials and local markets\u2014through ownership and control of foreign subsidiaries. Such firms internalized within their own structure of corporate planning the international division of labor for their products. \u201cMultinational corporations,\u201d Hymer observed, \u201care a substitute for the market as a method of organizing international exchange.\u201d They led inexorably to the internationalization of production and the formation of a system of \u201cinternational oligopoly\u201d that would increasingly dominate the world economy.1\nIn his last article, \u201cInternational Politics and International Economics: A Radical Approach,\u201d published posthumously in 1975, Hymer focused on the issue of the enormous \u201clatent surplus-population\u201d or reserve army of labor in both the backward areas of the developed economies and in the underdeveloped countries, \u201cwhich could be broken down to form a constantly flowing surplus population to work at the bottom of the ladder.\u201d Following Marx, Hymer insisted that, \u201caccumulation of capital is, therefore, increase of the proletariat.\u201d The vast \u201cexternal reserve army\u201d in the third world, supplementing the \u201cinternal reserve army\u201d within the developed capitalist countries, constituted the real material basis on which multinational capital was able to internationalize production\u2014creating a continual movement of surplus population into the labor force, and weakening labor globally through a process of \u201cdivide and rule.\u201d2\nA close consideration of Hymer\u2019s work thus serves to clarify the essential point that \u201cthe great global job shift\u201d3 from North to South, which has become such a central issue in our time, is not to be seen so much in terms of international competition, deindustrialization, economic crisis, new communication technologies\u2014or even such general phenomena as globalization and financialization\u2014though each of these can be said to have played a part. Rather, this shift is to be viewed as the result primarily of the internationalization of monopoly capital, arising from the global spread of multinational corporations and the concentration and centralization of production on a world scale. Moreover, it is tied to a whole system of polarization of wages (as well as wealth and poverty) on a world scale, which has its basis in the global reserve army of labor.\nThe international oligopolies that increasingly dominate the world economy avoid genuine price competition, colluding instead in the area of price. For example, Ford and Toyota and the other leading auto firms do not try to undersell each other in the prices of their final products\u2014since to do so would unleash a destructive price war that would reduce the profits of all of these firms. With price competition\u2014the primary form of competition in economic theory\u2014for the most part banned, the two main forms of competition that remain in a mature market or industry are: (1) competition for low cost position, entailing reductions in prime production (labor and raw material) costs, and (2) what is known as \u201cmonopolistic competition,\u201d that is, oligopolistic rivalry directed at marketing or the sales effort.4\nIn terms of international production it is important to understand that the giant firms constantly strive for the lowest possible costs globally in order to expand their profit margins and reinforce their degree of monopoly within a given industry. This arises from the very nature of oligopolistic rivalry. As Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School wrote in his Competitive Strategy in 1980:\nHaving a low-cost position yields the firm above-average returns in its industry\u2026. Its cost position gives the firm a defense against rivalry from competitors, because its lower costs mean that it can still earn returns after its competitors have competed away their profits through rivalry\u2026. Low cost provides a defense against powerful suppliers by providing more flexibility to cope with input cost increases. The factors that lead to a low cost-position usually also provide substantial entry barriers in terms of scale economies or cost advantages.5\nThis continuous search for low-cost position and higher profit margins led, beginning with the expansion of foreign direct investment in the 1960s, to the \u201coffshoring\u201d of a considerable portion of production. This, however, required the successful tapping of huge potential pools of labor in the third world to create a vast low-wage workforce. The expansion of the global labor force available to capital in recent decades has occurred mainly as a result of two factors: (1) the depeasantization of a large portion of the global periphery by means of agribusiness\u2014removing peasants from the land, with the resulting expansion of the population of urban slums; and (2) the integration of the workforce of the former \u201cactually existing socialist\u201d countries into the world capitalist economy. Between 1980 and 2007 the global labor force, according to the International Labor Organisation (ILO), grew from 1.9 billion to 3.1 billion, a rise of 63 percent\u2014with 73 percent of the labor force located in the developing world, and 40 percent in China and India alone.6\nThe change in the share of \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d (referred to here as the global South, although it includes some Eastern European nations), in world industrial employment, in relation to \u201cdeveloped countries\u201d (the global North) can be seen in Chart 1. It shows that the South\u2019s share of industrial employment has risen dramatically from 51 percent in 1980 to 73 percent in 2008. Developing country imports as a proportion of the total imports of the United States more than quadrupled in the last half of the twentieth century.7\nNotes: \u201cIndustrial employment\u201d is a broad category that includes mining, manufacturing, utilities (electricity, gas, and water supply), and construction. From 2003 to 2007, manufacturing and mining averaged 58.1 percent of total industrial employment in the United States, while in China the ratio was 75.2 percent (see \u201cTable 4b. Employment by 1-digit sector level [ISIC-Rev.3, 1990]\u201d). Based on the two largest economies, therefore, the broad category of \u201cindustrial employment\u201d systematically understates the extent to which the world share of manufacturing has grown in developing countries. Classification of countries as \u201cdeveloping\u201d (South) and \u201cdeveloped\u201d (North) is taken from UNCTAD. The sample averaged 83 countries over the entire period and there were breaks in the country-level series depending on ILO data availability. For example, data were only available for India in 2000 and 2005, and this explains the spikes in these two years.\nSources: ILO, \u201cKey Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM), Sixth Edition,\u201d Software Package (Geneva: International Labour Organization, 2009); UNCTAD, \u201cCountries, Economic groupings,\u201d UNCTAD Statistical Databases Online, http:\/\/unctadstat.unctad.org (Geneva: Switzerland, 2011), generated June 28, 2011.\nThe result of these global megatrends is the peculiar structure of the world economy that we find today, with corporate control and profits concentrated at the top, while the global labor force at the bottom is confronted with abysmally low wages and a chronic insufficiency of productive employment. Stagnation in the mature economies and the resulting financialization of accumulation have only intensified these tendencies by helping to drive what Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley dubbed \u201cglobal labor arbitrage,\u201d i.e., the system of economic rewards derived from exploiting the international wage hierarchy, resulting in outsized returns for corporations and investors.8\nOur argument here is that the key to understanding these changes in the imperialist system (beyond the analysis of the multinational corporation itself, which we have discussed elsewhere)9 is to be found in the growth of the global reserve army\u2014as Hymer was among the first to realize. Not only has the growth of the global capitalist labor force (including the available reserve army) radically altered the position of third world labor, it also has had an effect on labor in the rich economies, where wage levels are stagnant or declining for this and other reasons. Everywhere multinational corporations have been able to apply a divide and rule policy, altering the relative positions of capital and labor worldwide.\nMainstream economics is not of much help in analyzing these changes. In line with the Panglossian view of globalization advanced by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, most orthodox economists see the growth of the global labor force, the North-South shift in jobs, and the expansion of international low-wage competition as simply reflecting an increasingly \u201cflat world\u201d in which economic differences (advantages\/disadvantages) between nations are disappearing.10 As Paul Krugman, representing the stance of orthodox economics, has declared: \u201cIf policy makers and intellectuals think it is important to emphasize the adverse effects of low-wage competition [for developed countries and the global economy], then it is at least equally important for economists and business leaders to tell them they are wrong.\u201d Krugman\u2019s mistaken reasoning here is based on the assumption that wages will invariably adjust to productivity growth, and the inevitable result will be a new world-economic equilibrium.11 All is for the best in the best of all capitalist worlds. Indeed, if there are worries in the orthodox economic camp in this respect, they have to do, as we shall see, with concerns about how long the huge gains derived from global labor arbitrage can be maintained.12\nIn sharp contrast, we shall develop an approach emphasizing that behind the phenomenon of global labor arbitrage lies a new global phase in the development of Marx\u2019s \u201cabsolute general law of capitalist accumulation,\u201d according to which:\nThe greater the social wealth, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and therefore also the greater the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productivity of its labour, the greater is the industrial reserve army\u2026. But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour-army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to the amount of torture it has to undergo in the form of labour. The more extensive, finally, the pauperized sections of the working class and the industrial reserve army, the greater is official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation.13\n\u201cNowadays\u2026the field of action of this \u2018law,\u2019\u201d as Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy stated in 1986,\nis the entire global capitalist system, and its most spectacular manifestations are in the third world where unemployment rates range up to 50 percent and destitution, hunger, and starvation are increasingly endemic. But the advanced capitalist nations are by no means immune to its operation: more than 30 million men and women, in excess of 10 percent of the available labor force, are unemployed in the OECD countries; and in the United States itself, the richest of them all, officially defined poverty rates are rising even in a period of cyclical upswing.14\nThe new imperialism of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries is thus characterized, at the top of the world system, by the domination of monopoly-finance capital, and, at the bottom, by the emergence of a massive global reserve army of labor. The result of this immense polarization, is an augmentation of the \u201cimperialist rent\u201d extracted from the South through the integration of low-wage, highly exploited workers into capitalist production. This then becomes a lever for an increase in the reserve army and the rate of exploitation in the North as well.15\nMarx and the General Law of Accumulation\nIn addressing the general law of accumulation, it is important first to take note of a common misconception directed at Marx\u2019s tendential law. It is customary for establishment critics to attribute to Marx\u2014on the basis of one or at most two passages taken out of context\u2014what these critics have dubbed as an \u201cimmiseration theory\u201d or a \u201cdoctrine of ever-increasing misery.\u201d16 Illustrative of this is John Strachey in his 1956 book Contemporary Capitalism, the larger part of which was devoted to polemicizing against Marx on this point. Strachey repeatedly contended that Marx had \u201cpredicted\u201d that real wages would not rise under capitalism, so that workers\u2019 average standard of living must remain constant or decline\u2014presenting this as a profound error on Marx\u2019s part. However, Strachey, together with all subsequent critics who have advanced this view, managed only to provide a single partial sentence in Capital (plus one early on in The Communist Manifesto\u2014not one of Marx\u2019s economic works) as purported evidence for this. Thus in the famous summary paragraph on the \u201cexpropriation of the expropriators\u201d at the end of volume one, Marx (as quoted by Strachey) wrote: \u201cWhile there is thus a progressive diminution in the number of the capitalist magnates (who usurp and monopolise all the advantages of this transformative process) there occurs a corresponding increase in the mass of poverty, oppression, enslavement, degeneration and exploitation\u2026.\u201d17\nHardly resounding proof of a crude immiseration thesis! Marx\u2019s point rather was that the system is polarized between the growing monopolization of capital by a relatively smaller number of individual capitals at the top and the relative impoverishment of the great mass of people at the bottom. This passage said nothing about the movement of real wages. Moreover, Strachey deliberately excluded the sentence immediately preceding the one he quoted, in which Marx indicated that he was concerned in this context not simply with the working class of the rich countries but with the entire capitalist world and the global working class\u2014or as he put it, \u201cthe entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world market, and, with this, the growth of the international character of the capitalist regime.\u201d Indeed, the \u201ckernel of truth\u201d to the \u201ctheory of immiseration,\u201d Roman Rosdolsky wrote in The Making of Marx\u2019s \u2018Capital\u2019, lay in the fact that such tendencies towards an absolute increase in human misery can be found \u201cin two spheres: firstly (temporary) in all times of crisis, and secondly (permanent) in the so-called underdeveloped areas of the world.\u201d18\nFar from being a crude theory of immiseration, Marx\u2019s general law was an attempt to explain how the accumulation of capital could occur at all: that is, why the growth in demand for labor did not lead to a continual rise in wages, which would squeeze profits and cut off accumulation. Moreover, it served to explain: (1) the functional role that unemployment played in the capitalist system; (2) the reason why crisis was so devastating to the working class as a whole; and (3) the tendency towards the pauperization of a large part of the population. Today it has its greatest significance in accounting for \u201cglobal labor arbitrage,\u201d i.e., capital\u2019s earning of enormous monopolistic returns or imperial rents by shifting certain sectors of production to underdeveloped regions of the world to take advantage of the global immobility of labor, and the existence of subsistence (or below subsistence) wages in much of the global South.\nAs Fredric Jameson recently noted in Representing Capital, despite the \u201cmockery\u201d thrown at Marx\u2019s general law of accumulation in the early post-Second World War era, \u201cit is\u2026no longer a joking matter.\u201d Rather, the general law highlights \u201cthe actuality today of Capital on a world scale.\u201d19\nIt is therefore essential to take a close examination of Marx\u2019s argument. In his best-known single statement on the general law of accumulation, Marx wrote:\nIn proportion as capital accumulates, the situation of the worker, be his payment high or low, must grow worse.\u2026 The law which always holds the relative surplus population in equilibrium with the extent and energy of accumulation rivets the worker to capital more firmly than the wedges of Hephaestus held Prometheus to the rock. It makes an accumulation of misery a necessary condition, corresponding to the accumulation of wealth. Accumulation at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, the torment of labour, slavery, ignorance, brutalization and moral degradation at the opposite pole, i.e. on the side of the class that produces its own product as capital [italics added].20\nBy pointing to an \u201cequilibrium\u201d between accumulation of capital and the \u201crelative surplus population\u201d or reserve army of labor, Marx was arguing, that under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions the growth of accumulation is able to proceed unhindered only if it also results in the displacement of large numbers of workers. The resulting \u201credundancy\u201d of workers checks any tendency toward a too rapid rise in real wages which would bring accumulation to a halt. Rather than a crude theory of \u201cimmiseration,\u201d then, the general law of accumulation highlighted that capitalism, via the constant generation of a reserve army of the unemployed, naturally tended to polarize between relative wealth at the top and relative poverty at the bottom\u2014with the threat of falling into the latter constituting an enormous lever for the increase in the rate of exploitation of employed workers.\nMarx commenced his treatment of the general law by straightforwardly observing, as we have noted, that the accumulation of capital, all other things being equal, increased the demand for labor. In order to prevent this growing demand for labor from contracting the available supply of workers, and thereby forcing up wages and squeezing profits, it was necessary that a counterforce come into being that would reduce the amount of labor needed at any given level of output. This was accomplished primarily through increases in labor productivity with the introduction of new capital and technology, resulting in the displacement of labor. (Marx specifically rejected the classical \u201ciron law of wages\u201d that saw the labor force as determined primarily by population growth.) In this way, by \u201cconstantly revolutionizing the instruments of production,\u201d the capitalist system is able, no less constantly, to reproduce a relative surplus population or reserve army of labor, which competes for jobs with those in the active labor army.21 \u201cThe industrial reserve army,\u201d Marx wrote, \u201cduring periods of stagnation and average prosperity, weighs down the active army of workers; during the period of over-production and feverish activity, it puts a curb on their pretensions. The relative surplus population is therefore the background against which the law of the demand and supply of labour does its work. It confines the field of action of this law to the limits absolutely convenient to capital\u2019s drive to exploit and dominate the workers.\u201d22\nIt followed that if this essential lever of accumulation were to be maintained, the reserve army would need to be continually restocked so as to remain in a constant (if not increasing) ratio to the active labor army. While generals won battles by \u201crecruiting\u201d armies, capitalists won them by \u201cdischarging the army of workers.\u201d23\nIt is important to note that Marx developed his well-known analysis of the concentration and centralization of capital as part the argument on the general law of accumulation. Thus the tendency toward the domination of the economy by bigger and fewer capitals, was as much a part of his overall argument on the general law as was the growth of the reserve army itself. The two processes were inextricably bound together.24\nMarx\u2019s breakdown of the reserve army of labor into its various components was complex, and was clearly aimed both at comprehensiveness and at deriving what were for his time statistically relevant categories. It included not only those who were \u201cwholly unemployed\u201d but also those who were only \u201cpartially employed.\u201d Thus the relative surplus population, he wrote, \u201cexists in all kinds of forms.\u201d Nevertheless, outside of periods of acute economic crisis, there were three major forms of the relative surplus population: the floating, latent, and stagnant. On top of that there was the whole additional realm of official pauperism, which concealed even more elements of the reserve army.\nThe floating population consisted of workers who were unemployed due to the normal ups and downs of accumulation or as a result of technological unemployment: people who have recently worked, but who were now out of work and in the process of searching for new jobs. Here Marx discussed the age structure of employment and its effects on unemployment, with capital constantly seeking younger, cheaper workers. So exploitative was the work process that workers were physically used up quickly and discarded at a fairly early age well before their working life was properly over.25\nThe latent reserve army was to be found in agriculture, where the demand for labor, Marx wrote, \u201cfalls absolutely\u201d as soon as capitalist production has taken it over. Hence, there was a \u201cconstant flow\u201d of labor from subsistence agriculture to industry in the towns: \u201cThe constant movement towards the towns presupposes, in the countryside itself, a constant latent surplus population, the extent of which only becomes evident at those exceptional times when its distribution channels are wide open. The wages of the agricultural labourer are therefore reduced to a minimum, and he always stands with one foot already in the swamp of pauperism.\u201d26\nThe third major form of the reserve army, the stagnant population, formed, according to Marx, \u201ca part of the active reserve army but with extremely irregular employment.\u201d This included all sorts of part-time, casual (and what would today be called informal) labor. The wages of workers in this category could be said to \u201csink below the average normal level of the working class\u201d (i.e., below the value of labor power). It was here that the bulk of the masses ended up who had been \u201cmade \u2018redundant\u2019\u201d by large-scale industry and agriculture. Indeed, these workers represented \u201ca proportionately greater part\u201d of \u201cthe general increase in the [working] class than the other elements\u201d of the reserve army.\nThe largest part of this stagnant reserve army was to be found in \u201cmodern domestic industry,\u201d which consisted of \u201coutwork\u201d carried out through the agency of subcontractors on behalf of manufacture, and dominated by so-called \u201ccheap labor,\u201d primarily women and children. Often such \u201coutworkers\u201d outweighed factory labor in an industry. For example, a shirt factory in Londonderry employed 1,000 workers but also had another 9,000 outworkers attached to it stretched out over the countryside. Here the most \u201cmurderous side of the economy\u201d was revealed.27\nFor Marx, pauperism constituted \u201cthe lowest sediment of the relative surplus population\u201d and it was here that the \u201cprecarious\u2026condition of existence\u201d of the entire working population was most evident. \u201cPauperism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the hospital of the active labor-army and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army.\u201d Beyond the actual \u201clumpenproletariat\u201d or \u201cvagabonds, criminals, prostitutes,\u201d etc., there were three categories of paupers. First, those who were able to work, and who reflected the drop in the numbers of the poor in every period of industrial prosperity, when the demand for labor was greatest. These destitute elements employed only in times of prosperity were an extension of the active labor army. Second, it included orphans and pauper children, who in the capitalist system were drawn into industry in great numbers during periods of expansion. Third, it encompassed \u201cthe demoralized, the ragged, and those unable to work, chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for adaptation, an incapacity that arises from the division of labour; people who have lived beyond the worker\u2019s average life-span; and the victims of industry whose number increases with the growth of dangerous machinery, of mines, chemical workers, etc., the mutilated, the sickly, the widows, etc.\u201d Such pauperism was a creation of capitalism itself, \u201cbut capital usually knows how to transfer these [social costs] from its own shoulders to those of the working class and the petty bourgeoisie.\u201d28\nThe full extent of the global reserve army was evident in periods of economic prosperity, when much larger numbers of workers were temporarily drawn into employment. This included foreign workers. In addition to the sections of the reserve armies mentioned above, Marx noted that Irish workers were drawn into employment in English industry in periods of peak production\u2014such that they constituted part of the relative surplus population for English production.29 The temporary reduction in the size of the reserve army in comparison to the active labor army at the peak of the business cycle had the effect of pulling up wages above their average value and squeezing profits\u2014though Marx repeatedly indicated that such increases in real wages were not the principal cause of crises in profitability, and never threatened the system itself.30\nDuring an economic crisis, many of the workers in the active labor army would themselves be made \u201credundant,\u201d thereby increasing the numbers of unemployed on top of the normal reserve army. In such periods, the enormous weight of the relative surplus population would tend to pull wages down below their average value (i.e., the historically determined value of labor power). As Marx himself put it: \u201cStagnation in production makes part of the working class idle and hence places the employed workers in conditions where they have to accept a fall in wages, even below the average.\u201d31 Hence, in times of economic crisis, the working class as an organic whole, encompassing the active labor army and the reserve army, was placed in dire conditions, with a multitude of people succumbing to hunger and disease.\nMarx was unable to complete his critique of political economy, and consequently never wrote his projected volume on world trade. Nevertheless, it is clear that he saw the general law of accumulation as extending eventually to the world level. Capital located in the rich countries, he believed, would take advantage of cheaper labor abroad\u2014and of the higher levels of exploitation in the underdeveloped parts of the world made possible by the existence of vast surplus labor pools (and non-capitalist modes of production). In his speech to the Lausanne Congress of the First International in 1867 (the year of the publication of the first volume of Capital) he declared: \u201cA study of the struggle waged by the English working class reveals that, in order to oppose their workers, the employers either bring in workers from abroad or else transfer manufacture to countries where there is a cheap labor force. Given this state of affairs, if the working class wishes to continue its struggle with some chance of success, the national organisations must become international.\u201d32\nThe reality of unequal exchange, whereby, in Marx\u2019s words, \u201cthe richer country exploits the poorer, even where the latter gains by the exchange,\u201d was a basic, scientific postulate of classical economy, to be found in both Ricardo and J.S. Mill. These higher profits were tied to the cheapness of labor in poor countries\u2014attributable in turn to underdevelopment, and a seemingly unlimited labor supply (albeit much of it forced labor). \u201cThe profit rate,\u201d Marx observed, \u201cis generally higher there [in the colonies] on account of the lower degree of development, and so too is the exploitation of labour, through the use of slaves, coolies, etc.\u201d In all trade relations, the richer country was in a position to extract what were in effect \u201cmonopoly profits\u201d (or imperial rents) since \u201cthe privileged country receives more labour in exchange for less,\u201d while inversely, \u201cthe poorer country gives more objectified labour in kind than it receives.\u201d Hence, as opposed to a single country where gains and losses evened out, it was quite possible and indeed common, Marx argued, for one nation to \u201ccheat\u201d another. The growth of the relative surplus population, particularly at the global level, represented such a powerful influence in raising the rate of exploitation, in Marx\u2019s conception, that it could be seen as a major \u201ccounterweight\u201d to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, \u201cand in part even paralyse[s] it.\u201d33\nThe one classical Marxist theorist who made useful additions to Marx\u2019s reserve army analysis with respect to imperialism was Rosa Luxemburg. In The Accumulation of Capital she argued that in order for accumulation to proceed \u201ccapital must be able to mobilise world labour power without restriction.\u201d According to Luxemburg, Marx had been too \u201cinfluenced by English conditions involving a high level of capitalist development.\u201d Although he had addressed the latent reserve in agriculture, he had not dealt with the drawing of surplus labor from non-capitalist modes of production (e.g., the peasantry) in his description of the reserve army. However, it was mainly here that the surplus labor for global accumulation was to be found. It was true, Luxemburg acknowledged, that Marx discussed the expropriation of the peasantry in his treatment of \u201cso-called primitive accumulation,\u201d in the chapter of Capital immediately following his discussion of the general law. But that argument was concerned primarily with the \u201cgenesis of capital\u201d and not with its contemporary forms. Hence, the reserve army analysis had to be extended in a global context to take into account the enormous \u201csocial reservoir\u201d of non-capitalist labor.34\nGlobal Labor Arbitrage\nThe pursuit of \u201can ever extended market\u201d Marx contended, is an \u201cinner necessity\u201d of the capitalist mode of production.35 This inner necessity took on a new significance, however, with the rise of monopoly capitalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The emergence of multinational corporations, first in the giant oil companies and a handful of other firms in the early twentieth century, and then becoming a much more general phenomenon in the post-Second World War years, was a product of the concentration and centralization of capital on a world scale; but equally involved the transformation of world labor and production.\nIt was the increasing multinational corporate dominance over the world economy, in fact, that led to the modern concept of \u201cglobalization,\u201d which arose in the early 1970s as economists, particularly those on the left, tried to understand the way in which the giant firms were reorganizing world production and labor conditions.36 This was clearly evident by the early 1970s\u2014not only in Hymer\u2019s work, but also in Richard Barnet and Ronald M\u00fcller\u2019s influential 1974 work, Global Reach, in which they argued: \u201cThe rise of the global corporation represents the globalization of oligopoly capitalism.\u201d This was \u201cthe culmination of a process of concentration and internationalization that has put the world economy under the substantial control of a few hundred business enterprises which do not compete with one another according to the traditional rules of the market.\u201d Moreover, the implications for labor were enormous. Explaining how oligopolistic rivalry now meant searching for the lowest unit labor costs worldwide, Barnet and M\u00fcller argued that this had generated \u201cthe \u2018runaway shop\u2019 which becomes the \u2018export platform\u2019 in an underdeveloped country,\u201d and which had become a necessity of business for U.S. companies, just like their European and Japanese competitors.37\nOver the past half century, these global oligopolies have been offshoring whole sectors of production from the rich\/high-wage to the poor\/low-wage countries, transforming global labor conditions in their search for global low-cost position, and in a divide and rule approach to world labor. Leading U.S. multinationals, such as General Electric, Exxon, Chevron, Ford, General Motors, Proctor and Gamble, IBM, Hewlett Packard, United Technologies, Johnson and Johnson, Alcoa, Kraft, and Coca Cola now employ more workers abroad than they do in the United States\u2014even without considering the vast number of workers they employ through subcontractors. Some major corporations, such as Nike and Reebok, rely on third world subcontractors for 100 percent of their production workforce\u2014with domestic employees confined simply to managerial, product development, marketing, and distribution activities.38 The result has been the proletarianization, often under precarious conditions, of much of the population of the underdeveloped countries, working in massive export zones under conditions dictated by foreign multinationals.\nTwo realities dominate labor at the world level today. One is global labor arbitrage or the system of imperial rent. The other is the existence of a massive global reserve army, which makes this world system of extreme exploitation possible. \u201cLabour arbitrage\u201d is defined quite simply by The Economist as \u201ctaking advantage of lower wages abroad, especially in poor countries.\u201d It is thus an unequal exchange process in which one country, as Marx said, is able to \u201ccheat\u201d another due to the much higher exploitation of labor in the poorer country.39 A study of production in China\u2019s industrialized Pearl River Delta region (encompassing Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong) found in 2005 that some workers were compelled to work up to sixteen hours continuously, and that corporal punishment was routinely employed as a means of worker discipline. Some 200 million Chinese are said to work in hazardous conditions, claiming over a 100,000 lives a year.40\nIt is such superexploitation that lies behind much of the expansion of production in the global South.41 The fact that this has been the basis of rapid economic growth for some emerging economies does not alter the reality that it has generated enormous imperial rents for multinational corporations and capital at the center of the system. As labor economist Charles Whalen has written, \u201cThe prime motivation behind offshoring is the desire to reduce labor costs\u2026a U.S.-based factory worker hired for $21 an hour can be replaced by a Chinese factory worker who is paid 64 cents an hour\u2026. The main reason offshoring is happening now is because it can.\u201d42\nHow this system of global labor arbitrage occurs by way of global supply chains, however, is enormously complex. Dell, the PC assembler, purchases some 4,500 parts from 300 different suppliers in multiple countries around the world.43 As the Asian Development Bank Institute indicated in a 2010 study of iPhone production: \u201cIt is almost impossible [today] to define clearly where a manufactured product is made in the global market. This is why on the back of iPhones one can read \u2018Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in China.\u2019\u201d Although both statements on the back of the iPhones are literally correct, neither answers the question of where the real production takes place. Apple does not itself manufacture the iPhone. Rather the actual manufacture (that is, everything but its software and design) takes place primarily outside the United States. The production of iPhone parts and components is carried out principally by eight corporations (Toshiba, Samsung, Infineon, Broadcom, Numonyx, Murata, Dialog Semiconductor, and Cirrus Logic), which are located in Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States. All of the major parts and components of the iPhone are then shipped to the Shenzhen, China plants of Foxconn (a company headquartered in Taipei) for assembly and export to the United States.\nApple\u2019s enormous, complex global supply chain for iPod production is aimed at obtaining the lowest unit labor costs (taking into consideration labor costs, technology, etc.), appropriate for each component, with the final assembly taking place in China, where production occurs on a massive scale, under enormous intensity, and with ultra-low wages. In Foxconn\u2019s Longhu, Shenzhen factory 300,000 to 400,000 workers eat, work, and sleep under horrendous conditions, with workers, who are compelled to do rapid hand movements for long hours for months on end, finding themselves twitching constantly at night. Foxconn workers in 2009 were paid the minimum monthly wage in Shenzhen, or about 83 cents an hour. (Overall in China in 2008 manufacturing workers were paid $1.36 an hour, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.)\nDespite the massive labor input of Chinese workers in assembling the final product, their low pay means that their work only amounts to 3.6 percent of the total manufacturing cost (shipping price) of the iPhone. The overall profit margin on iPhones in 2009 was 64 percent. If iPhones were assembled in the United States\u2014assuming labor costs ten times that in China, equal productivity, and constant component costs\u2014Apple would still have an ample profit margin, but it would drop from 64 percent to 50 percent. In effect, Apple makes 22 percent of its profit margin on iPhone production from the much higher rate of exploitation of Chinese labor.44\nOf course in stipulating a mere tenfold difference in wages between the United States and China, in its calculation of the lower profit margins to be gained with United States as opposed to Chinese assembly, the Asian Development Bank Institute was adopting a very conservative assumption. Overall Chinese manufacturing workers in 2008, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, received only 4 percent of the compensation for comparable work in the United States, and 3 percent of that in the European Union.45 In comparison, hourly manufacturing wages in Mexico in 2008 were about 16 percent of the U.S. level.46\nIn spite of the low-wage \u201cadvantage\u201d of China, some areas of Asia, such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, have hourly compensation levels still lower, leading to a divide and rule tendency for multinational corporations\u2014commonly acting through subcontractors\u2014to locate some sectors of production, such as light industrial textile production, primarily in these still lower wage countries. Thus the New York Times indicated in July 2010, that Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based company \u201cthat handles sourcing and apparel manufacturing for companies like Wal-Mart and Liz Claiborne\u201d increased its production in Bangladesh by 20 percent in 2010, while China, its biggest supplier, slid 5 percent. Garment workers in Bangladesh earned around $64 a month, compared \u201cto minimum wages in China\u2019s coastal industrial provinces ranging from $117 to $147 a month.\u201d47\nFor multinational corporations there is a clear logic to all of this. As General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt stated, the \u201cmost successful China strategy\u201d\u2014with China here clearly standing for global labor arbitrage in general\u2014\u201cis to capitalize on its market growth while exporting its deflationary power.\u201d This \u201cdeflationary power\u201d has to do of course with lower labor costs (and lower costs of reproduction of labor in the North through the lowering of the costs of wage-consumption goods). It thus represents a global strategy for raising the rate of surplus value (widening profit margins).48\nToday Marx\u2019s reserve army analysis is the basis, directly and indirectly (even in corporate circles) for ascertaining how long the extreme exploitation of low-wage workers in the underdeveloped world will persist. In 1997 Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, presented an influential paper entitled \u201cEmerging Economies: How Long Will the Low-Wage Advantage Last?\u201d He pointed out that international wage differentials were enormous, with labor costs for spinning and weaving in rich countries exceeding that of the lowest wage countries (Pakistan, Madagascar, Kenya, Indonesia, and China) by a factor of seventy-to-one in straight dollar terms, and ten-to-one in terms of purchasing power parity (taking into account the local cost of living).\nThe central issue from the standpoint of global capital, Lindbaek indicated, was China, which had emerged as an enormous platform for production, due to its ultra-low wages and seemingly unlimited supply of labor. The key strategic question then was, \u201cHow long will China\u2019s low wage advantage last?\u201d His answer was that China\u2019s \u201cenormous \u2018reserve army of labor\u2019\u2026will be released gradually as agricultural productivity improves and jobs are created in the cities.\u201d Looking at various demographic factors, including the expected downward shift in the number of working-age individuals beginning in the second decade of the twenty-first century, Lindbaek indicated that real wages in China would eventually rise above subsistence. But when?49\nIn mainstream economics, the analysis of the role of surplus labor in holding down wages in the global South draws primarily on W. Arthur Lewis\u2019s famous article \u201cEconomic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour,\u201d published in 1954. Basing his argument on the classical economics of Adam Smith and Marx (relying in fact primarily on the latter), Lewis argued that in third world countries with vast, seemingly \u201cunlimited\u201d supplies of labor, capital accumulation could occur at a high rate while wages remained constant and at subsistence level. This was due to the very high reserve army of labor, including \u201cthe farmers, the casuals, the petty traders, the retainers (domestic and commercial), women in the household, and population growth.\u201d Although Lewis (in his original article on the subject) erroneously confined Marx\u2019s own reserve army concept to the narrow question of technological unemployment\u2014claiming on this basis that Marx was wrong on empirical grounds\u2014he in fact adopted the broader framework of Marx\u2019s reserve army analysis as his own. Thus he pointed to the enormous latent surplus population in agriculture. He also turned to Marx\u2019s notion of primitive accumulation, to indicate how the depeasantization of the non-capitalist sector might take place.\nLewis, however, is best known within mainstream economics for having argued that eventually a turning point would occur. At some point capital accumulation would exceed the supply of surplus labor (primarily from a slowdown in internal migration from the countryside) resulting in a rise in the real wages of workers in industry. As he put it, \u201cthe process\u201d of accumulation with \u201cunlimited labor\u201d and hence constant real wages must eventually stop \u201cwhen capital accumulation has caught up with the labour supply.\u201d50\nToday the Lewisian framework, overlapping with Marx\u2019s reserve army theory and in fact derived from it\u2014but propounding the view (which Marx did not) that the reserve army of labor will ultimately be transcended in poor countries as part of a smooth path of capitalist development\u2014is the primary basis on which establishment economics raises the issue of how long global labor arbitrage can last, particularly in relation to China. The concern is whether the huge imperial rents now being received from the superexploitation of labor in the poor countries will rapidly shrink or even disappear. The Economist magazine, for example, worries that a Lewisian turning point, combined with growing labor revolts in China, will soon bring to an end the huge surplus profits from the China trade. Chinese workers \u201cin the cities at least,\u201d it complains, \u201care now as expensive as their Thai or Filipino peers.\u201d \u201cThe end of surplus labor,\u201d The Economist declares, \u201cis not an event, but a process. And that process may already be under way.\u201d A whole host of factors, such as demography, the stability of Chinese rural labor with its family plots, and the growing organization of workers, may cause labor constraints to come into play earlier than had been expected. At the very least, The Economist suggests, the enormous gains of capital in the North that occurred \u201cbetween 1997 and 2005 [when] the price of Chinese exports to America fell by more than 12%\u201d are unlikely to be repeated. And if wages in China rise, cutting into imperial rents, where will multinational corporations turn? \u201cVietnam is cheap: its income per person is less than a third of China\u2019s. But its pool of workers is not that deep.\u201d51\nWriting in Monthly Review, economist Minqi Li notes that since the early 1980s 150 million workers in China have migrated from rural to urban areas. China thus experienced a 13 percentage-point drop (from 50 percent to 37 percent) in the share of wages in GDP between 1990 and 2005. Now \u201cafter many years of rapid accumulation, the massive reserve army of cheap labor in China\u2019s rural areas is starting to become depleted.\u201d Li focuses mainly on demographic analysis, indicating that China\u2019s total workforce is expected to peak at 970 million by 2012, and then decline by 30 million by 2020, with the decline occurring more rapidly among the prime age working population. This he believes will improve the bargaining power of workers and strengthen industrial strife in China, raising issues of radical transformation. Such industrial strife will inevitably mount if China\u2019s non-agricultural population passes \u201cthe critical threshold of 70 percent by around 2020.\u201d52\nOthers think that global labor arbitrage with respect to China is far from over. Yang Yao, an economist at Peking University, argues that \u201cthe countryside still has 45% of China\u2019s labour force,\u201d a huge reserve army of hundreds of millions, much of which will become available to industry as mechanization proceeds. Stephen Roach has observed that with Chinese wages at 4 percent of U.S. wages, there is \u201cbarely\u2026a dent in narrowing the arbitrage with major industrial economies\u201d\u2014while China\u2019s \u201chourly compensation in manufacturing\u201d is \u201cless than 15% of that elsewhere in East Asia\u201d (excluding Japan), and well below that of Mexico.53\nThe Global Reserve Army\nIn order to develop a firmer grasp of this issue it is crucial to look both empirically and theoretically at the global reserve army as it appears in the current historical context\u2014and then bring to bear the entire Marxian critique of imperialism. Without such a comprehensive critique, analyses of such problems as the global shift in production, the global labor arbitrage, deindustrialization, etc., are mere partial observations suspended in mid-air.\nThe data on the global workforce compiled by the ILO conforms closely to Marx\u2019s main distinctions with regard to the active labor army and the reserve army of labor. In the ILO picture of the world workforce in 2011, 1.4 billion workers are wage workers\u2014many of whom are precariously employed, and only part-time workers. In contrast, the number of those counted as unemployed worldwide in 2009 consisted of only 218 million workers. (In order to be classified as unemployed, workers need to have actively pursued job searches in the previous few weeks). The unemployed, in this sense, can be seen as conforming roughly to Marx\u2019s \u201cfloating\u201d portion of the reserve army.\nA further 1.7 billion workers are classified today as \u201cvulnerably employed.\u201d This is a residual category of the \u201ceconomically active population,\u201d consisting of all those who work but are not wage workers\u2014or part of the active labor army in Marx\u2019s terminology. It includes two categories of workers: \u201cown\u2013account workers\u201d and \u201ccontributing family workers.\u201d\n\u201cOwn-account workers,\u201d according to the ILO, encompasses workers engaged in a combination of \u201csubsistence and entrepreneurial activities.\u201d The urban component of the \u201cown-account workers\u201d in third-world countries is primarily made up of workers in the informal sector, i.e. street workers of various kinds, while the agricultural component consists largely of subsistence agriculture. \u201cThe global informal working class,\u201d Mike Davis observed in Planet of the Slums, \u201cis about one billion strong, making it the fastest-growing, and most unprecedented, social class on earth.\u201d54\nThe second category of the vulnerably employed, \u201ccontributing family workers,\u201d consists of unpaid family workers. For example, in Pakistan \u201cmore than two-thirds of the female workers that entered employment during 1999\/00 to 2005\/06 consisted of contributing family workers.\u201d55\nThe \u201cvulnerably employed\u201d thus includes the greater part of the vast pools of underemployed outside official unemployment rolls, in poor countries in particular. It reflects the fact that, as Michael Yates writes, \u201cIn most of the world, open unemployment is not an option; there is no safety net of unemployment compensation and other social welfare programs. Unemployment means death, so people must find work, no matter how onerous the conditions.\u201d56 The various components of vulnerably employed workers correspond to what Marx described as the \u201cstagnant\u201d and \u201clatent\u201d portions of the reserve army.\nAdditionally, many individuals of working age are classified as not belonging to the economically active population, and thus as economically inactive. For the prime working ages of 25\u201354 years this adds up, globally, to 538 million people in 2011. This is a very heterogeneous grouping including university students, primarily in wealthier countries; the criminal element engendered at the bottom of the capitalist economy (what Marx called the lumpenproletariat); discouraged and disabled workers, who have been marginalized by the system; and in general what Marx called the pauperized portion of the working class\u2014that portion of working age individuals, \u201cthe demoralized, the ragged,\u201d and the disabled, who have been almost completely shut out of the labor force. It is here, he argued, that one finds the most \u201cprecarious\u2026condition of existence.\u201d Officially designated \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d are a significant number of would-be workers. According to the ILO, if discouraged workers are included in Botswana\u2019s unemployment rate in 2006 it nearly doubles from 17.5 percent to 31.6 percent.57\nIf we take the categories of the unemployed, the vulnerably employed, and the economically inactive population in prime working ages (25\u201354) and add them together, we come up with what might be called the maximum size of the global reserve army in 2011: some 2.4 billion people, compared to 1.4 billion in the active labor army. It is the existence of a reserve army that in its maximum extent is more than 70 percent larger than the active labor army that serves to restrain wages globally, and particularly in the poorer countries. Indeed, most of this reserve army is located in the underdeveloped countries of the world, though its growth can be seen today in the rich countries as well. The breakdown in percentages of its various components can be seen in Chart 2.\nChart 2. The Global Workforce and the Global Reserve Army\nNotes: The Proportion of \u201cvulnerably employed\u201d and \u201cunemployed\u201d were estimated based on percentages from the \u201cGlobal Employment Trends\u201d reports cited below. The chart includes total world population (15 years and over) excluding the economically inactive population less than 25- and greater than 54-years of age.\nSources: International Labour Office (ILO), \u201cEconomically Active Population Estimates and Projections (5th edition, revision 2009),\u201d LABORSTA Internet (Geneva: International Labour Organisation, 2009); ILO \u201cGlobal Employment Trends,\u201d 2009, 2010 and 2011 (Geneva: International Labour Office).\nThe enormous reserve army of labor depicted in Chart 2 is meant to capture its maximum extent. Some will no doubt be inclined to argue that many of the workers in the vulnerably employed do not belong to the reserve army, since they are peasant producers, traditionally thought of as belonging to non-capitalist production\u2014including subsistence workers who have no relation to the market. It might be contended that these populations are altogether outside the capitalist market. Yet, this is hardly the viewpoint of the system itself. The ILO classifies them generally, along with informal workers, as \u201cvulnerably employed,\u201d recognizing they are economically active and employed, but not wage workers. From capital\u2019s developmental standpoint, the vulnerably employed are all potential wage workers\u2014grist for the mill of capitalist development. Workers engaged in peasant production are viewed as future proletarians, to be drawn more deeply into the capitalist mode.\nIn fact, the figures we provide for the maximum extent of global reserve army, in an attempt to understand the really-existing relative surplus population, might be seen in some ways as underestimates. In Marx\u2019s conception, the reserve army also included part-time workers. Yet, due to lack of data, it is impossible to include this element in our global reserve army estimates. Further, figures on the economically inactive population\u2019s share of the reserve army include only prime age workers between 24 and 54 years of age without work, and exclude all of those ages 16\u201323 and 55\u201365. Yet, from a practical standpoint, in most countries, those in these ages too need and have a right to employment.\nDespite uncertainties related to the ILO data, there can be no doubt about the enormous size of the global reserve army. We can understand the implications of this more fully by looking at Samir Amin\u2019s analysis of \u201cWorld Poverty, Pauperization, and Capital Accumulation\u201d in Monthly Review in 2003. Amin argued that \u201cModern capitalist agriculture\u2014encompassing both rich, large-scale family farming and agribusiness corporations\u2014is now engaged in a massive attack on third world peasant production.\u201d According to the core capitalist view propounded by the WTO, the World Bank, and the IMF, rural (mostly peasant) production is destined to be transformed into advanced capitalist agriculture on the model of the rich countries. The 3 billion plus rural workers would be replaced in the ideal capitalist scenario, as Amin puts it, by some \u201ctwenty million new modern farmers.\u201d\nIn the dominant view, these workers would then be absorbed by industry, primarily in urban centers, on the model of the developed capitalist countries. But Britain and the other European economies, as Amin and Indian economist Prabhat Patnaik point out, were not themselves able to absorb their entire peasant population within industry. Rather, their surplus population emigrated in great numbers to the Americas and to various colonies. In 1820 Britain had a population of 12 million, while between 1820 and 1915 emigration was 16 million. Put differently, more than half the increase in British population emigrated each year during this period. The total emigration from Europe as a whole to the \u201cnew world\u201d (of \u201ctemperate regions of white settlement\u201d) over this period was 50 million.\nWhile such mass emigration was a possibility for the early capitalist powers, which moved out to seize large parts of the planet, it is not possible for countries of the global South today. Consequently, the kind of reduction in peasant population currently pushed by the system points, if it were effected fully, to mass genocide. An unimaginable 7 percent annual rate of growth for fifty years across the entire global South, Amin points out, could not absorb even a third of this vast surplus agricultural population. \u201cNo amount of economic growth,\u201d Yates adds, will \u201cabsorb\u201d the billions of peasants in the world today \u201cinto the traditional proletariat, much less better classes of work.\u201d\nThe problem of the absorption of the massive relative surplus population in these countries becomes even more apparent if one looks at the urban population. There are 3 billion plus people who live in urban areas globally, concentrated in the massive cities of the global South, in which people are crowded together under increasingly horrendous, slum conditions. As the UN Human Settlements Programme declared in The Challenge of the Slums: \u201cInstead of being a focus of growth and prosperity, the cities have become a dumping ground for a surplus population working in unskilled, unprotected and low-wage informal service industries and trade.\u201d\nFor Amin, all of this is tied to an overall theory of unequal exchange\/imperialist rent. The \u201cconditions governing accumulation on a world scale\u2026reproduce unequal development. They make clear that underdeveloped countries are so because they are superexploited and not because they are backward.\u201d The system of imperialist rent associated with such superexploitation, reaches its mature form and is universalized with the development of \u201cthe later capitalism of the generalized, financialized, and globalized oligopolies.\u201d58\nPrabhat Patnaik has developed a closely related perspective, focusing on the reserve army of labor in The Value of Money and other recent works. He begins by questioning the standard economic view that it is low labor productivity rather than the existence of enormous labor reserves that best explains the impoverishment of countries in the global South. Even in economies that have experienced accelerated growth and rising productivity, such as India and China, he argues, \u201clabour reserves continue to remain non-exhausted.\u201d This is because with the high rate of productivity growth (and labor displacement) associated with the shift toward production of high-technology goods, \u201cthe rate of growth of labour demand\u2026does not adequately exceed the rate of growth of labor supply\u201d\u2014adequately enough, that is, to draw down the labor reserves sufficiently, and thus to pull wages up above the subsistence level. An illustration of the productivity dynamic and how it affects labor absorption can be seen in the fact that, despite rock-bottom wages in China, Foxconn is planning to introduce a million robots in its plants within three years as part of its strategy of displacing workers in simple assembly operations. Foxconn currently employs a million workers in mainland China, many of whom assemble iPhones and iPads.\nPatnaik\u2019s argument is clarified by his use of a dual reserve army model: the \u201cprecapitalist-sector reserve army\u201d (inspired by Luxemburg\u2019s analysis) and the \u201cinternal reserve army.\u201d In essence, capitalism in China and India is basing its exports more and more on high-productivity, high-technology production, which means the displacement of labor, and the creation of an expanding internal reserve army. Even at rapid rates of growth therefore it is impossible to absorb the precapitalist-sector reserve army, the outward flow of which is itself accelerated by mechanization.59\nAside from the direct benefits of enormously high rates of exploitation, which feed the economic surplus flowing into the advanced capitalist countries, the introduction of low-cost imports from \u201cfeeder economies\u201d in Asia and other parts of the global South by multinational corporations has a deflationary effect. This protects the value of money, particularly the dollar as the hegemonic currency, and thus the financial assets of the capitalist class. The existence of an enormous global reserve army of labor thus forces income deflation on the world\u2019s workers, beginning in the global South, but also affecting the workers of the global North, who are increasingly subjected to neoliberal \u201clabour market flexibility.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s phase of imperialism\u2014which Patnaik identifies with the development of international finance capital\u2014\u201cwages in the advanced countries cannot rise, and if anything tend to fall in order to make their products more competitive\u201d in relation to the wage \u201clevels that prevail in the third world.\u201d In the latter, wage levels are no higher, \u201cthan those needed to satisfy some historically-determined subsistence requirements,\u201d due to the existence of large labor reserves. This logic of world exploitation is made more vicious by the fact that \u201ceven as wages in the advanced countries fall, at the prevailing levels of labor productivity, labor productivity in third world countries moves up, at the prevailing level of wages, towards the level reached in the advanced countries. This is because the wage differences that still continue to exist induce a diffusion of activities from the former to the latter. This double movement means that the share of wages in total world output decreases,\u201d while the rate of exploitation worldwide rises.60\nWhat Patnaik has called \u201cthe paradox of capitalism\u201d is traceable to Marx\u2019s general law of accumulation: the tendency of the system to concentrate wealth while expanding relative (and even absolute) poverty. \u201cIn India, precisely during the period of neoliberal reforms when output growth rates have been high,\u201d Patnaik notes,\nthere has been an increase in the proportion of the rural population accessing less than 2400 calories per person per day (the figure for 2004 is 87 percent). This is also the period when hundreds of thousands of peasants, unable to carry on even simple reproduction, have committed suicide. The unemployment rate has increased, notwithstanding a massive jump in the rate of capital accumulation; and the real wage rate, even of the workers in the organized sector, has at best stagnated, notwithstanding massive increases in labor productivity. In short our own experience belies Keynesian optimism about the future of mankind under capitalism.61\nIn the advanced capitalist countries, the notion of \u201cprecariousness,\u201d which Marx in his reserve army discussion employed to describe the most pauperized sector of the working class, has been rediscovered, as conditions once thought to be confined to the third world, are reappearing in the rich countries. This has led to references to the emergence of a \u201cnew class\u201d\u2014though in reality it is the growing pauperized sector of the working class\u2014termed the \u201cprecariat.\u201d62\nAt the bottom of this precariat developing in the rich countries are so-called \u201cguest workers.\u201d As Marx noted, in the nineteenth century, capital in the wealthy centers is able to take advantage of lower-wage labor abroad either through capital migration to low-wage countries, or through the migration of low-wage labor into rich countries. Although migrant labor populations from poor countries have served to restrain wages in rich countries, particularly the United States, from a global perspective the most significant fact with respect to workers migrating from South to North is their low numbers in relation to the population of the global South.\nOverall the share of migrants in total world population has shown no appreciable change since the 1960s. According to the ILO, there was only \u201ca very small rise\u201d in the migration from developing to developed countries \u201cin the 1990s, and\u2026this is accounted for basically by increased migration from Central American and Caribbean countries to the United States.\u201d The percentage of adult migrants from developing to developed countries in 2000 was a mere 1 percent of the adult population of developing countries. Moreover, those migrants were concentrated among the more highly skilled so that \u201cthe effect of international migration on the low-skilled labour force\u201d in developing countries themselves \u201chas been negligible for the most part\u2026. Migration from developing to developed countries has largely meant brain drain\u2026. In short,\u201d the ILO concludes, \u201climited as it was, international migration\u201d in the decade of the 1990s \u201cserved to restrain the growth of skill intensity of the labour force in quite a large number of developing countries, and particularly in the least developed countries.\u201d All of this drives home the key point that capital is internationally mobile, while labor is not.63\nIf the new imperialism has its basis in the superexploitation of workers in the global South, it is a phase of imperialism that in no way can be said to benefit the workers of the global North, whose conditions are also being dragged down\u2014both by the disastrous global wage competition introduced by multinationals, and, more fundamentally, by the overaccumulation tendencies in the capitalist core, enhancing stagnation, and unemployment.64\nIndeed, the wealthy countries of the triad (the United States, Europe, and Japan) are all bogged down in conditions of deepening stagnation, resulting from their incapacity to absorb all of the surplus capital that they are generating internally and pulling in from abroad\u2014a contradiction which is manifested in weakening investment and employment. Financialization, which helped to boost these economies for decades, is now arrested by its own contradictions, with the result that the root problems of production, which financial bubbles served to cover up for a time, are now surfacing. This is manifesting itself not only in diminishing growth rates, but also rising levels of excess capacity and unemployment. In an era of globalization, financialization, and neoliberal economic policy, the state is unable effectively to move in to correct the problem, and is increasingly geared simply to bailing out capital, at the expense of the rest of society\nThe imperial rent that these countries appropriate from the rest of the world only makes the problems of surplus absorption or overaccumulation at the center of the world system worse. \u201cForeign investment, far from being an outlet for domestically generated surplus,\u201d Baran and Sweezy famously wrote in Monopoly Capital, \u201cis a most efficient process for transferring surplus generated from abroad to the investing country. Under these circumstances, it is of course obvious that foreign investment aggravates rather than helps to solve the surplus absorption problem.\u201d65\nThe New Imperialism\nAs we have seen, there can be no doubt about the sheer scale of the relative shift of world manufacturing to the global South in the period of the internationalization of monopoly capital since the Second World War\u2014and accelerating in recent decades. Although this is often seen as a post-1974 or a post-1989 phenomenon, Hymer, Magdoff, Sweezy, and Amin captured the general parameters of this broad movement in accumulation and imperialism, associated with the development of multinational corporations (the internationalization of monopoly capital) as early as the 1970s. Largely as a result of this epochal shift in the center of gravity of world manufacturing production toward the South, about a dozen emerging economies have experienced phenomenal growth rates of 7 percent or more for a quarter century.\nMost important among these of course is China, which is not only the most populous country but has experienced the fastest growth rates, reputedly 9 percent or above. At a 7 percent rate of growth an economy doubles in size every ten years; at 9 percent every eight years. Yet, the process is not, as mainstream economics often suggests, a smooth one. The Chinese economy has doubled in size three times since 1978, but wages remain at or near subsistence levels, due to an internal reserve army in the hundreds of millions. China may be emerging as a world economic power, due to its sheer size and rate of growth, but wages remain among the lowest in the world. India\u2019s per capita income, meanwhile, is one-third of China\u2019s. China\u2019s rural population is estimated at 45\u201350 percent, while India\u2019s is around 70 percent.66\nOrthodox economic theorists rely on an abstract model of development that assumes all countries pass through the same phases, and eventually move up from labor-intensive manufacturing to capital-intensive, knowledge-intensive production. This raises the issue of the so-called \u201cmiddle-income transition\u201d that is supposed to occur at a per capita income of somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 (China\u2019s per capita income at current exchange rates is about $3,500). Countries in the middle-income transition have higher wage rates and are faced with uncompetitiveness unless they can move to products that capture more value and are less labor-intensive. Most countries fail to make the transition and the middle-income level ends up being a developmental trap. Based on this framework, New York University economist Michael Spence argues in The Next Convergence that China\u2019s \u201clabor-intensive export sectors that have been a major contributor to growth are losing competiveness and have to be allowed to decline or move inland and then eventually decline. They will be replaced by sectors that are more capital, human-capital, and knowledge intensive.\u201d67\nSpence\u2019s orthodox argument, however, denies the reality of contemporary China, where the latent reserve army in agriculture alone amounts to hundreds of millions of people. Moving toward a less labor-intensive system under capitalism means higher rates of productivity and technological displacement of labor, requiring that the economy absorb a mounting reserve army by conquering ever-larger, high-value-capture markets. The only cases where anything resembling this has taken place\u2014aside from Japan, which first emerged as a rapidly expanding, militarized-imperialist economy in the early twentieth century\u2014were the Asian tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong), which were able to expand their external export markets for high value-capture production in the global North during a period of world economic expansion (not the deepening stagnation of today). This is unlikely to prove possible for China and India, which must find employment between them for some 40 percent of the world\u2019s labor force\u2014and to a mounting degree in the urban industrial sector. Unlike Europe during its colonial period the emigration of large pools of surplus labor as an escape valve is not possible: they have nowhere to go. China\u2019s capacity to promote internal-based accumulation (not relying primarily on export markets), meanwhile, is hindered under today\u2019s capitalist conditions by this same reserve army of low-paid labor, and by rapidly rising inequality.\nAll of this suggests that at some point the contradictions of China\u2019s unprecedented accumulation rates combined with massive labor reserves that cannot readily be absorbed by the accumulation process\u2014particularly with the growing shift to high-technology, high-productivity production\u2014are bound to come to a head.\nMeanwhile, international monopoly capital uses its combined monopolies over technology, communications, finance, military, and the planet\u2019s natural resources to control (or at least constrain) the direction of development in the South.68\nAs the contradictions between North and South of the world system intensify, so do the internal contradictions within them\u2014with class differences widening everywhere. The relative \u201cdeindustrialization\u201d in the global North is now too clear a tendency to be altogether denied. Thus the share of manufacturing in U.S. GDP has dropped from around 28 percent in the 1950s to 12 percent in 2010, accompanied by a dramatic decrease in its share (along with that of the OECD as a whole) in world manufacturing.69 Yet, it is important to understand that this is only the tip of the iceberg where the growing worldwide destabilization and overexploitation of labor is concerned.\nIndeed, one should never forget the moral barbarism of a system that in 1992 paid Michael Jordan $20 million to market Nikes\u2014an amount equal to the total payroll of the four Indonesian factories involved in the production of the shoes, with women in these factories earning only 15 cents an hour and working eleven-hour days.70 Behind this lies the international \u201csourcing\u201d strategies of increasingly monopolistic multinational corporations. The field of operation of Marx\u2019s general law of accumulation is now truly global, and labor everywhere is on the defensive.\nThe answer to the challenges facing world labor that Marx gave at the Lausanne Congress in 1867 remains the only possible one: \u201cIf the working class wishes to continue its struggle with some chance of success the national organisations must become international.\u201d It is time for a new International.71\nNotes\n}}

{{OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso\u2019s military has launched an investigation after a rights group accused the army of carrying out executions during a recent operation in which it said it had killed nearly 150 militants, the government said on Thursday.\nThe army said in February it had killed 146 militants in response to an attack on civilians, part of a broader response to worsening Islamist and interethnic violence across northern Burkina since last year.\nHuman Rights Watch said later that some of those killed were executed in front of their families. On Wednesday, a local rights group cited witnesses as saying 60 of the dead had been summarily executed.\nAnalysts are concerned that such abuse could fuel spiraling instability in previously peaceful Burkina.

The state of emergency was extended by six months in January after an outbreak of ethnic violence killed dozens.\nAbuses by state forces present a dilemma for Western powers, including former colonial master France and the United States, which have deployed thousands of troops to West Africa\u2019s Sahel region to help local governments counter al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked groups.\n(The story corrects spelling of rights activist\u2019s surname in paragraph 9)\n}}

The binocular design allows for greater depth perception and more realistic viewing.\nThe Army's new Enhanced Night Vision Goggles-Binocular uses wireless technology to merge the weapon sight with day\/night vision, thermal and augmented reality to the soldier's view. Sgt. 1st Class Clint Nelson demonstrates the augmented reality portion of the equipment development at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. (Army)\nHe described standard land navigation in which a soldier shoots an azimuth with his or her compass and map and follows that line to the objective, adjusting around and over obstacles and re-shooting the azimuth to stay on course.\n\u201cThis allows me to plan out my routes in my patrol base and upload the route,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThen (navigation) points move me to the route in the real world. I can easily walk around, go completely off my azimuth. I\u2019m no longer looking down at a phone or a map.\u201d\nHe explained how these devices can help a soldier process massive amounts of data, especially in an urban operation.\nAdvancements in night-vision technology will eliminate the need for soldiers to look down at a device, such as the one pictured here, to see around the battlefield. (Army)\n\u201cIn major urban centers, there are a lot of buildings, a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis can also do tracking and reporting. Anyone on the system can populate the enemy, send it to me and it comes up on my screen.\u201d\nThat helps a soldier in a confusing environment make sense of what he or she is seeing and what they\u2019re fellow soldiers are seeing. Identifying threats, friendly forces and enemy targets.\nDonahue said both the Marines and representatives of the special operations community are monitoring the device\u2019s advancement.\n}}

{{The end of the Army fitness test Tired of doing sit ups? The Army is rolling out a whole new physical fitness test across the force in coming years that changes the game completely.\nThe details of when and how have not been worked out yet, but the Army made an historic announcement Monday with the unveiling of a new PT test to replace the long-standing Army Physical Fitness Test.\nThe service will spend the next year hammering out the details of grading and policy for the gender- and age-neutral, six-event Army Combat Fitness Test, but in the meantime, soldiers are bursting with questions about how this test will change not only their exercise routines, but possibly their careers.\n\u201cWhat we know to be true, based on the amount of testing we\u2019ve done, is it\u2019s attainable,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey told Army Times on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not unrealistic.\u201d\nFrom hundreds of Facebook comments, Army Times gathered a few of the most common or popular reactions and brought them to the SMA. This is what he had to say.\nWhat about profiles?\n\u201cWhat are they going to do with people with low back pain and are currently authorized alternative aerobic event and exempted from sit-ups?\u201d wrote Michael Spillane on the Army Times Facebook page. \u201cThe whole profile system will have to be redone as well.\u201d\nEvent alternatives are at the top of the issues to iron out, Dailey said.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Gen. Malcolm Frost said Monday.\n\u201cThe reality is, we do hurt people. I know that. Of course,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s the standard to be a soldier?\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t, then you shouldn\u2019t be a soldier,\u201d he said.\nThe discussion meets directly head-on with the Defense Department\u2019s ongoing discussion about deployability, and a new policy that forces out service members who are in a non-deployable status for more than 12 months.\n\u201cIn no way, shape or form does the sergeant major of the Army ever [imply] that we\u2019re not going to take care of you,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cBut there is no right to wear the uniform that\u2019s guaranteed to anyone. If you\u2019re non-deployable, you\u2019re non-retainable. That\u2019s what our job is.\u201d\nThe days of permanent profiles are on their way out, and fitness for combat will have a more narrow definition with a more rigorous fitness test.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an infinite number of places you can put somebody who\u2019s hurt, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a non-deployable unit.\u201d\nWhat does this have to do with combat?\n\u201cThrow a medicine ball? Because that\u2019s [what] real combat [is] like,\u201d Joshua Johannes wrote on the Army Times Facebook page.\nAccording to Frost, the overhead throw engages similar muscles to lifting a casualty over the shoulder, or tossing a grenade 40 meters.\nThere\u2019s a similar reason for the dead lift.\n\u201cPick up a litter. It\u2019s the exact same movement,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cPick up an artillery round, the ammo cans, the water jugs.\u201d\nDead lifts cause injuries, right?\n\u201cStopped reading at first event being the dead lift,\u201d Ryan T. Alexander wrote on the Army Times Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s like the VA said, \u2018We need to pay out as much disability pay as possible. What\u2019ve you got for us?\u2019 ... \u2018Well, we can make every last soldier do a complicated, heavy lifting exercise with their lower backs.\u2019 \u201c\nArmy vice chief deadlifts 160 lbs. The 160-pound deadlift is a bare minimum requirement to join the Army's combat arms specialties and is part of the Occupational Physical Fitness Assessment. Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville crushed one on the show floor at the 2018 AUSA Global Force Symposium.\nA new test with new events will require a new PT program, officials have said, and taking a year to roll out the new test \u2015 after taking the previous year to create standards and finalize requirements \u2015 should give units an opportunity to train soldiers so they will succeed on the ACFT.\nFrost and Dailey themselves admitted to needing to brush up on their skills when taking the ACFT.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it,\u201d Dailey said Monday. \u201cI just don\u2019t do dead lifts.\u201d\nThat training should prevent lower-back or other injuries, because as soldiers become more aware of the lower body and core strength required for a successful dead lift, the risk of lower back strain should lessen.\nAs far as going into the test, soldiers should have an idea of their max weight from their preparation, Frost said.\nSoldiers will get a practice lift, then do two reps with their chosen weight. But, Frost added, soldiers are not meant to start low for the first rep and then add on.\nHow long is this going to take? And much is it going to cost?\n\u201cLet\u2019s go with a small unit of 100. If you get 10 sets of equipment, this test will take 10 hours,\u201d Stephen Moore wrote on the Army Times Facebook page. \u201cNope, don\u2019t see this one happening.\u201d\nWith a 50-minute run time, Frost said, the test should take about a day per company of soldiers.\n\u201cWhen I was a battalion command sergeant major, it took me seven days to give them the PT test,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cSo what? I did a company a day,\u201d\nThe ACFT will likely take a little longer, he added, but not much.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the price I\u2019m willing \u2014\u2013 the chief, the secretary is willing \u2014\u2013 to pay, to increase the readiness of the United States Army,\u201d he said.\nPart of the key to the APFT was its $0 cost to complete, which will change with a PT test that requires dead lift and pull-up bars, kettle bells and medicine balls.\n\u201cThis PT test for active duty alone is a logistical nightmare,\u201d Scott Atwell wrote on the Army Times Facebook page. \u201cLiterally impossible for an already cash strapped Army Reserve and National Guard.\u201d\nHowever, according to officials, much of this equipment is already available at many units, and will become more and more common as Holistic Health and Fitness initiatives continue to develop.\nWhile it\u2019s true that the equipment involved will cost thousands up-front, leadership expects the overall initial cost to be about $3 per soldier.\nBreaking it down, Frost explained that every battalion will get 15 lanes worth of equipment each, at a cost of about $25,000 each. If you estimate that equipment will last 10 years for roughly a million soldiers, you\u2019re down to about $3 each.\nThat cost, Dailey said, could be offset by a reduction in injuries, obesity and other health issues that the Army wants to tackle through these upgraded PT programs.\n}}

Posted by U.S. Army on Thursday, September 20, 2018\n\u201cWe are very pleased with this decision. Fort Carson provides world class training opportunities for Strykers, and having another Stryker brigade combat team will improve 4th Infantry Division\u2019s lethality,\" said Maj. Gen. Randy A. George, the division commander, in a statement.\nThe 2nd IBCT is currently deployed in separate operations in both Afghanistan and Kosovo.\nThe base of the ABCT relies on the Abrams tank, Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Paladin artillery piece.\nThe move comes after last year\u2019s conversion of the 3rd Infantry Division\u2019s 2nd BCT at Fort Stewart, Georgia, from an infantry brigade to an armored brigade.\nThat will put the Army at a total of 31 BCTs in the regular Army, comprised of 11 armored. 13 infantry and seven Stryker brigades once complete.\nThe Army National Guard will hold 27 BCTs, among them five armored, 20 infantry and two Stryker brigades.\nThis gives the total Army 58 BCTs.\nSoldiers with 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division prepare their M1 Abrams tanks for movement at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, Calif., Feb. 17, 2017.

{{Three years after its completion, a lengthy study of the Army\u2019s role in the Iraq war remains unpublished, some say because of how it both praises certain Army leaders while also airing some \u201cdirty laundry\u201d regarding wartime decision-making.\nA detailed account of the study\u2019s history and current efforts to have it published was reported by the Wall Street Journal this week.\nIn that article, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told the newspaper that he hopes to have the study published by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe owe it to ourselves as an Army to turn the lessons learned as quickly and as accurately as we can, understanding that they are not going to be perfect,\u201d he told the Journal.\nThe study, dubbed \u201cThe United States Army in the Iraq War,\u201d was commissioned by then-Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno in 2013.\nArmy Times contacted the Office of the Chief of Public for more information on when the study would be published and why it wasn\u2019t conducted by the Army Center for Military History.\n\u201cThis paper is not an official history and it is expected to be published by the Army War College in mid-November,\" Cynthia O. Smith, Army spokeswoman, said in an email.\nDays after the Journal report, Reps. Jakie Speier, D-California, and Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, sent a letter addressed to both Milley and Army Secretary Mark Esper about the study.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\nIn a press release accompanying the letter the representatives blasted Army leadership for the delay.\n\u201cThis is simply the Army being unwilling to publicly air its mistakes,\u201d Rep. Speier said. \u201cOur military, Congress, and the American people deserve nothing less than total transparency on the lessons the Army has identified so that we may use those lessons to avoid costly, and too often deadly, mistakes of the past.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the Army and, frankly, our entire defense establishment, made serious mistakes and miscalculations in Iraq since 2003,\u201d Rep. Gallego said. \u201cWe must not endanger the best interests of our country or the lives of future Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines simply to protect the careers and egos of Army brass. This report should be released.\u201d\nIn June 2016, the two-volume, 1,300-page study was complete. But before it had been read outside of Army circles, it already was under fire.\nShane Story, a historian for the Army\u2019s Center for Military History, authored a memo asking whether the study was an attempt to \u201cvalidate the surge,\u201d which would benefit Odierno and retired Gen. David Petraeus, who led U.S. and coalition forces for much of the surge and was widely credited, along with Odierno, for turning around the dire conditions on the ground.\nStory also noted in his memo that the way in which the report was compiled did not follow typical methods of relying heavily on primary documents. He had recommended major revisions before publication.\nRetired Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Dan Allyn told the Journal that delays in releasing the report began after Odierno retired.\n\u201cClearly, there were senior leaders who were in position when these things happened, and there were concerns on how they were portrayed,\u201d Allyn said.\nThough the first volume of the study was set to publish in October 2016, Milley said he planned to read the entire study and write a foreword. He also instructed the team to expand its research by interviewing former ranking officials, he told the Journal.\nThe study team was initially headed by then-Col. Joel Rayburn, who previously worked for Petraeus in Iraq.\nRetired Col. Frank Sobchack took over as study team director as the team completed its findings. He told the Journal that the team worked \u201ctirelessly for three years\u201d on the study to capture the war\u2019s lessons in a readable narrative.\n\u201cThat the Army was paralyzed with apprehension for the past two years over publishing it leaves me disappointed with the institution to which I dedicated my adult life,\u201d he said.\nThe report praises the 2007 troop surge, which Odierno and Petraeus oversaw. As the study was being conducted, some in Army ranks foresaw problems if it wasn\u2019t published before Odierno retired, the Journal reported.\nThe chief of the historical services division for the Army Heritage and Education Center at the Army War College, Conrad Crane, reviewed the study in July 2015.\nIn an email to the team, he told them that publication needed to happen quickly.\n\u201cYou need to get this published while you still have GEN Odierno as a champion. Otherwise I can see a lot of institutional resistance to having so much dirty laundry aired,\u201d Crane wrote.\nSix outside reviewers later described the study as fair and recommended publication.\nThe report points out mistakes made by top leaders during the early stages of the war. Throughout that period, officials assumed that military operations would end within 18 to 24 months and therefore didn\u2019t deploy enough troops.\nTop leaders failed to create a strategy that would limit Iranian and Syrian support for militants inside Iraq.\nThe Journal, which conducted numerous interviews and reviewed internal memorandums and emails, highlighted some of the specific mistakes mentioned in the history. They include:\nThe need for more troops: At no point during the Iraq war did commanders have enough troops to simultaneously defeat the Sunni insurgency and Iranian-backed Shiite militias.\nThe failure to deter Iran and Syria: Iran and Syria gave sanctuary and support to Shiite and Sunni militants, respectively, and the U.S. never developed an effective strategy to stop this.\nCoalition warfare wasn\u2019t successful: The deployment of allied troops had political value but was \u201clargely unsuccessful\u201d because the allies didn\u2019t send enough troops and limited the scope of their operations.\nThe National Guard needs more training: While many National Guard units performed well, some brigades had so much difficulty dealing with insurgents that U.S. commanders stopped assigning them their own battlespace to control. The study found that Guard units need more funding and training. (The Guard said it hadn\u2019t seen the study and declined to comment to the Journal.)\nThe failure to develop self-reliant Iraqi forces: The U.S.-led effort to train and equip Iraqi forces was under-resourced for most of the war. A premature decision to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqis made it harder to blunt political pressure by Iraqi officials on Iraqi commanders.\nAn ineffective detainee policy: The U.S. decided at the outset not to treat captured insurgents or militia fighters as prisoners of war and then never developed an effective way to handle detainees. Many Sunni insurgents were returned to the battlefield.\nDemocracy doesn\u2019t necessarily bring stability: U.S. commanders believed the 2005 Iraqi elections would have a \u201ccalming effect,\u201d but those elections instead exacerbated ethnic and sectarian tensions.\nAdditionally, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Schoomaker went ahead with a brigade combat team restructuring in 2003 and 2004, which shrunk the number of available BCTs, pushing less-proficient Army National Guard units into the fight, the Journal reported.\nIn response, Schoomaker, who retired in 2007, told the Journal that the restructuring made more BCTs available to the force.\nThe report also criticizes then-Gen. George Casey\u2019s decision to consolidate U.S. forces on large bases, which led to a security vacuum around Baghdad. Casey, who led U.S. troops in Iraq for three years before becoming Army chief of staff, did not respond to Journal requests for comment but has previously said that the goal was to shift security responsibilities to the Iraqis.\nThen-Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster called it \u201cby far the best and most comprehensive operational study of the U.S. experience in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.\u201d\n}}

{{(Updated March 1 at 3:10 p.m.)\nA Ranger-qualified, Bronze Star-wearing captain filed suit against the Defense Department on Monday seeking permission to wear a turban and maintain his long hair and beard while in uniform in adherence to his Sikh faith \u2014 a permanent waiver already awarded to at least three other Sikh soldiers.\nArmy lawyers agreed to postpone those tests after being questioned Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell, according to a news release from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm that specializes in cases involving religious freedom and expression.\nThe tests will be delayed until Friday, said a spokesman for the Sikh Coalition, which also has attorneys representing Singh. A final decision on the tests could come Wednesday.\n\"We believe the Court will end the Army's discriminatory ban on observant Sikhs in the military,\" Harsimran Kaur, legal director for the Sikh Coalition, said Monday. \"Sikh Americans have proven time and again that they can serve with honor and excellence.\"\u200b\nThe suit, filed in Washington, D.C., seeks to stop these tests on various grounds, including assertions that they limit Singh's freedom of speech and right to practice his religion.\nAir Force Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a Defense Department spokesman, said via email that DoD \"provides to the maximum extent possible for the free exercise of religion by all members of the military services who choose to do so,\" but that the Pentagon did not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Simratpal Singh shaved his beard and cut his hair before entering the U.S. Military Academy a decade ago, a decision he has regretted, he said. He decided late last year to seek a waiver that would allow him to grow his hair and beard, as well as wear a turban, in adherence to his Sikh faith.\nPhoto Credit: Jovelle Tamayo\/Sikh Coalition\nSingh decided to request a waiver to Army appearance standards in October, the complaint states, about a month before he was scheduled to report to Fort Belvoir. He's removed his turban and cut his hair and beard throughout his career in uniform, beginning with his admission to the U.S. Military Academy. The suit states that he'd inquired about a waiver before beginning classes, but that he'd \"succumbed under pressure\" and adhered to grooming standards.\nIt was a decision Singh \"constantly regretted,\" according to the filing, but one he lived with throughout his time at West Point, graduating in 2010.\nHe completed Ranger School without any special dietary requests, giving the meat included in his rations (many, but not all, Sikhs are vegetarians) to other soldiers and losing 30 pounds in the process, the complaint states. He would earn a Bronze Star for leading more than 150 route clearance patrols in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and added several other commendations throughout his career.\nAfter his initial request for religious accommodation, Singh received temporary waivers that eventually were extended to the end of this month. The suit hopes to make the waivers permanent, similar to those granted to at least three other Sikh Army officers, all in medical professions.\n}}

{{The ISIS launched attacks on the Syrian army positions in Deir Ezzor only 7 minutes after the US-led coalition\u2019s airstrikes on Saturday, a military source said, adding that the air and ground assault were highly coordinated, According to FNA report.\nThe source said after the coalition\u2019s pounding of the Syrian army near Deir Ezzor airbase, the ISIS could take full control of al-Tharda mountain and then Deir Ezzor military base, adding that the army and national defense forces deployed near the airbase immediately won it back from the terrorists by launching a counterattack.\nNoting that Deir Ezzor is now almost in tranquility and no change has occurred in the military map of the region, the source said by attacking the Syrian army positions, the US seeks to prevent military operations to break the terrorists\u2019 siege on the city.\nThe source said the simultaneous raid of the ISIL terrorists immediately after the coalition airstrikes is the best evidence of the high coordination done between the US and the terrorists.\nRussian Defense Ministry said on Saturday that four strikes against Syrian positions had been delivered by US-led coalition aircraft, including two F-16 jet fighters and two A-10 support aircraft.\nThe Syrian military called the bombing a \u201cserious and blatant aggression\u201d against Syrian forces, and said it was \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that the US and its allies support ISIL militants.\nAlso on Sunday, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman blasted Washington over the recent airstrikes near Deir Ezzor, and said such moves serves the interests of the ISIS terror group.\n\u201cIf previously we had suspicions that Fatah al-Sham Front (formerly known as al-Nusra Front) is protected this way, now, after Saturday airstrikes on the Syrian army we come to a really terrifying conclusion for the entire world: The White House is defending the ISIL,\u201d Maria Zakharova said.\n\u201cWe demand a full and detailed explanation from Washington. That explanation must be given at the UN Security Council,\u201d she added.\nRussia has demanded full and detailed explanation from Washington over the incident in Deir Ezzor, in which 62 Syrian troops were killed and over 100 injured.\n}}

{{Evidence on barracks life will not be given at hearing this week into death of Private Geoff Gray, letter claims\nAn inquest into the death of a teenage army recruit has been plunged into controversy ahead of its opening this week. The Ministry of Defence has been forced to deny claims that key internal reports cataloguing life at Deepcut barracks, where four trainee soldiers died from bullet wounds over a seven-year period, will not be submitted as evidence at the inquest into the death of Private Geoff Gray.\nThe 17-year-old died from two gunshot wounds to the head sustained while on guard duty in September 2001. As with the three other trainee deaths, the original inquest recorded a verdict of suicide.\nBut the Gray family have questioned this verdict and campaigned for a second inquest after receiving thousands of pages of material from Surrey police which shone new light on life at the barracks.\nLast year at the pre-inquest review, John Cooper QC, representing his family, said there was evidence of \u201csystemic failings\u201d and a \u201clack of procedure and lack of protection\u201d for recruits at Deepcut.\nCooper added: \u201cHere there is potentially a situation where another trainee pulled the trigger on Mr Gray.\u201d\nDeepcut has been plagued by allegations that recruits were bullied and poorly supervised. It has also been reported that soldiers at the barracks sold army-issue ammunition on the black market and that there was low morale among trainees. There were also tensions between Commonwealth and British soldiers based at the barracks.\nIt is expected that these will be explored in detail during the new inquest. But an anonymous letter, sent to Cooper and obtained by the Observer after an application for disclosure to the coroner, makes a series of incendiary claims about how the inquest will operate.\nThe letter, which was apparently written by someone with detailed knowledge of previous inquests into the deaths of recruits at Deepcut, claims: \u201cIt has been made clear that other source documents detailing the situation in 2001-03 are not to be part of the new evidence regarding the Gray statement for the upcoming inquest and that the statement structure as set out for Benton is to be maintained.\u201d\nThis is a reference to Private Sean Benton, 20, who died at Deepcut in 1995, the same year as Private Cheryl James, 18. Private James Collinson, 17, was the fourth trainee to die at the barracks, in 2002.\nThe letter alleges that witness statements of Brigadier Christopher Coles, head of the Army Personnel Services Group, given at the inquest into Benton\u2019s death, contained flaws and presented \u201cno contemporaneous account of events\u201d. It warns: \u201cMoD is now taking a similar oblique approach for the inquest touching on the death of Private Geoff Gray.\u201d\nIt adds: \u201cThe Army has boxed itself into a corner and do not wish to use the extensive contemporary documentation originating from the heart of Deepcut between 2001-03.\u201d\nAnd it warns that some of those who have been charged with preparing the army\u2019s draft statement for the inquest are \u201cstepping away\u201d from it believing that the \u201cchain of command is deeply embarrassed that it was regularly informed of the stresses and strains at Deepcut and deliberately choose to ignore the information\u201d.\nAny suspicion that the army is suppressing documents could prove explosive when the inquest begins on Tuesday. But the allegation has been strongly rejected by MoD lawyers. Nicholas Moss for the MoD said \u201cthere is no merit in the anonymous letter and there is no truth in the allegations\u201d.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON\u2014 President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he's picked a battle-hardened commander who oversaw troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to be the nation's next top military adviser.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Gen. Mark Milley, who has been chief of the Army since August 2015, would succeed Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford's term doesn't end until Oct. 1. Trump said the date of transition is \"to be determined.\"\nTrump used an early morning tweet to reveal his choice. \"I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country!\" he said.\nDunford is a former commandant of the Marine Corps and commander of coalition troops in Afghanistan. Milley commanded troops during several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nDunford's spokesman, Col. Patrick Ryder, said all indications are that Dunford will serve his full term. Ryder referred other questions to the White House. He said Dunford congratulated Milley on his nomination. \"He has served with Gen. Milley in peacetime and in combat and has the highest regard for his leadership.\"\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that Milley was \"a battle-tested commander and Pentagon reformer who will be a worthy successor\" to Dunford. That committee would consider a Joint Chiefs nomination.\nThe chairman of the House Armed Services Committee praised Milley for his \"direct, insightful military assessments based upon his intellect and years of experience.\" Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, also noted that the Joint Chiefs chairman serves Congress as well as the president and defense secretary.\nTrump's decision, announced before leaving Washington for the annual Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia, had caught some in the Pentagon by surprise when unofficial word spread Friday after he had tweeted that a succession announcement was coming.\nNormally an announcement on a new chairman wouldn't be expected until early next year. Officials had said the Air Force chief, Gen. David Goldfein, was also a strong contender for the job.\nMilley is known as a charismatic, outgoing leader who has not been afraid to offer candid and sometimes blunt assessments to Congress. Last year he admonished the House Armed Services\nCommittee for its inability to approve a defense budget, slamming it as \"professional malpractice.\" In 2016, he told lawmakers, in answer to a direct question, that women should also have to register for the draft now that they are allowed to serve in all combat jobs.\nAs the Army's top leader, he helped shepherd the groundbreaking move of women into front-line infantry and other combat positions, while warning that it would take time to do it right. More recently, he has worked with his senior officers to reverse a shortfall in Army recruiting when the service fell far short of its annual goal this year.\nHe also played a role in one of the Army's more contentious criminal cases. While serving as head of U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Milley was assigned to review the case of former Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who abandoned his post in Afghanistan and was held captive by the Taliban for five years.\nMilley made the early decision to charge Bergdahl with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Bergdahl was eventually found guilty, reduced in rank to private, dishonorably discharged and fined $10,000, but was spared any additional prison time.\nA native of Winchester, Massachusetts, and a fervent supporter of the Boston Red Sox and other city teams, Milley received his Army commission from Princeton University in 1980. An infantry officer by training, he also commanded Special Forces units in a career that included deployments in the invasion of Panama in 1989, the multinational mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina to implement the Dayton Peace Accords, and the Iraq war.\nThe Milley move starts a series of military leadership changes in coming months, including successors in 2019 for Adm. John Richardson as the chief of Naval Operations, Gen. Robert Neller as commandant of the Marine Corps, and Air Force Gen. Paul Selva as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Trump also will pick a replacement for Milley as Army chief.\nGoldfein began his term as Air Force chief of staff in 2016, so wouldn't be expected to step down until the summer of 2020.\n}}

{{The Army is filling ranks by increasing misdemeanor waivers and enlistment bonuses.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Under the gun to increase the size of the force, the Army is issuing more waivers for past drug use or bad conduct by recruits, and pouring an extra $200 million into bonuses this year to attract and retain soldiers.\nAccording to data obtained by The Associated Press, nearly one-third of all the waivers granted by the Army in the first six months of this fiscal year were for conduct and drug problems, mainly involving marijuana use. That number is significantly higher than the other three military services, and represents a steady increase over the past three years.\nAt the same time, the Army increased bonuses by more than 30 percent this year, with enlistment money going to recruits for high-tech jobs such as satellite communications and cryptologists. Recruits in those jobs can get up to an additional $30,000 for a five-year enlistment.\nThe enlistment bonuses grew by $115 million this year over last year, while money to entice soldiers already in the service to stay grew by almost $100 million, according to the Army.\nArmy leaders said there has been no move to reduce enlistment standards in order to meet recruitment goals. They said there are more waivers in part because of the increased competition for recruits as they try to add another 8,000 soldiers to the force this year.\nWaivers have long been used to enlist young people who might otherwise be unqualified for military service due to a wide array of medical, conduct or other reasons. Historically, the bulk of the waivers approved by all four military services involve a broad range of medical issues.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\nWith retention up and recruiting down, here\u2019s how the Army plans to add 7,500 more soldiers to the ranks With a limited recruiting environment, hundreds of reservists jumping to the active component and a healthy economy, the Army has struggled to keep afloat its fiscal 2017 end strength of 1.018 million soldiers.\nThe Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force provided their waiver data upon request in April, but Army officials refused to do so. Ultimately the Defense Department provided totals to The Associated Press for all the services.\nThe data shows that the Army has increasingly brought in recruits that need conduct or drug waivers. In 2016, nearly 19 percent of the waivers were for drug use and conduct, In 2017 that grew to almost 25 percent, and for the first half of 2018 it exceeded 30 percent.\nThose totals far exceed the other three services. According to the Pentagon data, the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force did not approve any waivers for drug use in the last three years. And their use of conduct waivers is significantly less than the Army - hovering between 2-13 percent of all the waivers they approve, depending on the service.\nArmy officials defend the conduct waivers, saying that while a small number may be for major crimes, most involve recruits who faced misdemeanor charges or were ultimately were found guilty of lesser charges or never convicted at all. A waiver is required, for example, even if the recruit was a juvenile and the charge was dismissed after restitution, community service or other conditions were met.\nRecruits who get waivers are then required to pass all other military standards for their job.\nThe Army's annual recruiting mission is 76,500 this year, an increase of 8,000, said Maj. Gen. Joe Calloway, director of military personnel management. The overall size of the Army, now about 992,000, is being increased to more than 1.03 million by late next year.\n\"It is an exceedingly competitive environment,\" said Calloway, adding that the Army will not lower standards to meet the goal. \"We will miss a number before we will do that.\" He said the Army has met about 90 percent of its recruitment goal so far this year.\nThe Marine Corps has faced the same battle for recruits.\n\"It is definitely more challenging now than it has been in the last five years. As unemployment approaches 5 percent, we are in direct competition with the private sector for the same talent,\" said Marine Maj. Gen. Paul Kennedy, who until recently headed Marine recruiting command.\nThe Marines, however, have maintained about the same level of waivers for bad conduct since 2016, which has been roughly 8 percent of approved waivers. And the Marine Corps, the smallest military service, has also cut back on enlistment bonuses - from about $8.2 million in 2017 to $8 million this year.\n\"If you enlist for money, it's harder for them to remain committed when the chips are down,\" said Kennedy. \"We sell intangibles. Our signing bonuses are so small, and it's spread out over the four year enlistment, so they're only getting a few hundred dollars extra.\"\nThe Navy slightly increased its waivers for bad conduct over the past three years, but it still equals less than 13 percent of the total. Meanwhile, the Navy also is tripling the amount of enlistment bonuses this year, to about $100 million. The largest incentives are for sailors going to jobs in the nuclear or cryptology fields or for SEALs and other special operations forces.\nJust 7 percent of the Air Force waivers have been for bad conduct this year, also a small increase. And the Air Force has cut back on enlistment bonuses, from about $19 million to almost $14 million. Instead, bonuses are given more to encourage airmen to stay in the service. Retention bonuses increased a bit this year to $280 million.\nMedical hurdles make up the majority of enlistment waivers across the military. They range from issues as routine as asthma, eyesight, or skin problems to more complex health conditions, such as previous sports injuries that may have healed, but still must be evaluated. For example, if someone received medication for attention deficit disorder in their youth, they need a waiver. Anyone still on the medication would not be allowed to enlist.\n}}

{{FORT BRAGG, N.C. \u2014 The U.S. Army is authorizing $5,000 bonuses to woo top-performing troops into a new training brigade as the service once famous for shouldering the burden of America's wars works to meet the growing demand for advisers in places ranging from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan and Africa.\nThe plan recognizes the new reality of America at war: Army soldiers are more often training and building local security forces rather than doing the fighting for them on foreign soil. It replaces what has been a hodgepodge of programs over the past dozen years with projections for five new, permanent, fully-trained brigades that can be deployed around the world as professional advisers.\n\"It's a recognition that this is an enduring requirement for the conventional Army,\" Gen. Robert Abrams, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Most times we're falling in on existing institutions that are probably failing, and bringing them up to a certain competency level so they can secure themselves. And we've got to be able to do that on a large scale.\"\nThe new program and its signing bonuses also illustrate how the Trump administration has endorsed the Obama administration's emphasis on working \"by, with and through\" local forces. That policy emerged from the deadly and tumultuous years after the 2003 Iraq invasion, when as many as 160,000 American troops were on the ground battling insurgents while struggling to transform a rag-tag mix of often ethnically-opposed Iraqi troops into a functioning fighting force.\nU.S. troops left Iraq in 2011. Less than three years later, the Iraqi security forces largely collapsed as Islamic State militants seized control of large swaths of territory. U.S. troops then returned to Iraq, training, advising and enabling the Iraqis to oust IS from the country.\nThe $5,000 bonus got final authorization on Wednesday and is expected to be available beginning in June. The Army has chosen a colonel to lead the first training brigade and he will travel to a number of military posts in the coming weeks to recruit soldiers for the unit. Joining is strictly voluntary.\nSince it's a new program, Abrams acknowledged some soldiers may be reluctant to shift away from current career paths by taking a chance on something they fear may fail or lose support over time.\n\"There is natural apprehension in the field: 'Is this a flash in the pan?' It's not a flash in the pan,\" Abrams said. \"The chief is committed and the Army senior leadership is committed, I'm committed. This is going to be an enduring capability.\"\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer. Be the first to hear about breaking news, as it happens.

That's where the bonus will help.\nOf the 529 soldiers in the brigade, 360 will be officers who don't qualify for the bonus. The rest will be enlisted soldiers and non-commissioned officers who can earn the extra money.\nThe objective is to fix some problems created by the current training programs. In Iraq and Afghanistan, chunks of combat brigades have been deployed to serve as trainers and advisers to local forces, often leaving the remainder of their units back at home. Right now, for example, portions of three brigades are in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\"It separates the leaders from those they lead, and it degrades (unit) readiness significantly,\" Abrams said, adding that Army leaders have expressed frustrations over breaking units apart to staff the mission.\nThe plan calls for a military assistance training academy to be created at Fort Benning, Georgia. About 90 civilian and military staff members are being recruited. The first class will begin in October.\nMembers of what is being called the new Security Force Assistance Brigade will go through a training course of six-to-eight weeks. Almost 200 will receive 16 weeks of intensive language instruction. Others will get an eight-week language course.\nThe first brigade could be ready to deploy by the end of 2018, Abrams said, but there has been no decision on where they will go. Iraq and Afghanistan are the most likely locations, he said.\nAs more brigades are created, they would deploy to other areas of the world. While the Army initially conceived of one base in each geographical military command around the globe, it's more likely they'll simply be sent where most needed.\n}}

{{Syria, with Russia\u2019s aerial support has been winning in Aleppo and thus it was the US who needed the ceasefire, however Washington was never sincere about the deal and simply used it to re-arm the militants, Canada-based award-winning author, sociologist and geopolitical analyst Mahdi Nazemroaya told Radio Sputnik.\nThe truce which was brokered by the US and Russia is now effectively at an end with the US being to blame, not Russia or Syria, Nazemroaya told Radio Sputnik. It was the US that attacked Syrian land forces, killing over 60 Syrian soldiers and injuring many more, the geopolitical analyst said. The attacks appeared deliberate and were followed by an offensive by Daesh [Islamic State\/ISIL] which was left unhindered. The US Air Force did not even respond to the Daesh offensive, he noted, instead attacking the Syrians. With the ceasefire effectively ending on September 19, the expert then asked what the next actions of the US were?\n\u201cIt asked for the Russian and Syrian Air Forces to be grounded, and said that only the US and its allies should have mastery over the skies of Syria and they are the ones who should be bombing,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cWe see whom they are bombing. They are bombing the Syrian military, they are bombing the legitimate government of Syria and indirectly helping Daesh as well as al-Nusra,\u201d he further stated. Mahdi Nazemroaya explained that what has been happening during these truces was that the US had been using them to arm extremists groups, not just \u201cmoderate rebels.\u201d\n\u201cThe distinction between them is very hazy, I mean the Free Syrian Army and al-Nusra, for example. They are using this opportunity to arm them and we see who is sincere here,\u201d he told Sputnik.\n\u201cWhat I know is that the Syrian side and the Russian side do have humanitarian concerns for the people of Syria and Aleppo Governorate. And one of the reasons the ceasefire came about was because of that. Because the Syrian Army, the Syrian government was actually advancing and winning. And that is one of the reasons why the US even negotiated,\u201d he said. Moscow negotiated the ceasefire with the full support of Syria and Iran, the expert said. The Syrian government has authorized Moscow to speak on its behalf. Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian negotiation team were in constant contact with Damascus and the Syrian government. Russia also thought it was in the best interests of Syria as a state and of Syria as a society that this peace agreement be brokered. However the US saw an opportunity in this truce and it has never been sincere, he explained.\n\u201cIt is important to point out not only that the truce is based on the victories of Russia, Syria and Iran and their regional allies in fighting in Syria but the Syrian position on the US is also very important: they welcomed the US-Russia deal but at the same time they are always wary of the US. Since the US does not keep its promises,\u201d the expert said.\nThere is only one side that really has humanitarian concerns, he added.\n\u201cWhen you look at it from a logical angle, Syria and its allies including Russia were fighting and defeating the terrorists. They were advancing towards Aleppo and in other areas and they did not need to make the truce at the time,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey made it because they believed it was in the best interests of Syria as a state and Syria as a society. It was in the best interests of the Syrian people to go forward with the truce,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we just see now is that the US is not sticking to its word,\u201d he therefore concluded.\n}}

He said he raised concerns as they would be in hostile territory at a vulnerable time , but the low-ranking officer's objections were in vain.\nAt 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 4, 2012, Lewis and his fellow soldiers set off to to verify a 12-kilometer path of highway and entire village was clear of explosives.\nInside the village, they were checking around buildings and in nearby vegetation when bursts of enemy gunfire rang out.

During that time, help couldn't get to Lewis.\nThe soldier said he stayed on the ground and \"played possum.\" When the threat dissipated, Dillon said he was thrilled to see Lewis sitting and looking back at him, acting as if nothing was wrong.\n\"I was being tough,\" Lewis said at the ceremony, generating a few laughs.\nThe bullet had entered the right side of his ACH, just above the bottom ridge, and left a tiny hole that continued through to the inside of the helmet. A few inches away from the entry hole, the bullet exploded out of the front of the ACH, blowing off square inches of the green-painted surface, exposing the frayed Kevlar below. While it's difficult to say exactly how much the helmet deviated the bullet's path, Dillon believes it saved Lewis' life.\n\"That would be the assumption that I would make, as I look at the helmet, the way it sits, where they were firing at us from. The Kevlar did its job and deflected it from going through just enough to keep him alive,\" Dillon said.\nStaff Sgt.

He said, like, many soldiers, he'd long complained about the weight of gear, but his tune changed that October day during his fourth deployment.\n\"I always tried to short-cut it. But after the fourth of October, my main (message) to young soldiers is to use the gear the way it's supposed to be used.

{{The Army has intensified the training soldiers receive on the FIM-92 Stinger \u2014 a man-portable, air defense missile \u2014 after nearly 15 years of moving away from the weapon system.\nThe Stinger has been around since the late 1970s, according to the Army. As counterinsurgency became the Army\u2019s primary mission focus, however, training drifted away from the shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile.\n\u201cBringing back the Stinger addresses a self-identified gap that the Army created and has recognized,\u201d said Lt.

Aaron Felter, the director of training and doctrine for the Air Defense Integrated Office. \u201cWe\u2019re getting back to the basics and providing short-range air defense to maneuver units.\u201d\nThe shift back to the Stinger is based on the Army chief of staff\u2019s initiative to close the gap in short-range air defense capabilities the United States and its NATO allies suffer from on the European continent, according to the Army.\nThese SHORAD systems will be focused on defending against low-flying aircraft, such as drones and attack helicopters, which present a considerable threat to maneuvering forces, according to a memo by Brig.

{{Army and Notre Dame have at least one thing in common this season: Each has had trouble against option attacks.\nWhen they meet on Saturday in San Antonio at the Alamodome, Army (5-4) just might have a small edge. The Black Knights use the clock-chewing triple option, and the Irish (3-6) are reeling from a one-point loss to Navy, their third setback in four games in what so far is the worst of Brian Kelly\u2019s seven seasons as head coach.\nThe chance to play in a bowl game is still a possibility for both teams. Kelly said he planned no changes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going through a tough spot, but we\u2019re persevering,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s not where anybody wants to be. But we\u2019re handling the situation as best we can and we\u2019re trying to make certain that everything that we do makes us stronger for right now and for the future.\u201d\nThe Black Knights are coming off a 31-12 loss at home to Air Force, whose option was in high gear. Despite a subpar showing against the Falcons \u2014 144 yards on 40 carries \u2014 Army still ranks second nationally in rushing (320.3 yards per game), averaging 5.3 yards per carry.\n\u201cDefensively, another challenge of playing a triple-option team that \u2026 runs the ball very, very well and can be opportunistic throwing the football,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cSo, focus is on, obviously, the details and the execution. In a large degree, we were able to do a lot of those things well last week, but not as well as Navy.\u201d\nNotre Dame\u2019s six losses have come by a combined 29 points (4.8 per game), and all were one-possession games.\n\u201cThat happens,\u201d Army coach Jeff Monken said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had opportunities to win a lot of football games and just haven\u2019t had a break go their way or the other team has made a play. That\u2019s sports.\u201d\nLast week, trailing 28-24 midway through the fourth quarter Kelly opted for a 31-yard field goal instead of gambling on fourth-and-4 deep in Navy territory. He made the call even though his defense had not forced a punt, and Notre Dame never got the ball back, finishing the game with just six possessions.\nNavy ran out the clock with its triple-option offense, converting two huge fourth-down plays on the final drive.\n\u201cWe learned quite a bit the last week. We definitely learned how to value our possession on the offensive side of the ball,\u201d Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer said. \u201cWhen you have the opportunity to take shots, you\u2019ve got to be successful with them because your possessions are limited when you\u2019re playing against a triple-option team.\u201d\nOther things to know when Army plays Notre Dame on Saturday:\nKELLY-HOLTZ CONNECTION\nKelly will tie Lou Holtz for the most losses at Notre Dame with his next defeat. Holtz had a 100-30-2 record in 11 seasons at South Bend. Kelly is 58-29 in seven seasons at Notre Dame and just 14-13 in his last 27 games with the Irish. Charlie Weis is next in losses with a 35-27 record in five seasons.\nSTOUT DEFENSE\nThe Army defense is fifth in the nation in passing yards allowed per game (166.6) and sixth in total defense (286.4). It\u2019s also 13th in the country in scoring defense (18.1 points).\nNAVY HANGOVER\nNotre Dame has often struggled in the week after playing Navy, going 3-6 the past nine seasons. The streak includes losses to Air Force in 2007, Syracuse in 2008 and Tulsa in 2010, narrow victories against Wake Forest in 2011 and Purdue in 2012, losses to Pittsburgh in 2009 and 2013 and Arizona State in 2014. The Irish beat USC 41-31 last season.\nSHAMROCK SERIES\nNotre Dame is 7-0 in Shamrock Series games, which are officially home games played at neutral sites. The series was started in 2009 when the Irish beat Washington State 40-14 in the Alamodome. San Antonio is the first repeat site for the game, and Army is the first repeat opponent. The Irish beat the Black Knights 27-3 at Yankee Stadium in 2010.\nHISTORY LESSON\nIn this storied rivalry, Notre Dame has beaten Army 14 straight times and the last time it lost to Navy and Army in the same season was 1944. That year, the second-ranked Irish lost to No. 6 Navy 32-13 and a week later, after dropping three spots in the AP poll, they lost to top-ranked Army 59-0 in the largest loss in Notre Dame history.\n}}

Reuters determined the picture is in fact a distorted version of a colour image taken in 1996 of refugees who had fled the genocide in Rwanda.\nAnother picture, also printed in black-and-white, shows men aboard a rickety boat. \"Bengalis entered Myanmar via the watercourse,\" the caption reads.\nActually, the original photo depicts Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants leaving Myanmar in 2015, when tens of thousands fled for Thailand and Malaysia. The original has been rotated and blurred so the photo looks granular. It was sourced from Myanmar's own Ministry of Information.\nThe Myawady's publishing arm, in its statement, made no mention of an alterations of images.\nThe prime minister of neighbouring Bangladesh, where about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a Myanmar military crackdown launched after Rohingya insurgent attacks in August last year, denounced the use of the photographs when she was asked in a news conference about them.\n\"What Myanmar has done is simply heinous.

{{The controversial Bayou Bridge Pipeline has been granted a permit by the New Orleans District office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cross southern Louisiana between Nederland, Texas, and St. James Parish, including wetland areas across the Atchafalaya River Basin, the corps announced late Thursday (Dec. 14).\nAnti-pipeline protesters want release of messages between state and companies Pipeline opponents gathered at the Governor's Mansion on Wednesday.\nThe issuance of the permit prompted an immediate response by environmental groups that have led a multi-year campaign against the pipeline because of concerns about its effects on the Atchafalaya basin's wetlands, including the potential for oil spills.\nBayou Bridge Pipeline route map.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. \"We will resist non-violently now. We will put our bodies in the way to prevent this pipeline from being built because this pipeline threatens drinking water, our crawfishermen, and so much that we hold dear.\"\nThe pipeline would deliver light and heavy crude oil to the NuStar Energy LP's terminal in St. James Parish. The first phase of the project, which consists of a 30-inch pipeline from Nederland to Lake Charles, went into service in April 2016, according to the Energy Transfer website. The pipeline is a joint venture between ETP and Phillips 66 Partners, LP, in which Energy Transfer has a 60% ownership interest and serves as the operator of the pipeline.\nBayou Bridge Pipeline permit challenged in new lawsuit St. James Parish residents, environmental groups cite risk of spills, wetland damage\nThe Corps' decision to issue the permit for construction of a 24-inch diameter crude oil pipeline followed completion of an environmental assessment, review of its compliance with Section 408 of the Clean Water Act, which regulates projects that cross other corps water projects, and consideration of comments received during a public notice and comment period.\n\"The Corps neither supports nor opposes this project,\" said Col. Michael Clancy, commander of the New Orleans District. \"Our mission is to apply the best science, engineering and information available to determine if a proposed project complies with all regulations under our authority.\"\nThe federal permit on approval of a coastal use permit from the state Department of Natural Resources, which was granted in April, and a water quality certification from the state Department of Environmental Quality, which was granted on Tuesday.\nThe corps also is requiring the applicant to avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands \"to the greatest extent practicable by reducing the proposed project's footprint and pipeline right of way,\" said a corps news release announcing the decision.\n\"The 162.5-mile pipeline will temporarily impact 455 acres of jurisdictional wetlands and include conversion of 142 acres of forested wetlands to permanent pipeline right-of-way, requiring the purchase of 708 acres of mitigation from Corps-approved wetland mitigation banks located within the watershed of impacts,\" the news release said. \"The combination of avoidance, minimization and mitigation will result in zero net loss of jurisdictional wetlands.\"\nThe mitigation requirements require the pipeline to buy mitigation credits from 11 separate privately-owned mitigation banks along its routes, which will use the money to restore a variety of wetland types equivalent to wetlands being damaged by the pipeline. That includes freshwater wetlands, cypress and tupelo swamps and other types of natural resource restoration.\nConstruction must also comply with provisions aimed at protecting nesting periods for a variety of species of colonial wading birds and other birds, including halting construction during nesting periods. Birds required to be protected include anhinga, cormorant, great blue heron, great egret and snowy egret, all of which have different nesting periods.\nBuilders of the pipeline also will have to to survey the route for the presence of both active and inactive eagle nests. \"If a bald eagle nest is discovered within 660 feet of the project area, then an evaluation must be performed to determine whether the project is likely to disturb nesting bald eagles, with the evaluation to be posted on a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service bald eagle web site.\nWorkers will also have to take steps to avoid disturbing the habitat of the Louisiana Black Bear, including protecting bald cypress trees of 36 inches or greater at breast height and restrictions on disposal of food and garbage.\nThe project will also be required to use a \"push-pull\" method of installing pipeling through inundated wetlands to reduce damage.\n\"The Corps carefully weighed the energy benefits of the project while ensuring environmental protections remain in place,\" said Martin Mayer, Chief of the New Orleans District Regulatory Branch. \"We will remain vigilant in monitoring the project to ensure that the pipeline remains in compliance with all permit conditions.\"\n}}

{{HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has deployed army medics to work at major public hospitals following a week-long strike by junior doctors who are demanding an increase in call allowances and a duty free car facility, a senior government official said on Wednesday.\nGerald Gwinji, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, said the doctors\u2019 strike had put pressure on public hospitals, which were already struggling with shortages of drugs and under-funding from the government.\n\u201cWhen some people are not coming to work there is bound to be an impact on service delivery and because these cadres (doctors) on strike are at the first level of care, the impact is even greater,\u201d Gwinji said.\n\u201cIn some instances we have deployed cadres from the uniformed forces to help in reducing the pressure.\u201d\nThe paediatric and maternity sections were the worst affected, Edgar Munatsi, the president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, which called the strike, told Reuters.\nMunatsi said doctors wanted their call allowances to be increased to $10 an hour from the current $1.20. He said more than 400 doctors were staying away from work, warning that senior doctors could also join the strike.\n\u201cSo the doctors are insisting that the government has to offer something on the table on the issue of call allowances and the duty free car facility as promised. Without that, they are not going back,\u201d said Munatsi.\nAt Parirenyatwa Hospital, Zimbabwe\u2019s largest public hospital in Harare, non-critical patients were being turned away and referred to local clinics run by city councils.\nUnited Bulawayo Hospitals in the country\u2019s second city Bulawayo put out a notice saying that due to the doctors\u2019 strike \u201cwe have resolved to attend to \u2018dire\u2019 emergencies only.\u201d\nDoctors in the southern African nation last embarked on a major strike in 2014 demanding higher call allowances, but returned to work after President Robert Mugabe\u2019s government promised to increase them and provide a car facility which would allow doctors to import vehicles and not pay the duty.\nLast July, doctors joined nurses, teachers and other civil servants in a national shutdown over unpaid wages, which coincided with anti-government protests called by social media groups over a deteriorating economy.\n}}

{{Greg Stejskal served as an FBI agent for 31 years and retired as resident agent in charge of the Ann Arbor office.\nBy Greg Stejskal\nticklethewire.com\nThis is a Christmas story, but it really began just before Thanksgiving in 1987, at the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta.\nThe Cuban inmates had rioted and had taken control of a sizeable portion of the penitentiary. The catalyst for the riots happened years before that in 1980.\nThe Mariel boatlift, a massive exodus of Cuban refugees from Cuba to the US, had among its refugees, convicted criminals. Fidel Castro had apparently thought the boatlift was an opportune time to decrease his prison over-crowding.\nUpon arrival in the US those Cubans who were determined to be criminals were detained and placed in US penitentiaries with no clear plan as to what to do with them in the long term.\nThis uncertain future led predictably to unrest and ultimately to the prison riots.\nWhen the inmates rioted and took control of part of the Atlanta Penitentiary, they also took some of the staff hostage.\nThe FBI was tasked with negotiating with the inmates and providing SWAT teams should it become necessary to retake control of the penitentiary by force and rescue the hostages.\nSWAT teams from many of the large offices were called to respond to Atlanta. Our Detroit team was one of those teams.\nSo on a cold, rainy November night, an Air Force C-141, flying a circuit, landed at Detroit Metro Airport to pick up our team. Already on board were teams from Pittsburgh and Cleveland. We arrived in Atlanta early the next morning.\nThe Atlanta Penitentiary is a foreboding place. It was built in phases beginning in the late 1800s, into the first few decades of the 1900s.\nIt has 60-foot walls with watch towers on each corner. Upon our arrival we climbed to the top of one of the watch towers and looked down into the prison yard. It looked like a scene from a post-apocalyptic \u201cMad Max\u201d movie.\nInmates were walking around the yard, all carrying homemade weapons: long-knives, swords, etc., made from scrap metal and sharpened on some of the prison machine tools.\nAfter seeing that scene, we all assumed we were going to be in Atlanta for awhile. We knew we would prevail if it came to having to use force. After all they had made the critical tactical mistake of bringing knives to a gun fight. But they had hostages and a large supply of non-perishable food in their control.\nThe next morning I was walking to the Penitentiary administration building for the shift change briefing when I saw a tent where free coffee and Krispy Kreme donuts were being served. It was the Salvation Army tent. The Salvation Army was there every day of the insurrection including Thanksgiving serving coffee, donuts, smiles and kind words. I\u2019ve been on a lot of SWAT operations, but I had never been offered coffee, donuts or kind words from the neighborhood in which we were operating.\nKnowing the Salvation Army was there for us, had me thinking that I owed this selfless organization a debt \u2013 a pay it forward kind of thing.\nThe penitentiary insurrection was resolved peacefully after about two weeks. The key factor was that no social order was developed among the inmates just anarchy. They went through several months food supply in days. (There are a lot of good stories from the \u201csiege\u201d of the Atlanta Penitentiary, but those can be told another time.) We all went back to our respective homes.\nI didn\u2019t forget the Salvation Army\u2019s generosity. I decided every holiday season for a few hours, I would volunteer to ring the bell and tend the red kettle in my hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nSome years later, I was ringing the bell at a local super market with my wife. We had both donned our Santa hats and were wearing the Salvation Army issue red vests. It was snowing lightly, the Christmas lights were shining and Christmas carols were playing on the stores PA system.\nWe were at one door of the store greeting shoppers and collecting donations in our kettle, when all of a sudden there was a commotion at the other door.\nA man ran out of the store. He was closely followed by two other men in white butcher smocks. The men in the smocks tackled the man in the parking lot. They were trying to hold him down, but he was struggling & screaming as they pulled several cuts of meat from under his coat. The erstwhile meat thief continued to yell, flail and kick.\nI turned to my wife and said, \u201cI should probably go help them.\u201d I kept flex-cuffs (large heavy duty zip-ties) in my car. I grabbed some flex-cuffs, walked over and knelt next to the struggling man.\nHe was facing away from me. In my \u201csoothing,\u201d authoritative voice, that I used for arrests and reading someone their rights, I told him, we could let him up, but he needed to let me put these cuffs on him.\nThe man turned his head to look at me, and his eyes got very big.\nI\u2019m about 6\u20194\u201d and weighed about 235 lbs. I had forgotten I was wearing a Santa hat and a big red vest. After staring at me for a few moments, he asked, \u201cwho are you?\u201d I smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019m Santa\u2019s helper.\u201d\nHe immediately stopped fighting and struggling. He submissively allowed me to place the cuffs on him. The butchers and I stood him up, and he placidly waited for the police to arrive.\nI have often thought there might be some profound Dickens type message to be derived from this incident. I don\u2019t know if the meat thief was stealing prime rib for his family, sort of a protein version of Jean Valjean, or maybe he was planning to host a barbecue at a homeless enclave.\nThere is certainly some irony in collecting donations for the Salvation Army at one door of a grocery store, and at the same time, to have an economically disadvantaged meat thief fleeing from the other door.\nMaybe the message is as simple as, if you\u2019re poor and hungry at Christmas time, there are places other than your local grocery store you can go that care, like the Salvation Army.\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays!\n}}

Observing his worsening symptoms, he called an on-post pulmonologist, but as a new patient, was reportedly told he would have to wait at least a month just for an appointment.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Something isn\u2019t right. I need to be looked at. Somebody needs to take me seriously. Somebody needs to help me,\u2019\u201d he told Fox 46. \u201cAnd I just kept getting told, \u2018Sir, new patients are not a priority.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the terminal cancer diagnosis one month later, Stayskal made contact with attorney Natalie Khawam of the Whistleblower Law Firm, who agreed to represent the special operations soldier and pursue a \u201c$10 million lawsuit against the government alleging medical malpractice,\u201d the Fox 46 report said.\nLeskosky, who was hired by the Whistleblower Law Firm to review the CT scans performed by the Army, was astonished that Army doctors missed blatant indicators, allowing the tumor to spread aggressively without treatment.\n\u201cIt was completely obvious,\" Leskosky told Fox 46. \"I can\u2019t fathom how any experienced radiologist missed this case. ... If I were testifying in court, I would call it a case of gross malpractice.\u201d\nAsked how an earlier detection of the tumor could have changed present circumstances, Khawam replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a man who\u2019s dying.\u201d\nLEGAL OBSTACLES\nDespite the egregious nature of alleged malpractice, Stayskal\u2019s case is unlikely to ever go to trial.\nThe 1950 Supreme Court decision known as the \u201cFeres Doctrine\u201d prevents active duty military personnel from suing the government for injuries sustained as a result of military service. Conversely, civilians are well within their rights to sue for cases of medical malpractice.\nMany, however, argue that the government\u2019s application of the Feres Doctrine, a move primarily designed to prevent personnel from suing for war-related injuries, is excessively broad.\n\u201cSoldiers signed up to fight for our country, fight for our freedom,\u201d Khawam told Fox 46. \u201cThey didn\u2019t sign up to be malpracticed on.\u201d\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, R-Concord, is among those who think the Feres Doctrine is unfairly applied. After hearing Stayskal\u2019s story, Hudson drafted legislation with the intent to change the parameters of the Feres Doctrine to allow service members the right to sue the government under specific circumstances.\n\u201cMy internal sense of fairness tells me there ought to be some limited pathway for folks like Rich who can pursue this,\u201d Hudson told Fox 46. \"He\u2019s a real American hero who put his life on the line for his country and to see what he\u2019s going through now is tough.\u201d\nWhen reached, Department of Defense officials would not comment on Stayskal\u2019s case.\n\u201cReversal of the Feres Doctrine would destroy the premise of the no-fault compensation system currently applicable to all workers' compensation programs, including military compensation programs,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Carla Gleason told Fox 46.\nKhawam, meanwhile, insists the case for Stayskal, who nearly gave up his life for his country without objection, has nothing to do with workers' comp, a sentiment echoed by Hudson.\n\u201cIt violates a sense of right and wrong,\u201d he said.\n\u2018IF IT\u2019S FALSE HOPE, IT\u2019S STILL HOPE\u2019\nAmid the whirlwind of legal procedures and medical treatment plans, Stayskal remains steadfast in trying to be the best husband and father he can be \u2014 for as long as he can.\n\u201cI try to set examples for my kids of, you gotta do the right thing, you gotta fix the things that are broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, who else is going to do it?\u201d\nWhile trying to prepare his wife and children for a future that doesn\u2019t include him, Stayskal simultaneously goes about his days trying to maintain a positive outlook, often ignoring that the cancer even exists.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s false hope, it\u2019s still hope,\" he said. \"But there\u2019s days I just really try not to believe that I have it. And, some days, I\u2019m good at convincing myself.\u201d\nNo matter how thorough the convincing, however, questions of one\u2019s own mortality are bound to creep in, a factor the Purple Heart recipient who cheated death in Ramadi those many years ago confronts often.\n\u201cSometimes you just stare at the things you never stared at before,\u201d he said. \u201cWondering how many more times you\u2019ll get to see them.\n}}

{{(intro to my Who blogging, please read before commenting \/ previous: Episode 11: \u201cFear Her\u201d)\nRussell Davies, you magnificent bastard. I told myself I wasn\u2019t gonna cry. I\u2019ve seen these episodes a bunch of times now, I should be over the crying. But I cry every time. Every damn time I cry.\nMaybe it\u2019s only those of us who don\u2019t consider Rose our stand-in who think it\u2019s overly dramatic for her to tell us she \u201cdied.\u201d She\u2019s still alive, right? Cut off from the Doctor \u2014 forever \u2014 but she\u2019s still walking around. But: death? Sure, that\u2019s why I\u2019m always a mess by the time the Doctor burns up a sun to say good-bye to Rose. Partly because, you know, no one\u2019s ever burned up a sun for me. But mostly because it\u2019s easy to imagine how empty life would feel after the Doctor. What could ever possibily measure up to being with him? Wouldn\u2019t you feel like an empty husk walking around on autopilot? I mean, I was depressed after coming back from a trip to Paris, for pete\u2019s sake. Coming down from life with the Doctor\u2019s gotta be worse by, you know, astronomical orders of magnitude.\nExcept\u2026 \u201cHow long you gonna stay with me?\u201d the Doctor asked Rose. \u201cForever,\u201d she replies. Except we know \u2014 we know \u2014 he would have dumped her eventually like he dumped Sarah Jane. Oh, he would have made some excuse, lied to himself, even, to justify the dumping, to make it into something other than him dumping her (like he did with Sarah Jane). But he would have done it. Because he\u2019s selfish, in some ways. He\u2019ll give his all to save a whole planet, but he\u2019s afraid to deal with one person for too long. He can\u2019t even tell Rose he loves her when it\u2019s the last thing he\u2019ll ever say to her. After all the extremes he goes to in order to say good-bye to her \u2014 burning up a sun and all \u2014 he can\u2019t say it. Even when he thinks she\u2019s saying she\u2019s pregnant \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that she mentions \u201cthe baby\u201d the way that she does in order to make him believe that she\u2019s the one who\u2019s pregnant, and she\u2019d only say it that way, and he\u2019d only respond in the way he does, if, you know, they were getting up to things that could result in a baby \u2014 and he\u2019s apparently not at all freaked out by the idea\u2026 he can\u2019t say it.\nHe\u2019s kind of a self-centered bastard, is what I\u2019m saying, I guess. Not that I can love him any less for it.\nI mean, look: Even Jackie can\u2019t help but fall under his spell. (The Doctor disgustedly wiping Jackie\u2019s kisses away has got to be one of the funniest moments of the show, ever.) She\u2019s terrified of him taking her daughter away forever, pushing her into transforming into something her own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize, but she cannot help but find herself intrigued not only by the big weird sphere but by the Doctor\u2019s inability to stop himself from figuring out just what the hell it is. He\u2019s just impossibly magnetic, and you can\u2019t help but get dragged into whatever mess he\u2019s currently in.\nI\u2019d like to think, maybe, that by the end of these two episodes, Jackie has reconsidered what she says to Rose: \u201cIn forty years time, fifty, there\u2019ll be this woman, this strange woman walking through the marketplace on some planet a billion miles from Earth, but she\u2019s not Rose Tyler, not anymore. She\u2019s not even human.\u201d And not just because Rose has been \u201csaved\u201d from that terrible fate. Everyone changes. Rose will be a different person in fifty years anyway, even if she never sees the Doctor again, even if she never leaves Earth again. She would have been a different person even if she\u2019d never met the Doctor.\nOr maybe Jackie will never understand that. She\u2019s got another bit of dialog in these episodes that is, I think, kind of a dividing line between, in the small scale, people like us who get the Doctor, and in the much larger scale, people who get science fiction. The Doctor\u2019s trying to explain to Jackie that the ghosts aren\u2019t \u201cghosts,\u201d and she\u2019s upset to hear this. \u201cYou\u2019re always doing this, reducing it to science,\u201d she says, exasperated, to him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be real?\u201d As if explaining something scientifically makes it less \u201creal.\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s why I cry at the end of this story.

{{What makes a good leader? For the purposes of a recent Rand Corp. study, in cooperation with the Army\u2019s headquarters personnel office, researchers measured sergeant major and first sergeant success.\nWhat they found is that the Army might not be promoting the right kinds of soldiers into leadership roles.\n\u201cThe Value of Experience in the Enlisted Force,\" released on Oct. 8, analyzed data from more than 200,000 soldiers who enlisted between 2002 to 2014 and compared their rates of attrition, promotion and demotion to the times in service of their sergeants major or first sergeants.\nThey concluded that while experienced NCOs have better success in these aspects with their junior soldiers, at a certain point, their long careers can start to work against them. And that while soldiers who promote quickly are valued by the Army as overachievers, their lack of experience might hinder their leadership abilities.\n\u201cFor example, attrition rates are higher among junior personnel under senior personnel who have less than 22 years of service,\u201d according to the report. \" However, more experience is not always a positive factor; rates are also slightly higher under senior personnel with more than 25 years of service.\"\nIt was a similar story with time spent deployed, often seen as the hallmark of a seasoned leader. Between 20 and 39 months deployed was the sweet spot, with higher rates of attrition among senior NCOs with more or less time overseas.\n\u201cOur results are consistent across our measures of senior leader experience: In each case, junior personnel have higher attrition under senior personnel with low levels of experience,\u201d according to the report. \"But higher levels of experience are not always associated with lower levels of junior personnel attrition. Junior attrition is higher in units with the most-experienced leaders than in those with moderately experienced leaders.\nTo deepen the study, researchers consulted a handful of previously published works about leadership both within and outside of the military, then sat down with active duty soldiers of various ranks and career fields to talk about their personal experiences with leadership.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

That 2 percent difference would translate to two more soldiers who finish their first enlistments, saving the Army the roughly $60,000 it drops into recruiting and training new soldiers.\n\u201cThis suggests that the Army would need to recruit about one fewer soldier for each unit with a leader of typical experience than for one with a less experienced leader,\u201d according to the report.\nEven when controlled for the increased pay of a senior NCO who\u2019s been in more than 22 years versus less than 22 years, keeping those two soldiers is a cost savings.\nThis table from Rand Corp's \"The Value of Experience in the Enlisted Force\" compares success of junior soldiers to the experience levels of their senior leaders. (Rand Corporation)\nTo evaluate other nuances of leadership experience, the Rand researchers turned to a 1996 Cornell University report called \u201cResearch on Leadership Selection and Training: One View of the Future.\u201d\nThat report found that inexperienced leaders were better in low-stress situations, while those with the most experience better handled stressful conditions.\n\u201cThe proposed explanation for these results is that leaders under stress rely on their intuition; when based on a greater range of experience, this intuition and hence their performance is better,\u201d according to Rand. \u201cUnder low-stress conditions, the more experienced leaders are not as challenged and tend to cut corners and, as a result, underperform.\u201d\nFinding and growing leaders\nAdmittedly, according to the study, the Rand team didn\u2019t include mid-grade NCOs in their study, but rather extrapolated that team leaders, squad leaders and platoon sergeants would fall in line with the command climate set by their superiors.\nOverall, the study\u2019s key finding was that senior leaders with less than 22 years of experience were more likely to have soldiers who left the Army early, with lower promotion rates and higher demotion rates.\n\u201cIn particular, attrition is higher in units with leaders who were fast promoters and thus have less experience,\u201d according to the report.\nBut of course, the Army cannot restrict all company first sergeants and battalion command sergeants major billets to NCOs who fall between the 22- and 26-year mark, so the researchers honed in on fast-burners, to analyze what factors might contribute to their more negative statistics of junior soldier performance.\n\u201cJunior enlisted personnel are less likely to be promoted quickly to E-5 when the senior enlisted leader has more deployment experience,\u201d the report found, regardless of time in service. \u201cWhile we do not know the exact mechanism behind this finding, it is possible that senior leaders with more deployment experience apply promotion criteria in a stricter manner or in a manner that rewards somewhat different traits.\u201d\nThey also found slower promotion rates in senior leaders with middling Armed Forces Qualification Test scores \u2015 between 50 and 64 \u2015 or if the leader him or herself took a while to make E-6.\nThese nuances of the enlisted promotion system might account for more than the performance of junior soldiers, researchers found. They might also explain why young, high-performing soldiers burn up the ranks but \u2015 statistically, at least \u2015 don\u2019t make the best senior leaders.\nA soldier\u2019s first few promotions come automatically. When they\u2019re ready to hit E-5, they have to complete schooling and have their documented accomplishments evaluated by a board.\n\u201cThe promotion point process captures largely the knowledge theme when referring to the leadership qualities identified in our interviews,\u201d according to the report. \u201cDeployment experience, civilian education, awards, and weapon qualification might serve as proxies for effective leadership, but they are indirect.\u201d\nAlong with PT scores, those factors add up as promotion points that will give a soldier the edge.\n\u201cArmy doctrine and interviews with junior enlisted personnel identify multiple competencies and attributes associated with effective leadership, none of which is explicitly captured in the promotion process until promotion to E-7,\u201d the Rand team said of their interviews with 19 active duty soldiers as part of the study. \u201cThese observations suggest that the Army is not identifying soldiers with leadership potential early in their careers and fostering them accordingly.\u201d\nJunior soldiers are generally evaluated on their MOS proficiency, but not so much on their potential to become senior leaders, despite the fact that those roles are their inevitable career trajectory if they stay in the Army.\nNot until a soldier is up for E-7, when they are interviewed by a board and have to articulate their leadership experience and philosophy, does the Army begin to really hone in on those skills.\n\u201cNone of the factors considered in the promotion point process explicitly captures whether the NCO cares for his or her soldiers or is successful at mentoring and training them,\u201d the report said. \u201cNotably, a full 40 percent of promotion points to E-5 are associated with physical fitness and weapons qualification.\u201d\nWhile the Army hasn\u2019t made changes to the points system recently, it did update the way E-5 and E-6 promotion boards are run in 2017, automatically sending eligible specialists and sergeants to their local promotion boards. Previously, they would have needed a battalion commander\u2019s recommendation to appear, which to some gave off the appearance of favoritism and unfairly penalized soldiers who weren\u2019t as well known or liked by their leadership.\nFalling behind in this way sometimes discouraged soldiers from staying in the Army, feeling their promotion chances weren\u2019t good because they weren\u2019t as popular with their chain of command.\nSoldiers in the first Army Central Basic Leader Course plot points on their maps before hitting the land navigation range at Camp Buehring, Kuwait. The Army is poised to introduce an all-new Basic Leader Course as part of a larger education overall for enlisted soldiers. (Sgt. Youtoy Martin\/Army)\nMaking changes\nGenerally, according to data, soldiers who promote quickly to E-5 will continue to promote quickly throughout the rest of their careers, if they stay in. If they promote quickly again, to E-6, their retention rates are high. However, those who promote most quickly to E-5 are the least likely to stay in the Army long term.\nThe result is a narrow pool of early high-performers moving into higher and higher leadership positions, with little indication that they have leadership potential. On the other hand, those who are slower to promote to E-5 are more likely to stick around for another enlistment and beyond.\n\u201cThus, from the perspective of managing attrition, retaining soldiers who promote in the median range makes the most sense,\u201d according to the report. \"Of course, it may be possible to provide additional training or experience to the fastest-promoting soldiers prior to putting them in charge of units.\u201d\nA key recommendation of the Rand report is that the Army figure out how to measure a soldier\u2019s compassion or ability to foster a learning environment when considering him or her for sergeant or staff sergeant, to indicate whether a good performer on the fast track will have success later on.\n\u201cThe Army should not only be considering soldiers\u2019 historical demonstration of leadership in the promotion process but also be considering the potential for leadership, as it does for senior NCO positions,\u201d the report said.\nQuantitative personality tests could help capture some predictors, the study suggested. For example, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test has two profiles that show clear leadership affinity, the \u201ccommander\u201d and the \u201cexecutive.\u201d\n\u201cThese soldiers may be identified as part of an informal process of mentoring in the NCO support channels, but, doctrinally, the Army\u2019s process is not oriented to identify those soldiers as a matter of course,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAs a result, the Army may be losing effective leaders early and limiting the pool of senior NCOs.\u201d\nAnother idea, the researchers offered, could be wrapping some of the elements of the NCO Evaluation Report into promotion consideration for more junior soldiers, rather then relying entirely on promotion points. Another is a promotion exam, which could identify knowledgeable and proficient soldiers early on.\nWhile the Rand study was underway, the Army revamped its professional military education system for enlisted soldiers, doing away with the online Structured Self-Development program and replacing it with a more interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style Distributed Leader Course.\nFrom specialists to sergeants major, the Army is overhauling its education system From professional military education to the transition back to civilian life, the Army is trying to grow better leaders and give soldiers tools to translate their knowledge into civilian education.\nSo few senior leaders have taken those courses so far, according to the report, that it would be difficult to measure whether the updated program had any effect on leadership skills. However, because only the Basic Leader Course \u2015 required for promotion to E-5 \u2015 had touched on leadership skills, and only minimally, researchers felt DLC was not likely to make a big change.\n}}

I got picked and they didn't get picked,\" Angus said.\nPart of the selection process included Angus sending a video of himself and describing what he's like.\nWere his friends upset that they didn't make the cut while he did? \"Kind of, but they're my friends and they're excited I got on it,\" Angus said.\nAngus' new friends on Hunter Mountain are Jeffrey Brewer \"J. Brew\" of Manchester, New Hampshire; Alessandra Camerlingo, Blairstown, New Jersey; Jillian Metz, Manalapan, New Jersey; Alex Shinder \"Sheen,\" Hoboken, New Jersey; Taylar Shinn, Oroville, California; Marc Vinda, Bergenfield, New Jersey; and Carissa Witham, Waterbury, Connecticut.\nThe creative and production team for \"Winter Break\" was also behind the \"Jersey Shore\" reality shows that introduced us to Snooki and company, and \"MTV Floribama Shore\" which followed eight young adults who live together during the summer on the Gulf Coast at Panama City Beach. That show had eight episodes with titles such as \"Drunken Words; Sober Thoughts\" and \"Eat, Pray, Party.\"\nIn \"Winter Break,\" according to MTV, \"the party moves from the beach to the mountains.\"\nA jovial 30-second trailer suggests high jinks on Hunter Mountain including diving into the snow wearing swimming trunks, a broom on a bare rear, drinks, tears (\"We can't be friends anymore\"), exhortations (\"Feel any better, you little boy?\"), and cabin fever (\"We've only been here five days!\").\n\"Winter Break\" was filmed over the course of a month about a year ago, Angus said. He wasn't at liberty during a recent prearranged telephone interview via MTV to discuss some aspects of the show such as whether any romance breaks out in the cabin. \"You're probably going to have to watch the show to see that,\" he said.\nStill, the time on Hunter Mountain \"was a great experience,\" he said. \"A lot of snowboarding. We had a lot of fun.\" Hunter Mountain itself is \"a very nice mountain ... good snow for the East Coast. We call it the 'Ice Coast.' \"\nAngus graduated from Wachusett Regional High School in Holden and served on active duty in the U.S. Army with postings that included South Korea and Fort Riley in Kansas. He now works in construction and moved a couple of months ago from Rutland to the Chicago suburb of Homer Glen, Illinois.\nHe said he'll be watching the premiere of \"Winter Break\" there, while his parents view the show in Rutland. \"Me and a lot of my friends are gonna watch it together.\"\nAngus has stayed in touch with his friends from Hunter Mountain. \"We all talk all the time. We're all pretty good friends,\" he said.\n\"MTV Floribama Shore\" ranked as MTV's highest-rated new series debut in over three years and the series has been renewed for a 20-episode second season.\nAsked if he would consider doing a reality TV show again, Angus said, \"If an opportunity came up and I was asked about it and liked it, I would definitely do more.\"\nMeanwhile, he has some advice for everyone back home. \"Stay tuned to the show coming up. It's going to be a lot of fun,\" Angus said.\nContact Richard Duckett at richard.duckett@telegram.com.

{{This isn't your dad's M16 rifle Textron Systems has created a new kind of cartridge and weapons to lighten the load and reduce recoil on machine guns and rifles. Military Times ground combat reporter Todd South breaks it down.\nThe replacement for the Army\u2019s 5.56mm Squad Automatic Weapon could be an entirely new type of light machine gun that fires not only a different caliber round, but caseless ammunition.\nThat\u2019s because one of the five companies recently awarded contracts to produce a weapon prototype by this time next year has been building weapons to fire that type of ammo for the past 14 years.\nA notice posted Thursday included the identities of the five companies:\nAAI Corporation Textron Systems in Hunt Valley, Maryland.\nFN America LLC.in Columbia, South Carolina.\nGeneral Dynamics-OTS Inc.\nPCP Tactical, LLC. in Vero Beach, Florida.\nSig Sauer Inc. in Newington, New Hampshire.\nThe companies were awarded a contract to provide a prototype for the Army\u2019s Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle, or NGSAR. The light machine gun is the first planned major overhaul of small arms in decades.\nBased on the notice, it appears that FN America has been granted an award to provide two prototypes, while the other four companies will provide a single prototype.\nThose prototypes will help the Army decide what\u2019s possible given their extensive requirements for the new weapon. There will then be an open competition following those submissions, where more companies can try to get in on the weapon that will utlimately replace the M249 SAW and influence the M4 replacement, as well.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to our Newsletter: Sign up for the Army Times Daily News Roundup\nIt is also the first weapon of its type that could mean a dramatic shift in all small arms, with follow-on changes planned for an individual carbine that will likely incorporate the machine gun changes, officials have said.\nCurrent efforts include work on a lighter machine gun that fires a government-designed 6.8mm round, which falls between the lighter 5.56mm and heavier 7.62mm used in heavy machine guns. But submissions can include other calibers, so long as they meet accuracy and lethality requirements for the new weapon, officials have said.\nIn the Textron release, the company says the prototype will be based on their cased-telescoped weapons and ammunition portfolio. The company has designed both a carbine and light machine gun variant, which have been displayed publicly in recent years.\nThe NGSAR will be an \u201cintermediate caliber, high-velocity, magazine-fed system,\u201d according to the release. It will weigh less than 12 pounds with ammunition that weighs 20 percent less than the traditional brass case ammo.\nThe weapon will be at most 35 inches long and be able to fire 60 rounds per minute for 15 minutes without a barrel change.\nAccuracy matters too. A shooter must be able to hit standard targets at 50 meters while standing, with three- to five-round bursts at least 70 percent of the time.\nThe companies also received awards for advanced weapons and fire control technologies, for the Next Generation Squad Weapons Technologies, the umbrella program for advancing small arms, and for the fire control capability.\nWayne Prender, vice president of Applied Technologies & Advanced Programs at Textron Systems, told Army Times Thursday that he couldn\u2019t discuss details of their fire control submissions configuration. But he did talk about some of the capabilites they plan to provide.\n\u201cWe\u2019re offering up a solution set, day\/night system optics with a laser range finder, integrated ballistic computer for computation of the target,\u201d Prender said.\nLast year Textron unveiled a 6.5mm carbine using their ammunition. The NSGW program aims to use an intermediate caliber, likely in the 6mm range, such as their 6.8mm ammunition development.\nBut Prender said he couldn\u2019t discuss details of the caliber submission for the weapon prototype.\n}}

{{WASHINGTON (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Army has posted a solicitation for biodegradable ammunition to be used during training exercises.\nIn the solicitation, the Army notes the branch manufactures and consumes hundreds of thousands of rounds for training events that may require 100 years or more to biodegrade.\nBy replacing existing ammunition with biodegradable alternatives, the Army says it can reduce potential environmental hazards. The long-term effects of current training rounds can include pollution and corrosion of soil and nearby water.\nTo remedy the situation, the Army is seeking biodegradable alternatives for low-velocity 40mm grenades, various mortar shells, shoulder-launched munitions, 120mm tank rounds and 155mm artillery rounds.\n\u201cThe biodegradable materials identified can be utilized by private industry to manufacture biodegradable water bottles, plastic containers, or any other composite or plastic product(s) on the market today,\u201d the Army said in the solicitation.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has bioengineered seeds to withhold germination for several months until the new materials naturally degrade. The seeds can also consume contaminants as they grow.\nOnce a contract is awarded, the work will be divided into three phases. During the first phase, the contractor will develop a process to produce biodegradable composites with remediation seeds for 40mm and 120mm training rounds. In the second phase, the contractor will manufacture prototypes and perform ballistic tests. For the third and final phase, the contractor will collaborate with PEO Ammunition and other contractors to establish a transition path.\nContractors have until Feb. 8 to submit proposals.\nCopyright 2016 United Press International, Inc.

{{Army aviators recently ran helicopters through missions with a kind of robot co-pilot for the first time, using technology a company says will be demonstrated in coming months on Black Hawk helicopters.\nThe pilots directed an \u201coptionally piloted helicopter\u201d through mission scenarios ranging from obstacle avoidance to contour flight, according to a release.\nThe pilots used the technology to move a modified commercial helicopter, the S-76B Sikorsky, known as Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft or SARA, through the scenarios designed under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program with Lockheed Martin.\nThe V-280 tilt-rotor aircraft could change the way air assault troops operate Bell's V-280 Valor tilt-rotor aircraft should be a welcome addition to units conducting fast rope insertions, rappelling, or any other air assault operation.\nThe automated capabilities are part of the Army\u2019s larger Future Vertical Lift program, which aims to revolutionize how helicopters are employed by the services.\n\u201cFuture vertical lift aircraft will require robust autonomous and optimally piloted systems to complete missions and improve safety,\u201d said Chris Van Buiten, vice president of Sikorsky Innovations.\nWhile personnel with the company have been developing and testing the technology for some time and flown more than 300 hours of autonomous flight, the Oct. 29 event at Fort Eustis, Virginia, was the first time non-company pilots operated the aircraft.\n\"These aviators experienced the same technology that we are installing and testing on a Black Hawk that will take its first flight over the next several months,\u201d Buiten said.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

This technology will ultimately decrease instances of the number one cause of helicopter crashes: Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).\u201d\nDARPA Program Manager Graham Drozeski said that with the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation, or ALIAS, they\u2019re trying to balance human and autonomous contributions through work with the software and pilots.\nLt. Col. Carl Ott, chief of flight test at the Army\u2019s Aviation Development Directorate, echoed that comment, saying that the Army refers to the type of capability being pursued as \u201cmission adaptive autonomy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s there when the pilot needs the aircraft to fly itself, keep it free of obstacles, so the pilot can focus on more of a mission commander-type role, but the pilot\u2019s also able to interact with system to re-suggest or re-route or re-plan on the fly,\u201d Ott said.\nBeing able to do that seamlessly without shutting down the system are key capabilities for complex flight.\nA soldier exits a Black Hawk helicopter during a demonstration by the 6th Ranger Training Battalion at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.

{{Ryan Tucker, left, with his fellow missionaries.\nU ntil three years ago, Aubert L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance had no idea who Mormons were or what they believed. All he knew was that he liked messing with them. ntil three years ago, Aubert L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance had no idea who Mormons were or what they believed. All he knew was that he liked messing with them. To be fair, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, then 15, was clueless about most religions. The preppy-chic Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had never been to church, grew up agnostic verging on atheist and assumed \u201cMormon\u201d was just another name for the Amish when he first stumbled on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints online. He\u2019d been browsing his favorite timewaster -- the Art of Trolling, a website less holy, more holy shit. And there, between funny snapshots of misspelled signs, he discovered a new religion and an addictive pastime: pranking the missionaries manning the official \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d homepage. Hoping to attract converts, the church invites people to come online and message anonymously with missionaries who can answer \u201cwhatever questions you may have about any Christian topic.\u201d L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, like thousands of other Internet trolls, abused it spectacularly, logging on with a fake persona and bombarding the Mormons for hours with nonsense questions. But then, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s hoaxing gave way to something that surprised even him: a genuine curiosity in a group he says he\u2019d assumed was \u201cjust some sort of tribe\u201d living in \u201creally remote parts of the universe.\u201d Less than a year after first fooling around with Mormon missionaries, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance was baptized. Ryan Tucker, a missionary who helped convert him in the church\u2019s chatroom, hailed it as a journey \u201cfrom troll to testimony.\u201d \"Those chats were so amazing,\" says L'Esp\u00e9rance. \"Before I even knew much about the church, I really felt its power immediately.\" The teenager\u2019s unlikely route to baptism helps explain why the white-haired patriarchs of the Mormon church stunned their followers last summer by lifting a ban barring missionaries from social media. During a worldwide broadcast in June, the church leaders heralded a new era of redemption through screens. All 84,000 of the church\u2019s missionaries would eventually be able to proselytize over the web using a previously forbidden arsenal of media, including blogs, email, text messages, Skype and even Facebook. Along with their in-person preaching, missionaries can now use social networks to check in on potential converts, or woo new ones with status updates about the Heavenly Father. \u201cThe principles missionaries have always been taught actually just work better online,\u201d says Gideon Burton, a professor at Brigham Young University who has advised the church on its Internet missionary work. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot more efficient.\u201d For Mormons, this about-face on social media was a radical change, as startling as if the church had dropped its ban on beer. Until the June announcement, the Internet had been off-limits to missionaries to shield them from \u201cworldly entertainment,\u201d like the Times and Twitter, that could distract them from their religious calling. The missionaries, who can serve from age 18, could go online just once a week, and then only to blog about their faith or email their family. Phone calls home were permitted just twice a year. The same tools recently eschewed as slippery slopes to temptation have now been sanctioned by the church to convey the most sacred of messages and fulfill one of the holiest of Mormon duties. In what marks a new phase in the evolution of one of the fastest-growing religions in the world, which has doubled in size since the 90s, the Mormon church is doing for religion what Amazon did for stuff: embracing the web to make shopping for a new faith easy, convenient and accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Despite its conservative reputation, the church has actually been an early adopter of any tech that might deliver baptisms. Just as it did nearly 200 years ago, when the church pioneered mass-market distribution of its Bibles by printing a half-million texts, and a century ago, when it released a feature film on the Book of Mormon, now it is pinning its hopes on the marketing muscle of a technology with even broader reach: the web. In an age of Internet-enabled instant gratification, the church is betting the demand for instant salvation can\u2019t be far behind. Missionaries at the Referral Center Mission. The shift on social media actually began over five years ago, in 2008, with a quiet experiment at the Referral Center Mission in Provo, Utah. The first online-only mission -- and the official headquarters of \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d -- launched as a call center-type operation set up to answer basic questions about the church and accommodate injured or disabled missionaries who\u2019d have difficulty marching through neighborhoods. Believing that accepting a new faith would be far too profound a revelation for mere chatrooms, the church instructed the inaugural Internet missionary to funnel potential converts to local missions, which could take over offline. Wrong move, they discovered. People like L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance preferred the safety of a screenname to the awkwardness of lectures from two strangers in suits. Even within a church legendary for adding converts with machine-like efficiency, the Internet-only mission has been an outlier. Whereas traditional Mormon missionaries convert, on average, six people during their 18- to 24-month service, the online apostles in Provo have averaged around 30 converts per missionary per year, says Burton. And these people stick around. Ninety-five percent of the Internet converts have kept active, a retention rate more than triple the norm. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of,\u201d says Burton. \u201c[The Referral Center Mission] was equal to the highest-baptizing missions that are out there.\u201d Damning influences be damned: Church leaders realized these so-called \u201cFacebook missionaries\u201d were getting results too impressive to ignore. Tracting, or sending missionaries house to house, has since the 1830s been a pillar of the church\u2019s expansion that helped it grow to over 15 million members. In the past few decades, however, the number of converts has shown a concerning drop, from a peak of 331,000 a year in 1990 to just a little over 272,000 in 2012, according to official church records. Sometime between the car phone and the iPhone 5, people stopped opening their doors to the itinerant pairs of neatly dressed proselytizers. Plunging missionaries into the very epicenter of worldly entertainment looks like the best shot at fixing a problem that otherwise may only grow worse.\nA recent \"Chat With a Mormon\" discussion. \u201cNow, many people are involved in the busyness of their lives. They hurry here and there, and they are often less willing to allow complete strangers to enter their homes, uninvited, to share a message of the restored gospel,\u201d lamented Elder L. Tom Perry, a 91-year-old member of the church\u2019s top leadership body, when he introduced the digital strategy. \u201cTheir main point of contact with others, even with close friends, is often via the Internet. The very nature of missionary work, therefore, must change if the Lord is to accomplish His work.\u201d This e-proselytizing not only marks a change in the machinery of the church, but also suggests a rewiring of our own instincts. As the Mormon church has learned in the course of its experiment, we\u2019d rather discuss life\u2019s most intimate topics through the impersonal anonymity of the screen. \u201c[W]e could knock on their door and they\u2019d never let us in,\u201d says Emilee Cluff, a missionary who served between 2011 and 2012, of her efforts to proselytize. \u201cBut they\u2019d accept our friend request on Facebook all the time.\u201d\nMembers of the Mormon church believe they\u2019ve been blessed with the \u201cgift of tongues,\u201d an uncanny talent for languages that allows them to preach the Gospel anywhere, to anyone. Tucker, a square-jawed 21-year-old from Syracuse, Utah, will tell you he used this gift to be a more effective missionary. Only, in his case, his \u201ctongue\u201d was the language of email, texting and instant messaging. Between June 2011 and July 2013, Tucker served at the Referral Center Mission, joining the ranks of dozens of other college-age men who\u2019ve been tapped for the church\u2019s online-only service. He received little initial training -- \"they just turned the missionaries loose,\u201d says Burton -- and Tucker had to continually improvise a strategy for making himself and his faith seem friendly through the sometimes sterile medium of typed messages.\nTucker at a cubicle at the Referral Center Mission. The youngest of six children in a devout Mormon household, Tucker, who has muscular dystrophy, had been looking forward to his mission for as long as he could remember. And yet when he received his call to serve in Provo, he was devastated. The church\u2019s forays into online evangelism were then still largely unknown beyond the innermost circle of the church elite. From what Tucker could glean, he figured he would be put to work filling orders for copies of the Book of Mormon. But after the mandatory two weeks of missionary training, Tucker realized he\u2019d be counseling more people each day than most missionaries meet in a week, chatting privately online with potential converts as far off as Albania and Ghana for 11 hours a day, six days at a stretch. Tucker would set up Skype- or Facebook-based appointments to tutor prospects in the key principles of his faith. (The church requires these \u201cinvestigators,\u201d as they are known, to be taught four lessons covering such topics as \u201cthe plan of salvation\u201d before they can be baptized.) Most of the time, however, he was juggling two, three or even five chats at a time with anyone who signed on to \u201cChat with a Mormon.\u201d He\u2019d answer questions about polygamy, take abuse from argumentative atheists and tell people about going to church. \u201cAt the end of most days,\u201d he says, \u201cthe number one feeling was exhaustion.\u201d In the lulls between chats, Tucker used his Facebook profile and personal blog to post digital breadcrumbs like Bible verses or church videos that might lead people his way. (\u201cHow did you see the Lord's hand in your life recently? This is a legitimate question -- I want answers!\u201d) The church discourages online tracting -- approaching people at random with messages about the Gospel -- so while Tucker\u2019s friends were trudging through neighborhoods searching for sympathetic ears, the missionaries in Provo just had to sit back and wait for people to come to them. Which they did, in droves. Of the thousand-odd strangers who log on to \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d each day, slightly more than half have a genuine interest in learning more about the religion, according to missionaries who have served in Provo. This leads to more baptizing with less effort: Missionaries can now put their legwork aside and focus on reeling in a self-selected cohort curious enough to reach out directly. What\u2019s more, the Facebook missionaries also get an all-access pass into neighborhoods their traditional counterparts have struggled to touch. \u201cThis kind of reversed the entire arrangement with how missionaries work: Rather than us knocking on peoples' doors, they were knocking on our door,\u201d says Burton. \u201cPeople are much more reachable who would otherwise be out of reach -- people in gated communities, remote areas or areas of the world where the church is not allowed to proselytize. We\u2019ve had converts in Asia and other places where the church is not formally recognized, but where people have found the church online.\u201d \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d asks only for a first name, and the anonymity has emboldened people of all ages to sign on for reasons both spiritual and sacrilegious. Chatters come to find, mock, scold, convert, question and berate the missionaries, as well as to confess sins, air doubts and seek advice. A missionary who served in Provo recalls messaging with people so lonely, they sat through weeks of the missionaries\u2019 lessons, only to return, under a different name, hoping to be taught again \"because it gave them someone who cared about them.\" Even though the pseudonyms attract Bart Simpson-esque trolls, they also bring people who can indulge a vague interest in the church without the headache or embarrassment of inviting gangly teenagers into their living rooms. The online missionaries have also tapped into a hidden constituency: members of the church who experience crises of faith that they\u2019re too ashamed of taking up with their fellow believers. \"I think one of the best things about the chat is the anonymity a person has,\" says Tyson Boardman, the first-ever Internet missionary. \"They're able to be completely open with us about any questions they might have reservations asking a person at church. Because of that, we were able to get down to a lot of people's primary concerns.\" A survey of people converted by the Internet evangelists found that 60 percent \"preferred having online discussions during the conversion process,\" according a 2010 story in LDS Living magazine. One college-age convert used \"Chat with a Mormon\" to ask questions anonymously and ensure her Mormon friends weren\u2019t twisting their answers to tell her what they thought she wanted to hear. Michael Johnston, a 20-year-old from Oklahoma who was baptized in 2010 after chatting with Referral Center missionaries, liked the safety of knowing he could quickly exit the chat any time he got uncomfortable. \u201cOn the Internet, if something were to happen, I could just blame it on an Internet error or say, 'Oh, my computer crashed.' I didn\u2019t necessarily have to fully commit to talking with them,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had Mormon.org, I don\u2019t feel like I would even be a member of the church.\u201d One of Ryan Tucker's Facebook status updates, posted during his mission. From 11 a.m. through 10 p.m., Tucker worked side-by-side with five to 30 other young men in a utilitarian room with the industrial carpeting, low ceilings, fluorescent lights and gray cubicles of a car dealership. (Female missionaries also field chats in Provo, though none serve full-time there.) Tucker and his partner took each chat together as a pair, and would monitor each other\u2019s screens for any illicit tweeting or Poking. Slip-ups do happen, even among the saintly. A \u201csister\u201d who served in a California mission -- one of a handful that tested the combination of traditional tracting and online follow-ups that will soon be standard -- says a few young men were caught using Facebook to flirt with girls they\u2019d met on their neighborhood rounds. It\u2019s known as the \u201cflirt to convert,\u201d and, though the peccadillo pre-dates social media, it\u2019ll get missionaries kicked off their Facebook accounts. Since the online missionaries operate a click away from sin at all times, Tucker and his fellow proselytizers had to put up with extra chaperoning by Referral Center Mission staffers who reviewed each message going in and out of the Provo office. This was \u201ca point of frustration for us because we always felt like we were watched,\u201d says Tucker. He remembers being chastised for sympathizing with a skeptic to whom Tucker had admitted he had personally struggled with the same point of dogma before coming to accept it. \u201cOne of the leaders came back and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to say you\u2019ve questioned a point of doctrine,\u2019\u201d Tucker says. \u201cI personally think it makes us more reliable to say we\u2019re not just uncritically accepting this, and that we are thinking through this.\u201d \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d missionaries don\u2019t stick to a set script, but do quickly steer conversations toward the virtues of their faith. A pair of proselytizers will begin with low-pressure banter -- they introduce themselves, ask the visitor if she has a question -- then try to use her query to initiate a chat about her beliefs. \"My companion is typing up a response,\" a missionary might say. \"But while you wait, why don't you tell me what brought you to Mormon.org?\" As they go, they\u2019ll test chatters\u2019 sincerity and try to weed out the trolls by giving \u201cmicro-commitments,\u201d such as an article to read. If someone can\u2019t be bothered to click the link, the missionaries assume she isn\u2019t serious and politely wrap up the chat. Tucker also obsessively analyzed the snippets of text onscreen for clues about each visitor\u2019s receptivity to the Word. He says with help from his \"gift of tongues,\" he could tell if something was amiss just by a subtle switch in punctuation -- from exclamation marks to ellipses -- or by the length of time it took for a chatted reply. He and other missionaries found smiley face emoticons, paired with references to \u201cpeace,\u201d \u201ccomfort\u201d and \u201cenlightenment,\u201d were good hints their pupils had been moved by the Holy Spirit, meaning they believed the teachings about the Gospel to be true. \u201cIt became fairly easy to recognize people who were less than serious. The hard part was not treating them as such,\u201d says Tucker. \u201cThe second we say, \u2018This person\u2019s a troll,\u2019 is the second that we give up on helping them.\u201d Missionaries at the Referral Center Mission.\nThis person\u2019s a troll, Tucker figured when he first spoke with L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance. It was the fall of 2011 when L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, then 16, logged on to \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d and, by chance, was paired with Tucker in a chatroom. It was eight months after the peak of L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s trolling, and L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance confessed to Tucker that he\u2019d messed around with the missionaries before. Still, he insisted he was back now to learn about their faith. For real. L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s older brother was then recovering from a near-fatal car crash, and L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, who\u2019d replaced pranks with prayers in the wake of the accident, had sworn to no particular god or faith that he would join a church if his brother pulled through. Now he felt he owed it to the missionaries to at least hear them out after all the hours he\u2019d harassed them. Tucker, not entirely convinced, shrugged off L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance with a vague suggestion to read the Book of Mormon. To Tucker\u2019s surprise, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance actually did. The next time the Canadian returned to Mormon.org, the two scheduled a time for L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s first lesson on Skype. Each chat session opened with a prayer, then Tucker and his companion would guide L'Esp\u00e9rance through the tenets of his faith using church websites, online Prezi slideshows and short, church-approved YouTube videos. Tucker might dive into the intricacies of church history or explain the Mormon take on \"the character of God.\" Every part of the conversion process -- save attending church and entering the baptismal waters -- could elapse over instant messaging. L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance saw immediate benefits to confining any and all conversion talk to his computer. For one thing, he didn\u2019t have to involve his parents, agnostics who looked askance at religion. After L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance ordered a copy of the Book of Mormon, he discovered with some dismay that it came with a pair of missionaries who showed up at his doorstep one evening. L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance refused to invite them in, worrying it would disturb his family. So instead, the shivering missionaries spent 30 minutes huddled with L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance on the porch of his house, narrating the life of Joseph Smith Jr. in the chill of the November night. \u201cIf you could possibly imagine the worst circumstances for a missionary lesson, those would be the circumstances,\u201d recalls L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance. Yet on the Internet, Tucker was never an inconvenience. L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance could message the missionary any time he saw Tucker\u2019s screenname pop up on Skype and the two would have daily, informal chats, even between their official lessons, undisturbed by disapproving parents, intrusive siblings or the need for formality. Missionaries in turn see such talks as a chance to forge stronger bonds with their acolytes and prove Mormons aren't \u201crobots\u201d -- a concern expressed by more than a few missionaries. \u201cWe understood our job was to teach him, yeah, but also to be his friend and help him,\u201d says Tucker.\nA Prezi presentation Tucker shared with potential converts online. With missionaries in the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand now helping man the \"Chat with a Mormon\" service, anyone can instantly reach a missionary whenever the urge strikes, and in a two-dimensional format many already know and love. The church can even take advantage of people's \"rabbit hole\" indulgence online -- a tendency to get lost in an endless progression of sites and Google searches that crop up when someone explores a random topic that catches their fancy. Liza Morong, for example, went online one evening after seeing the irreverent \"Book of Mormon\" musical. The 21-year-old visited Mormon.org, purely to \"see just how insane they were,\" she wrote later. She impulsively signed on to \u201cChat with a Mormon\u201d to \"destroy everything those missionaries were 'told' to believe,\" but ended up sending a Facebook friend request to the missionary she talked to, then casually messaging about his faith. Three months later, Morong was baptized. Even after L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance received his parents\u2019 blessing to invite the two missionaries into their home, he still saved the more delicate topics about the Mormon church for Skype. He especially welcomed the privacy of the screen when it came to one of the church\u2019s most challenging commandments, and one nearest to the hearts of 16-year-old boys: the law of chastity, which forbids masturbation, sex before marriage and same-sex intercourse. \u201cTo be very blunt: You don\u2019t really want to discuss things like masturbation with people you don\u2019t know, in person,\u201d says L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit hard looking someone in the eyes and telling them you have problems living the commandments with regard to chastity. And in another regard, it\u2019s a little bit tough talking about those things out loud when your family is around.\u201d \u201cIt was easier online because you don't need to actually speak certain things,\u201d L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance adds. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an impersonal thing when you're online.\u201d More impersonal, but more honest. The two missionaries who\u2019d been teaching L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance offline were the first to learn that he\u2019d decided to convert. But L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance turned to Tucker for help with the full-on crisis that followed L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s baptism that December. \u201cOverwhelmed with horrible feelings\u201d about his decision to convert, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance debated expunging his name from church records just moments after taking his vow. He rushed home, where he says he \u201ccried my life out,\u201d masturbated and refused to speak to anyone. \"I felt like I needed to reject everything that I\u2019d received,\" he says. In an earlier age, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance might never have addressed his doubts and slowly faded away from the church, like the 70 percent of all converts who fail to stay active after their baptisms. Instead, L'Esp\u00e9rance logged on to Skype to share his breakdown with Tucker, who said he was sorry and told L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance to pray. The new convert followed Tucker\u2019s advice. He says he later felt \u201can overwhelming sense of peace\u201d about his decision. Today, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance\u2019s entire Facebook persona seems to have become a tribute to his faith. The church actively encourages its members to engage in their own, informal Internet missionary work by using social media to talk about their beliefs to their friends. \"Your fingers have been trained to text and tweet to accelerate and advance the work of the Lord -- not just to communicate quickly with your friends,\u201d David A. Bednar, a member of the church's second-highest governing body, said in 2011. \u201cThe skills and aptitude evident among many young people today are a preparation to contribute to the work of salvation.\u201d On Facebook, a beaming photo of L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance -- Book of Mormon in hand -- sits over a string of posts about \u201cGod\u2019s power\u201d and \u201cbrethren in testimony.\u201d His online nickname is \u201cAubertBelieves.\u201d And this spring, L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance will be fulfilling his God-given responsibility to spread the Word as he sets out on his own mission.\nL'Esp\u00e9rance's Facebook profile photo.\n}}

{{An immigrant arrested after delivering pizza to an Army base, and later ordered released, has been arrested again. Greg Cergol reports.\nThe Ecuadorean immigrant who was held for deportation after he delivered pizza to a Brooklyn Army installation, before a judge ordered his immediate release last July, has been arrested after allegedly assaulting his wife and keeping her from calling police.\nPablo Villavicencio, whose arrest became a national cause and a flashpoint for the immigration debate, was taken into custody early Monday on a fourth-degree misdemeanor and was still in a Nassau County detention center as of mid-morning, sources said.\nAccording to court documents, Villavicencio allegedly pushed his wife against a wall and slapped her body after an argument, and then purportedly took her phone so she could not call for help. (The criminal mischief charge relates to the alleged taking of the phone, interfering with her ability to call police.)\nHis lawyers did not immediately have a statement on his arrest. ICE officials said Villavicencio will not be taken into custody while he has pending immigration applications.\nVillavicencio was arrested on June 1 while making a delivery to the garrison in Fort Hamilton. When he arrived at Fort Hamilton, guards requested identification, and he produced a city identification card. A background check showed he had been ordered to leave the United States in 2010 but stayed.\nBut he walked out of an immigration detention center in New Jersey last July and was greeted with hugs from his jubilant wife and two young daughters.\nHours earlier, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty wrote of Villavicencio, \"Although he stayed in the United States unlawfully and is currently subject to a final order of removal, he has otherwise been a model citizen.\"\nThe judge said Villavicencio could remain in the United States while he exhausted his right to try to gain legal status. Villavicencio applied to stay in the U.S. after he married a U.S. citizen, with whom he has two young girls, ages 2 and 4.\nThe judge cited those children and said they are U.S. citizens.\n\"He has no criminal history,\" the judge wrote. \"He has paid his taxes. And he has worked diligently to provide for his family.\"\nThe judge ruled after putting a government lawyer on the spot over the effort by immigration authorities to enforce a 2010 deportation order. He questioned the need to detain and quickly deport the 35-year-old Villavicencio.\n\"Well, the powerful are doing what they want, and the poor are suffering what they must,\" the judge said after hearing Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Cordaro defend the government's actions.\n\"I mean, is there any concept of justice here or are we just doing this because we want to?\" the judge asked. \"Why do we want to enforce the order? It makes no difference in terms of the larger issues facing the country.\"\nThe case attracted widespread attention amid a crackdown by the administration of President Donald Trump on illegal immigration. Trump, a Republican, has said his policies are designed to keep the country safe.\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said at the time that the federal government had \"cruelly\" kept Villavicencio from his wife, Sandra Chica, and two daughters \"for no legitimate reason.\"\nCopyright Associated Press \/ NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth\n}}

{{While Colombia defeated Greece in Saturday's first World Cup match, there was another international soccer game brewing \u2013 but this one wasn't being televised to the world.\nInstead, people from New Columbia \u2013 a mixed income community in North Portland that is made up of families from more than 22 countries \u2013 happily huddled beside the fences around Bless Field, the area's new public pitch for kids. Operation Pitch Invasion, a local charity that builds, revitalizes and maintains soccer fields, hosted the new pitch's dedication and opening Saturday morning.\nThe organization has been fundraising for the $200,000 project over the last year. It was built entirely off donations.\n\"I never thought we'd be here,\" said Shawn Levy, the director of OPI. \"I learned really quickly that there's people behind us.\"\nThe Timbers' Chief Operations Officer Mike Golub announced the team's \"official partnership\" with OPI at the opening ceremony. The team, which helped fund Bless Field, plans to continue to work with OPI to develop more children's fields, or facilities, throughout the Portland area. Levy said the plan is to have one field completed every two years.\n\"We have a vision for OPI that covers this entire community,\" Levy said. \"From Woodburn to Hillsboro to Gresham to Clark County \u2013 that's our neighborhood. And we would like to think that we can have a Bless Field, or something like a Bless Field, in all points of the Portland compass.\"\nFor kids like Michael Underwood, 13, having more fields could make a huge difference. Underwood wants to go pro and Bless Field is a block away from his New Columbia home. He plans to be on it every day.\nBefore Operation Pitch Invasion started construction, the lot Bless Field now fills was still a destination for soccer \u2013 just not a very good one. It was all dirt.\n\"There were too many rocks everywhere,\" Underwood said. \"On this field, I don't slip.\"\nBless Field, named after Timbers Army founder Howie Bless, is made of turf, a synthetic grass most often used to outfit sports arenas. Home Forward, which serves about 15,000 low-income residents in the county \u2013 including those in New Columbia \u2013 donated the lot to Operation Pitch Invasion.\nThe 107 Independent Supporters' Trust, or \"170ist,\" \u2013 the Timbers Army's nonprofit organization \u2013 made the largest donation for the field at $50,000. The Portland Development Commission donated $40,000, and organizations including the Timbers, Providence Health and Services and Adidas helped make up the rest.\nGinean McIntosh has been able to watch the field's construction from her kitchen window. She said the whole community has been eager and excited for it to open.\nMcIntosh's 7-year-old daughter, Jasmine, has been playing soccer for the last two years. Jasmine spent Saturday morning chasing after the ball with about 30 other neighborhood kids. New Columbia is home to more than 1,200 children from across the world, according to Operation Pitch Invasion officials.\nDifferent languages filled the field, but the love for the game was universal.\n\"The thing with any sport is, you don't come out with your differences, you come out together with a common goal,\" McIntosh said. She added the new field and the game itself is a way for her daughter to connect and meet with children from other cultures.\nAC Portland will host summer soccer camps on the new field, which is across the street from a Boys and Girls Club. Nearby Rosa Parks Elementary School, which will have year-round schooling, will use the field for physical education classes.\nFor Jasmine, the best part of Saturday's opening was when she got to snag the ball from her competitors.\nBefore putting down her apple juice to return to the ongoing game, Jasmine smiled big.\n\"It's just really cool,\" she said, looking out into the field packed with kids wearing different types of jerseys.\n-- Sara DiNatale\n}}

{{Months after a News4 I-Team investigation uncovered late payments and nationwide backlogs in a federal government daycare program for Army families, government administrators told a U.S. House panel Wednesday they\u2019ve since fixed most of the problems. Scott MacFarlane reports. (Published Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2016)\nMonths after a News4 I-Team investigation uncovered late payments and nationwide backlogs in a federal government daycare program for Army families, government administrators told a U.S. House panel Wednesday they\u2019ve since fixed most of the problems.\nThe troubled program is the Army Fee Assistance Program, administered by the U.S. General Services Administration. The program provides subsidy payments to U.S. Army families that cannot find daycare on military posts and must instead use private providers. An I-Team investigation in July showed the program was suffering a backlog of over 11,000 unanswered phone messages and emails and 9,000 unpaid invoices. Those unpaid invoices forced Army families to spend thousands of dollars out of pocket, with little or no indication of when they would get reimbursed by the feds.\nA GSA financial administrator told the U.S. House Oversight Committee the agency has since reduced the backlog. The agency hired a private contractor to administer the program beginning in February, to avoid future problems and late payments. The same contractor had operated the Army Fee Assistance program in prior years, before the General Services Administration assumed control of it.\nThe agency\u2019s internal watchdog released a report this week saying almost all of the backlogged invoices, voice mails and emails had been dealt with. The Inspector General of the GSA reported approximately 250 unanswered emails and 1,200 unpaid invoices remaining.\nOne of the Army parents affected, U.S. Army Capt. Karmon Dyches of Frederick County, attended Wednesday\u2019s congressional panel. Dyches told the I-Team in July she was suffering financial hardships because of late payments from the feds. She said the government has since processed her checks.\n\u201cAs an Army family, you kind of tend to suck it up, and that\u2019s what we were trying to do,\u201d Dyches said.\nCongressman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said GSA has made tremendous progress since Congress first addressed the problems in September.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways things get done in Congress \u2013 slow and never -- and this is one of those that actually has exceeded my expectation,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cIt makes a difference in family members\u2019 lives, so we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re committed to making sure that the red tape here doesn\u2019t affect their ability to serve the country.\u201d\nThe Army will soon bring in a private contractor to take over running the daycare program. The contractor, Child Care Aware of America, had previously run the program from 2004 to 2014, before the GSA took over. Dyches said she is looking forward to the new era.\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to be back in [Child Care Aware\u2019s] very capable hands,\u201d she said.\nThe shift to the new contractor will be gradual. Families in the D.C. area will be shifted first, but those in other parts of the country will have to wait.\nCarol Ochoa, GSA Inspector General, said the transition will be monitored carefully in order to make sure there is no further disruption to Army families.\n\u201cThese folks are doing all that they can for this country,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cThey\u2019re out there making sacrifices every day. They deserve to be doing that with peace of mind about what\u2019s happening financially with their family at home.\u201d\nApproximately 10,000 US Army families will be transitioned from government administrators to the private contractor, Child Care Aware, by October, administrators said. The transition will shift almost 1,200 families each month, beginning with parents in the Washington, D.C., region.\n}}

{{RAWALPINDI: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor assured that the army will fulfill its election duties in a \u201cnon-political and impartial manner.\u201d\n\u201cThe armed forces are not directly involved in conducting the election,\u201d the DG ISPR said as he addressed a press conference in Rawalpindi to allay concerns regarding the July 25 general election.\nThe military spokesperson clarified, \u201cThe armed forces will only support the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the tasks they have sought our help with.\u201d\n\u201cI am constantly asked whether elections will be held or not but Pakistan is headed towards the general election and this is the third election which will ensure the democratic process,\u201d Major General Ghafoor said.\nStating that \u201c3,71,000 personnel will be deployed on election day with two soldiers inside each polling station and two outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the first time that troops will be deployed to overlook the election process.\u201d\n\u201cThe armed forces have rendered services during previous elections as well,\u201d Maj Gen Ghafoor upheld, adding that a total of 20,831 polling stations have been declared sensitive.\nRegarding overlooking the process of the printing of ballot papers, he maintained, \u201cWe only have to transport the ballot papers in a secure manner and will not be involved in anything else.\n\u201cWe will not take over the printing material, the ECP staff will handle that,\u201d the DG ISPR clarified.\nHowever, he assured that troops will remain deployed at printing presses to ensure no ballot papers are printed after.\n\u201cIn Rawalpindi we have established an army election support centre, headed by a three-star general, to coordinate and if needed communicate with the ECP,\u201d Maj Gen Ghafoor said.\nHe further revealed that the ECP has issued a code of conduct for the military.\n\u201cWe are bound to implement the code of conduct issued by the ECP when executing our duties,\u201d the DG ISPR said. \u201cOur top priority is to maintain peace and security in the country.\n\u201cWe will carry out our duties in a non-political and impartial manner without any interference in the election process,\u201d he maintained.\nFurther, the DG ISPR shared that the ECP has made a system through which pictures will be taken and transmitted to returning officers to ensure that when the votes are counted they are neither less nor more.\nMaj Gen Ghafoor also requested the media to not question the troops deployed at polling stations. \u201cI\u2019d like to request media persons to refrain from approaching troops deployed at the stations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe do not have any political party or alignment and are working only for the country,\u201d he said.\nThe DG ISPR also urged the nation to come out and vote. \u201cNo matter who you support, come out and vote for them,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes for the voting turnout to increase.\nResponding to a query regarding allegations that although polling may be transparent there are measures being taken to ensure it\u2019s not a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d the DG ISPR said, \u201cHas there ever been an election in which at least one political party hasn\u2019t alleged rigging?\u201d\nRegarding candidates being \u2018forced\u2019 to switch parties, the military spokesperson questioned, \u201cHas there ever been an election in which candidates haven\u2019t jumped ship?\u201d\nClaiming that the environment in which 2013 general election was held was more difficult, DG ISPR said, \u201cThere was a different environment then and terrorists threatened to not allow politicians to campaign.\u201d\nAnswering a question regarding the alleged role of ISI\u2019s Major General Faiz Hamid in matters outside his domain, the army spokesperson dismissed the impression, stating that Maj Gen Hamid has played an important role in combating terrorism and his detractors do not understand the scope of his post.\nFurther, the DG ISPR said, \u201cNeither me nor our field commanders give their opinions on a daily basis but talk shows are held everyday from 7:00pm onwards where people share their opinions and say whatever they wish.\u201d\n\u201c106 million Pakistanis

further urged, \u201cEvery single person should go out and vote for a candidate of their choice without any fear.\u201d\nMajor General Ghafoor further clarified that the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) had no role in the incident in Multan wherein an election hopeful was beaten up.\nWith regards to reports that the \u2018jeep\u2019 electoral symbol signifies association with the army, he quipped, \u201cThe jeep is not even the army jeep.\u201d\n\u201cElectoral symbols are neither issued by the armed forces nor the ISI,\u201d the DG ISPR upheld.\n\u201cPlease stop looking at everything with suspicion,\u201d he asserted.\nWith regards to a question regarding the involvement of banned outfits in the polls, he said, \u201cThe ECP has a process of registering political parties and anyone who has objections can approach the electoral body.\u201d\nSpeaking about social media misuse which he had addressed at length during his last press conference, DG ISPR said, \u201cWe do not want to control social media.\u201d\nResponding to a question regarding \u201cextraterrestrial beings\u201d, Major General Ghafoor said, \u201cWe are not political.\u201d\nIn response to a question that whether the army will accept Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan as prime minister, Major General Ghafoor said, \u201cWhoever the people of Pakistan elect whether it be Mr A,B or Z, will

Court-established fund for the construction of dams in the country, Major General Ghafoor said, \u201cThe army chief will donate a month\u2019s pay whereas other general officers will contribute two

{{Although Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, is ostensibly leading the third round in the strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the U.S. in Washington this week, the brains behind the high-level engagement between the two countries is Gen. Ashfaq Kayani.\nFor President Obama and his military commanders, the Pakistani army chief holds the key to gradually extricating American troops from Afghanistan. Obama has reportedly offered a multiyear military cooperation pact and several billion dollars in economic assistance to Pakistan\u2014on the face of it, a very generous quid pro quo.\nSome may wonder why Obama is offering so much to this general who, like Pervez Musharraf, is little-known and much lionized in the American press. Kayani's army and intelligence services are widely believed to support militant groups that are targeting American soldiers. Why would the president chose to bolster an army that is indirectly hurting American interests? It's a legitimate question from those critical of Obama and wary of the Pakistani army's double-dealing. But most commentators tend to overlook the fundamentals that were instrumental in initiating the strategic dialogue between Washington and Islamabad.\nIf the Obama administration does offer a long-term military cooperation pact to Pakistan, the move will reflect a paradigm shift within the U.S. administration. Considerable credit would go to Kayani, who enjoys an unusually cordial relationship with the U.S. military high command, especially Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Without Kayani, the strategic dialogue would probably not have come about. So what exactly is he angling for? A few quotes taken from his public pronouncements give a clear indication of his loyalties and concerns:\nThe general is very clear about the limitations of his own army. But he has made it plain that he does not want coalition forces operating in Pakistan.\n* \"Partnership doesn't mean you say and we act. It is a bond based on considerations of mutual interests. We cannot compromise or undermine our interests by agreeing to your demands.\"\n* \"We will never allow the U.S. and NATO to cross the red lines on the Western border.\"\n* \"The Coalition must trust us. That will give U.S. space to operate in our own areas with determination and lesser criticism from those who want U.S. all to fail.\"\n* \"Pakistan's challenge lies in reconciling its long-term interests with the short-term objectives of the Coalition forces.\"\n* \"Afghanistan will remain fragile until at least 70 percent of security is handled by the Afghans themselves.\"\n* \"We cannot wish for Afghanistan what we don't want for Pakistan.\"\n* \"India remains our concern and its Pakistan-specific strike capability shapes our frame of reference.\"\n* \"The Pakistani army has to be India-centric because Indian defense doctrine is Pakistan-centric.\"\nOne may disagree with one or more of these statements, but they leave little doubt that Kayani, who served as the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI, before becoming the army chief, means business. For him, mutual trust is fundamental to any level of cooperation.\nThe general, who at 59 is a patient and cool listener, is very clear about the limitations of his own army. But he has made it plain that he does not want Coalition forces operating in Pakistan. The recent 10-day border closure to the NATO cargo carriers in retaliation for an attack on Pakistani posts on Sept. 30 reaffirmed that the Pakistani army will not take in such incursions unchallenged.\nThe border closure triggered a deep crisis within the U.S. administration, as Pakistan remains the most important conduit for NATO's vital food and fuel supplies in Afghanistan\u2014almost two-thirds passes through Pakistan.\nKayani doesn't mince words when it comes to India. He tells anyone who will listen that India's troop deployments in Kashmir and the Punjab, and its growing military capacities, will hardly discourage his army from directing its manpower and resources at India.\nAlthough some in Washington expect that recent revelations, leaked through the Indian media, that ISI officers were involved in the November 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai might spell trouble for the Pakistani delegation during the talks, those familiar with Kayani don't foresee a hiccup. U.S. authorities have gone out of their way to underscore that while elements of the ISI may have been implicated in the attacks, there is no indication that the government of Pakistan was aware of them or that it played a hand in their planning or execution. (The timing of the latest revelations is hardly incidental: In August, hours before the Indian foreign minister's visit to Pakistan, the home secretary in New Delhi made similar statements, scuttling the talks in Islamabad the next day).\nIf Obama skips Pakistan when he visits India next month, it will certainly not go down well with the Pakistanis. (President Bill Clinton spent less than five hours in Islamabad after spending five days in India in March 2000, and the slight still rankles.)\nSuch a snub from Obama will only further damage the bruised egos of Pakistanis. It would feed into the narrative that al Qaeda and its Pakistani auxiliaries love to promote\u2014that the Americans cozy up to Hindus and Jews and disdain Muslims. So Obama should visit the country and not avoid it on security pretexts. The U.S. needs Pakistan's help to make a smooth exit from Afghanistan. The longer its troops stay in the region, the more Pakistan will be destabilized. With any luck, that is the message that will come through this week.\nImtiaz Gul heads the Centre for Research and Security Studies, Islamabad, and is the author of The Most Dangerous Place: Pakistan's Lawless Frontier, a book on the militarization of the tribal areas.\n}}

{{It's springtime and a young man's fancy turns, yet again, toward thoughts of war with Iran.\nBut the normally reticent boss of the Israel Defense Forces has just poured cold water on this eventuality. Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israeli newspaper Haaretz in an interview marking that nation's independence day that he doubts Iran is currently seeking a nuclear weapon or that they will eventually decide to pursue one.\nTo be sure, he insists that a theoretical nuclear weapon in the hands of Iran would be disastrous to Israel and its regional standing, and said he was preparing a credible military option, which he says is crucial for Israel's security.\nBut he appears to talk the threat of war down from the boiling point, contradicting the rhetoric of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nGantz, who has considerable sway over national policy, proposes that Iran's nuclear program, which the Islamic Republic insists is for peaceful purposes only, is designed to improve the nation's know-how and materials to the point where it could theoretically build a bomb, if it so chooses.\nIran \"is going step-by-step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb. It hasn't yet decided whether to go the extra mile,\" he said.\nWill they?\nHe suggests that won't happen soon, particularly since in his estimation Iran's program remains vulnerable to external attack.\"The program is too vulnerable, in Iran's view,\" he told Haaretz. \"If the supreme religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wants, he will advance it to the acquisition of a nuclear bomb, but the decision must first be taken. It will happen if Khamenei judges that he is invulnerable to a response. I believe he would be making an enormous mistake, and I don't think he will want to go the extra mile. I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people. But I agree that such a capability, in the hands of Islamic fundamentalists who at particular moments could make different calculations, is dangerous.\"\nTo summarize: Gantz is very worried, the mere possession of an Iranian \"break out\" capacity is alarming to Israel, and a ruling elite could some day rise in Iran that wouldn't act as rationally as he judges the current leadership core to be. But with an Israeli attack certain to close all diplomatic roads, and with a lack of certainty that such a move would succeed, it appears it wouldn't be wise for Israel to attack any time soon.\nReading the tea leaves, Gantz does not seem as enthusiastic for war as Mr. Netanyahu. \"His language is far from the dramatic rhetoric of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and is usually free of the Holocaust comparisons of which Israeli politicians are so fond,\" writes Amos Harel, in his writeup of Gantz's comments.\nHis view of the Iranian regime as \"rational\" echoes comments by Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey this March, in which he likewise described the Iran as a \"rational actor,\" which drew howls of complaint from some American hawks. Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich, for instance, said, \"I can't imagine why [Dempsey] would say that,\" framing Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a \"dictator who said he wants to eliminate Israel from the face of the earth.\"\nThis statement is frequently attributed to Ahmadinejad in the West, but scholars say it stems from a mistranslation and exaggeration of the president's words.\nGantz also told Haaretz that Israel faces a new array of military threats, as a consequence of regional upheaval:\n\"I don't know what will happen in Syria, but presumably the Golan Heights won't be as quiet as before. I cannot remove Syria from the military equation, nor Lebanon. I assume that if there are terror threats from the Golan or Lebanon I'll have to take action. I cannot do everything by 'stand-off' [remote]. The enemy's fire capabilities have developed at every distance, four or five times what they were in the Second Lebanon War and four or five times compared to the Gaza Strip before Operation Cast Lead, not to mention the new ground-to-air missile in Syria.\"\nI personally have long been skeptical that Israel will attack Iran unilaterally, mostly because it would be a risky operation at great distance, against an array of widely dispersed targets, that could possibly lead to missile barrages on the home front from the likes of Hezbollah. Others, many with far more military and regional expertise than I, have worried that an attack is more likely, particularly judging by the alarmist rhetoric of Netanyahu and some of those around him.\nGantz's comments are the latest indications that senior Israeli military officers, who wield great sway over national policy, are not as sanguine about war as Netanyahu is. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-Israeli political analyst and author of \"The Nuclear Sphynx of Tehran,\" a biography of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, writes on Twitter that the general's statement that he doubts Iran will seek the bomb \"clearly contradicts and undermines\" Netanyahu.\nStill, some predictors of war soldier on. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in late 2010 that there was a 50 percent chance that Israel would attack Iran by July of 2011. This March, Mr. Goldberg allowed that perhaps all the tough talk from Israel (tough talk he's transmitted as fact, relying on unidentified sources) was a form of posturing by Netanyahu's government. Then a few weeks he ago, he upped the DEFCON level again, suggesting June 2012 is a \"possible\" time when Israel will unilaterally attack Iran.\nNot, it seems, if Benny Gantz has any say in the matter.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

This is my family.\u2019\u201d\nMcLachlan, 42, decided to roll the dice and see where he ended up.\n\u201cYou could have me being a lawn jockey, holding a lantern outside of a general\u2019s house,\u201d he added. \u201cAs long as I get to wear the uniform and be around the military, I\u2019m happy as hell.\u201d\nFor his service and actions on and off duty since that fateful decision, McLachlan is Army Times\u2019 2018 Soldier of the Year.\nAfter graduating from college, McLachlan spent most of his 20s working with children at a psychiatric facility and bouncing at Knoxville, Tennessee, nightclubs. But as his 30th birthday loomed, he was looking for a change.\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Fear no longer. Be the first to hear about breaking news, as it happens.

I\u2019d always wondered who I truly would be when the bullets were flying, you know, in the middle of an actual war, combat zone \u2014 an actual fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I be a coward, or would I stand and fight? You can war-game that all day long, but until you\u2019re actually in that situation, you\u2019re never going to know. And I wanted to know.\u201d\nHe enlisted in 2004 and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan with 3rd Battalion, 509th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division out of Fort Richardson, Alaska.\nBut a permanent injury sidelined his paratrooper career. He was serving as a senior drill sergeant at Fort Benning, Georgia, when he learned he\u2019d be getting a new job: 25S.\n\u201cThe Army\u2019s got satellites?\u201d he recalls wondering aloud.\nMcLachlan found himself reinvented, as a satellite communication systems operator-maintainer with 1st Space Brigade at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. There, he made a big impression on his unit.\nSgt. 1st Class Wolfgang McLachlan decided to stay in the Army even after he was hurt in an airborne operation. (Courtesy photo)\n\u201cHe sacrifices an inordinate amount of his personal time in grooming soldiers one on one for promotion, boards, and preparation for competitive opportunities such as Best Warrior, Sergeant Audie Murphy, and the Norwegian Foot March,\u201d 1st Sgt. Carolyne Wilding wrote in his Soldier of the Year nomination.\nMcLachlan translated his background as a youth counselor into his approach as a noncommissioned officer, volunteering to take care of his soldiers in unconventional ways.\n\u201cWhat are we doing in the lives of our soldiers?\u201d he said. \u201cEvery Friday we do a safety brief. Don\u2019t drink and drive, don\u2019t do stupid shit. If you feel depressed, call these numbers, talk to these people.\u201d\nBut he wanted to provide even more basic support, especially for soldiers who are new to the unit or adjusting to the Army without spouses or children. So he started inviting them over for a monthly potluck.\n\u201cAll of us just sit down, talk. Rank is not an issue when you\u2019re at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for people to feel like they belong not just to an organization, but a family. Some of these folks, it\u2019s the only family they got.\u201d\nSgt. 1st Class Wolfgang McLachlan, left, is shown here while on deployment to Afghanistan in 2009. (Courtesy photo)\nMcLachlan also stepped up as a command sexual harassment\/assault response coordinator and victim advocate.\n\u201cYour best [Alcoholics Anonymous} counselors are people who have been through it themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cSame thing for sexual and physical abuse, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\nHis volunteer work also includes answering the hotline for the Kill2 Vet Suicide Prevention program, the Downhome Colorado Homeless Shelter and the National Junior Honor Society, according to his former first sergeant.\n\u201cHis behaviors and actions are admirable and represent the best of what the Army has to offer,\u201d Wilding wrote.\n\u2018If not me, who?\u2019\nThough McLachlan has searched out opportunities to help before and throughout his career, two life-or-death situations dropped right into his path last year \u2015 within a week of each other.\nIt was late August, and McLachlan\u2019s unit was preparing for an annual climb of Pike\u2019s Peak. Driving down Highway 130, he happened upon a three-car crash, and one of the vehicles had a severely injured driver with his son sitting in the back.\nMcLachlan grabbed the medic\u2019s bag he always kept in his truck, out of habit since serving an adviser to an Afghan army kandak, or battalion, years earlier.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really have that trained of medics, and I\u2019m their mentor, so guess who\u2019s going to be working on them?\u201d he said.\nMcLachlan worked on the driver until paramedics were able to take him away, and he survived.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the reason I\u2019m glad I did what I did is because that kid has his dad growing up,\u201d he said.\nFive days later, he responded to a car that had driven off the road. The two young men inside had been using drugs, he said, and the passenger was in bad shape.\nHis efforts couldn\u2019t save the boy\u2019s life, he added, but he knew he\u2019d done what he could.\n\u201cThe credit goes to NCOs that I\u2019ve had,\u201d he said. \u201cTo great mentors who have put me into stressful sitations where you don\u2019t really think about what you\u2019re doing \u2013 the training takes over.\u201d\nLooking back, he said, he knew he couldn\u2019t have just driven by and continued on his way to work.\n}}

{{Despite being raised in a city that stands about 300 feet above sea level, Spc.

Justin Duff, Li\u2019s former senior NCO at the engineer battalion, made observations that comes with experience dealing with new soldiers.\nHe said that sometimes medics can simply learn all that is taught at their initial job training and stop there. But great medics push themselves to learn more, do more and advance their skills beyond the school level.\nLi does that, he said.\nAlso, Li came in at a higher rank because he has a college degree. Sometimes, he said, the soldiers who do that struggle in the rank initially. Not so with Li.\n}}

{{The Army has finally selected a company to provide it with the next generation of ultra light-weight, general-purpose camouflage.\nThe Army\u2019s Ultra-Light Camouflage Netting System, or ULCANS, will be an all-weather, state-of-the-art signature concealment system that provides multi-spectral protection for troops and equipment.\nThe program aims to replace the legacy woodland and desert camouflage variants developed in the 1990s, and will be developed in light and dark woodland, snow and alpine, desert, and urban variants.\nThe Army hopes ULCANS will better conceal the signatures of troops and equipment from high-end sensor threats on the battlefield.\nThe contract to produce the next-generation camouflage was awarded to Fibrotex USA Inc., according to a company statement provided to Army Times. The contract is a 10-year, indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity award, with a total value of $480 million.\nFibrotex is expected to begin full-rate production in early 2019, according to the company.\nULCANS will be manufactured in a new state-of-the-art vertical manufacturing facility in McCreary County, Kentucky. (Fibrotex USA)\nULCANS is the result of nearly two years of testing, trials and data collection conducted by the U.S. Army\u2019s Natick Soldier Systems Center in Massachusetts.

{{The stakes are high for car makers trying to keep up with the demands of future buyers.\nIt's not enough to have a pulse on the market now: Businesses need to become more expert at anticipating what consumers will buy years from now, says Sheryl Connelly, in-house futurist for Ford Motor Co.\n\"I think any company needs a futurist \u2014 particularly if you're into automobiles, because it takes three to five years to take an idea and actually execute it to where you have a product to sell,\" said Connelly, who discussed ideas from Ford's 2016 Trends Book at the Connected Intelligence Foundation at Chicago tech hub 1871 last week.\nShe looks at the global microtrends shaping work and lifestyles to adjust for buyer behavior. Here are a handful of trends she sees today.\n\u2022 The Swiss Army Life trend reflects buyers seeking durable products with multiple functions.\n\"This trend tells us they want less, and they expect that less to do more, and serve their needs for a much longer period of time,\" she said.\nAn illustration is the U.S. housing market, which from 1950 to 2005 saw a doubling of square footage for the average home, even as family size decreased, Connelly said.\nBut millennials are going smaller, preferring to spend money on experiences rather than large dwellings.\n\"One third of them would tell you they would seriously consider living in a tiny house,\" she said. \"They're drawn in by the aspect of not having any mounting debt. They like the idea of not being tied down.\"\n\u2022 Mindfulness is going mainstream, she said, with folks realizing health benefits of focus.\n\"More employers are waking up to the notion that mindfulness can improve your productivity, your accuracy in the workplace,\" Connelly said.\nBut disconnecting is hard, as workers perceive that the way to get ahead in their careers is to be a first responder in communications on the job.\n\"That's how they show dedication,\" Connelly said. \"But experts in productivity are saying you need to shut down your phone for certain lengths of time. They say every eight minutes an office worker is distracted. It takes about 23 minutes for them to return to where they were before that distraction.\"\nMindfulness is appearing at odd places, she said, including prisons and airports that have rooms for meditation, yoga and prayer.\n\u2022 The Awe of Aging trend has people redefining what the retirement years look like, Connelly said, as people reach older ages and seniors move to improve their quality of life.\nMany current car features, such as lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control, will play into autonomous vehicles but were designed for an aging population, Connelly said.\n\"Those actually are the building blocks to get us to an autonomous future,\" she said. \"While most people think we're building autonomous vehicles for the young people that aren't interested in cars, it's actually a much better business case to build autonomous vehicles for an aging population. What if they live to be 105 or 125?\n\"We know that with aging comes reduced response times, impaired vision and limited range of motion,\" she said, and car designers account for that.\n\u2022 Waste Not, Want Not takes the green trend to another level, Connelly said, with consumers looking for products made from recycled items.\nFord, she said, uses fabric remnants from clothing manufacturers to insulate doors and back carpeting in its cars and has experimented with using discarded tomato skins from Heinz ketchup plants to make plastics.\n\u2022 The Retail Revolution shows consumers willing to pay more for experiences, she said.\n\"We have people who are buying online, and there's a direct correlation: The more sterile the interaction, the more sensitive to price people are,\" she said. \"If you're not getting a rich experience, then people are feeling very honed in on price.\n\"This is why you're willing to pay more for your Starbucks than you are McDonald's. People don't mind paying more money if you deliver a better experience,\" she said. \"Sometimes it's done through really great customer engagement; sometimes it's the story or legacy of the product; or sometimes it's just extraordinary service.\"\nCheryl V.

{{An Israeli security assessment has recommended devising contingency plans to attack Iran even if it means courting a conflict with the US.\nThe leaked paper drawn up by Israeli military chiefs maintains that Tel Aviv has a \u2018limited\u2019 window of opportunity to act against Iran before the country obtains a nuclear weapon, claiming that in 2009, Israel might have to face a nuclear Iran \u2018alone\u2019.\nSenior Israeli officials had earlier expressed concern that an Obama administration might lead up to the restoration of Washington-Tehran relations.\nPresident-elect Barack Obama has vowed to begin direct and unconditional talks with top Iranian officials on the country\u2019s long-disputed nuclear program.\nIsrael alleges that Iran, a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has plans \u2018to build a nuclear weapon\u2019.

{{Expand Villagers from Sang Gang, in Kachin State site of recent fighting, at a newly established internally displaced persons camp. \u00a9 2011 Human Rights Watch\n(New York) \u2013 Burma\u2019s armed forces have committed serious abuses against ethnic Kachin civilians in renewed fighting in Kachin State, Human Rights Watch said today. Since hostilities began over five months ago against the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Burmese armed forces have been responsible for killings and attacks on civilians, using forced labor, and pillaging villages, which has resulted in the displacement of an estimated 30,000 Kachin civilians.\nOn September 30, 2011, Burma\u2019s President Thein Sein suspended a controversial US$3.6 billion hydropower dam project on the Irrawaddy River in Kachin State, which appears to have been one of several factors in the renewed hostilities between the Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). The Chinese-financed project was suspended after growing dissent in Burma over its current and potential environmental and social impacts.\n\u201cRenewed fighting in Kachin State has meant renewed abuses by the Burmese army against Kachin villagers,\u201d said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cTens of thousands of people have fled through the mountains and jungle at the height of the rainy season, driven away by fear of army attacks.\u201d\nFighting between the Burmese army and the KIA, Burma\u2019s second largest ethnic armed group, began on June 9, ending 17 years of ceasefire. The Burmese army first attacked a strategic KIA post at the location of another Chinese-led hydropower dam on the Taping River in Momauk township, Human Rights Watch said. The army subsequently launched a major offensive and moved in hundreds of troops to areas formerly controlled by the KIA. There have since been failed ceasefire talks and an unconfirmed number of skirmishes, ambushes, and battles involving heavy mortar shelling. The KIA subsequently destroyed several road and railway bridges to frustrate the Burmese army\u2019s advance and supply lines. The KIA reportedly began conscripting able-bodied men and women aged 18 to 55 for a two-month military training, in anticipation of protracted fighting.\nHuman Rights Watch conducted a fact-finding mission to the conflict areas in Kachin State in July and August, visiting abandoned villages and eight remote camps of internally displaced persons. Witnesses described serious abuses committed by Burmese soldiers, including killings and attacks on civilians, pillaging of villages, and the unlawful use of forced labor.\nFearing abuses from the Burmese army, tens of thousands of Kachin fled their villages, Human Rights Watch said. Before arriving at displaced persons camps in KIA controlled areas, several thousand villagers hid from the Burmese army in the jungle, in some cases for a month after the fighting began. Those who were able to visit their homes to get provisions told Human Rights Watch that Burmese army soldiers had occupied their villages and confiscated their property and belongings. Some described being held by Burmese soldiers, who interrogated them harshly for information about the KIA, including by threatening to kill them. Interrogations were particularly menacing for villagers who spoke Kachin dialects and very little Burmese.\nHuman Rights Watch documented the killings of three Kachin civilians by Burmese soldiers in June and is investigating credible allegations of other killings. Villagers told Human Rights Watch that on June 15, Burmese army forces entered Hang Htak village in Man Je township searching for suspected associates of the KIA. A Burmese soldier shot and killed a 52-year-old woman and her 4-year-old grandson in their home at close range as they tried to flee. On June 17, credible local sources told Human Rights Watch that a group of soldiers allegedly shot and killed Nhkum Zau Bawk, a farmer and day laborer, in Kawng Gat Ban Ma village as he stood unarmed with a group of friends at a cemetery. Local authorities reportedly provided financial compensation to the man\u2019s family, but no legal action was taken against the perpetrator.\nAccording to the September 2011 report to the United Nations General Assembly by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Thomas Ojea Quintana, \u201cAllegations of abuses against civilian populations throughout Kachin State include reports of 18 women and girls having been gang-raped by army soldiers, and of four of those victims being subsequently killed.\u201d While Human Rights Watch did not speak to any victims or witnesses of rape, community members confirmed such abuses had occurred.\nSeveral people told Human Rights Watch that Burmese army soldiers fired on them as they were fleeing their village. For instance, in early June, Burmese soldiers twice fired on a 62-year-old Kachin woman and her three young grandchildren in Sang Gang village. She told Human Rights Watch, \u201cIn the morning when we were cooking rice, we heard gunfire and we left our food and went to the field, looking into the village the whole day before we fled. When we ran the soldiers shot at us. We were really afraid. We just ran and hid.\u201d She said that after two days in the jungle without basic provisions, they decided to return home to get food, at which point they were fired upon a second time. \u201cWe had already left the house and were on our way out of the village \u2026 and the soldiers opened fire on us [again],\u201d she said. \u201cNo one was hit. When the soldier opened fire it made me shake and I didn\u2019t know what to do. We just ran.\u201d\nUnder the laws of war applicable in conflict areas in Burma, all sides are prohibited from mistreating persons in their custody, targeting civilians, or pillaging homes and other civilian property.\nThe Burmese army has unlawfully used Kachin civilians for forced labor, which has long been a serious problem in Burma\u2019s ethnic areas, Human Rights Watch said. Five civilians told Human Rights Watch that in recent months they had been forced to work for the military without compensation; several others knew of family or friends who had had to do so. A 36-year-old mother of six children who fled Lusupa village, a government-controlled area, told Human Rights Watch how she and other Kachin villagers, including children as young as 14, had been commonly forced to porter for the Burmese army. She said that her husband, who remained in their village to tend their crops and check on their home and belongings, was forced to carry out labor for the army twice, in late June and mid-July.\nThe laws of war prohibit the use of uncompensated or abusive forced labor, including work in combat areas.\nMany Kachin recounted previous abuses at the hands of the Burmese army. A 58-year-old Kachin farmer, who said all his possessions had been taken by the Burmese army, told Human Rights Watch: \u201cWe lost our homes and properties to the Burmese soldiers several times. That is why I don\u2019t have hope in this situation.\u201d\nRecent abuses in Kachin State highlight the importance of establishing a United Nations commission of inquiry into alleged violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Burma, Human Rights Watch said. The UN special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, first called for a commission of inquiry in March 2010, and to date 16 countries have publically confirmed their support for the initiative, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and others, as well as Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\u201cPronouncements of political reform in Burma do not seem to have reached the army in Kachin State,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cOngoing abuses starkly demonstrate that until real steps are taken towards accountability, including an international commission of inquiry, minorities such as the Kachin will be at grave risk.\u201d\nBurmese Army Abuses in Kachin State: June 2011\nAttacks on Civilians, Forced Labor, and Mistreatment in Custody\nA 51-year-old Kachin farmer from Sang Gang told Human Rights Watch that a government soldier opened fire on him on June 12, despite it being clear he was unarmed: \u201cThe soldier and I were around 50 meters apart, and between us was a small stream. The soldier said nicely, \u2018Brother, come, come,\u2019 and I pretended to come and then suddenly ran, and the soldier shot at me two times. I hid for one hour near where I escaped. After one hour it was getting dark and I ran. I was afraid of the Burmese.\u201d\nA 48-year-old Kachin woman explained to Human Rights Watch how on June 13 the Burmese army opened fire into Kawng Ra Zup village, which sits in a valley below a mountaintop Burmese army post. \u201cThe Burmese soldiers shot their guns, so we were really afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they were aiming at. The village head said we should run, so we just ran.\u201d\nA 33-year-old woman told Human Rights Watch that before the current fighting she was forced to carry provisions up a two-mile road to a Burmese army outpost while she was six-months pregnant. She said, \u201cI had to do forced labor for the Burmese soldiers many times\u2026 [Before the fighting began] we carried rice and other things to [the Burmese army] post and walked back. It took three hours. The path is very steep, we had to climb the mountain and it was difficult to reach. From morning to evening we had to do it twice. The food we brought ourselves and we ate. They didn\u2019t feed us.\u201d\nA 48-year-old woman from Kawng Ra Zup said the Burmese army\u2019s previous use of forced labor and other ill-treatment was an important reason those in her village fled: \u201cEvery villager in our village had to work for the soldiers in the last year. And they hit our village head with their guns and they punched and kicked him. They knocked him out. From the road to the post we had to carry rice. We could not refuse to do the work. We weren\u2019t paid anything.\u201d\nA local Kachin carpenter who fled his village fearing attack from the Burmese army explained to Human Rights Watch how he had commonly been forced to work for the army. \u201cI am a carpenter and I know how to make cement and how to build houses,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the army needs a weapons store and flagpole and boundaries, they ask me to work on these things. Everything they need, they ask me, but they never pay me the full amount\u2026I cannot refuse to do this work. Sometimes they ask when I am very busy, but I have to do it.\u201d\nA villager from Sin Lum described fleeing to the jungle: \u201cWe were afraid to live in the village so we went to hide in the jungle one mile from the village. It was 11 households, 58 people. We lived there for a month ... and when we needed food and rice we secretly went back to the village and then came back. We lived [in the jungle] with plastic bags as shelter. When we were going back and forth secretly, the Burmese soldiers saw us and told us next time they saw us they were going to shoot us. After that, no one went back.\u201d\nA 60-year-old farmer from Sin Lum told Human Rights Watch said that before he fled he was interrogated and threatened on a daily basis by the Burmese army, suspicious of his family\u2019s ties to the KIA. Fearful for his security, he finally fled to a displaced persons camp on July 23. \u201cThe soldiers shot their guns four times to the ground and threatened me and asked, \u2018Where is your son? What is he doing?\u2019 I can\u2019t speak Burmese well. I just told them I didn\u2019t know.... The soldiers would come in the daytime. Everyday [in July] they came and asked me questions and interrogated me, sometimes once, sometimes twice.\u201d This farmer described how in the past the army had forced him to porter several times, repeatedly beating and mistreating him. He told Human Rights Watch that in the early 1990s a Burmese soldier cut his throat, leaving a large scar that left him permanently fearful of the army\u2019s return.\nA 30-year-old woman from Sin Lum told Human Rights Watch that she endured the same interrogation by the military every day for several weeks before she finally fled on July 15: \u201cEvery day the soldiers came and asked, \u2018Do you have a guest? Do you have a KIA soldier?\u2019 Every day they came and talked like that.\u2026We couldn\u2019t sleep at night, whether the soldiers came or not.\u2026 At our house, at least three soldiers per day came and checked and asked questions since the fighting started. They would ask many questions. This made us afraid.\u201d\nAnother villager told Human Rights Watch, \u201cI was very afraid when they [soldiers] came and asked questions. I was afraid they would kill us.\u201d\nProperty Confiscation and Destruction\nA 65-year-old Christian pastor who fled his village on June 10 told Human Rights Watch: \u201cThe soldiers took all of our belongings. They took 18 motorbikes, one rice mill, and all the buffalo, pigs, chickens, everything. Some people were going to build a house and the soldiers took all their materials. I don\u2019t know how many soldiers are there now, but when the fighting started there were 500 soldiers who came, and now they are living in the village. They are living in our houses.\u201d\nA 58-year-old woman who fled her home in Sang Gang was sobbing with despair when she told Human Rights Watch that her family had lost everything after the Burmese army entered her village on June 9: \u201cMy friends and I [secretly] returned to the house to give the pigs and chickens some food, and when we arrived all the houses [in the village] were messy and destroyed. We were very afraid and we wanted to take our food but we could not. Some villagers were in the jungle. We joined them \u2026 and then came here [a displaced persons\u2019 camp]. If we went to live in our village, we think we\u2019d be beaten or tortured by the [Burmese army] soldiers. There are many civilians in our village sympathetic to the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization], so if we went back and stayed we would be killed.\u201d\nIn mostly Buddhist Burma, the majority of Kachin are Christian. A 65-year-old Kachin villager from Sang Gang told Human Rights Watch that when the fighting started in June 2011 the Burmese army uprooted a large Christian cross from a hilltop regarded by the villagers as sacred, and used it as a stand for their weapons. The villagers had planned to eventually construct a church on the site. \u201cWe villagers made a large cross for the [proposed] church [on the hilltop],\u201d he said, \u201cand the Burmese soldiers took it out of the ground and used it to prop up their big machine guns.\u201d\nBackground\nThe renewed conflict in Kachin State is rooted in a long-standing political dispute and large-scale economic interests. In 1994, after decades of brutal fighting and widespread human rights abuses, the KIO and the Burmese military government signed a ceasefire agreement granting the KIO political autonomy over a Special Region in Kachin State, ending the fighting, and granting some latitude for the expansion of humanitarian assistance and development in the area.\nNearly every Kachin villager interviewed by Human Rights Watch described painful histories of forced labor, torture, killings, and other abuses by the Burmese army before and after the 1994 ceasefire. The Kachin, who are predominantly Christian in largely Buddhist Burma, also spoke of past instances of religious repression, which contributes to the collective fears of persecution and widespread feelings of ethnic and religious discrimination among displaced Kachin communities.\nA 36-year-old woman from Hka Ya village told Human Rights Watch she was first subject to forced labor in 1983, at age 8. When she fled to escape forced portering for the Burmese army, soldiers shot at her and her aunt: \u201cWhen I was 8 years old I had to carry things many times, and with the old people I secretly went and ran away into the forest, and when we ran the soldiers fired their guns at us....We didn\u2019t get hit.\u201d\nA 54-year-old farmer from Sin Lum said that since the 1970s he had been forced to porter for the Burmese army \u201caround 70 to 80 times, at least,\u201d and that he had \u201cwitnessed more than a hundred killings by Burmese soldiers. I can\u2019t even say how many. It\u2019s been so many.\u201d\nA 58-year-old Baptist Christian farmer from Maisakba told Human Rights Watch how on three occasions from 2000 to 2009 the Burmese authorities forbade his community from constructing a new Christian church, in part because the proposed structure was in the shape of a cross. \u201cThe Burmese authorities banned this construction project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to avoid the religious symbol, the cross.\u2026 All three times we were rejected.\u201d A 48-year-old Roman Catholic villager from Loimawkyang likewise explained how in 2000 his community was forbidden from constructing a new church.\nIn 2008, Burma\u2019s military government announced that all armed groups under ceasefire agreements would have to transform into Border Guard Forces under the direct control of the Burmese army, as stipulated in the 2008 Constitution. The KIO rejected the proposal.\nIn October 2010, the Burmese state-run media for the first time since 1994 referred to the KIA as \u201cinsurgents\u201d as opposed to a \u201cceasefire group\u201d. The Kachin were barred from registering political parties or independent candidates in Burma\u2019s November 2010 elections, pro-KIO candidates were removed from the ballots, and tens of thousands of Kachin in KIO-controlled areas were effectively barred from voting.\nOn June 9, 2011, the army entered and attacked KIA-controlled territory in Sang Gang and Bum Seng villages near the Taping #1 hydropower dam on the Taping River. The fully constructed Taping #1 dam is one of two proposed dams on the Taping River in Burma. It is a project led by China Datang Corporation in partnership with the Burmese Ministry of Electric Power. According to state-controlled media, the Burmese army\u2019s offensive was an effort to consolidate power in the area and provide security for the hydropower dam. The KIA denied that the dam was ever under threat.\nThe recently suspended Myitsone hydropower dam at the confluence of the Mali and N\u2019Mai rivers on the Irrawaddy in Kachin State also appears to have been a factor in the conflict. On March 16, 2011, the KIO sent a letter, a copy of which was obtained by Human Rights Watch, to Chinese President Hu Jintao requesting that the Chinese authorities stop construction of the Myitsone dam because of several social and environmental concerns. The letter specifically named China Power Investment and the Burmese company Asia World Co. Ltd. as investing parties. The KIO wrote that it had informed the Burmese government it would not be held responsible if civil war broke out because of the dam project. Less than three months later, war broke out.\nThe fighting in Kachin State coincides with an increase in fighting in neighboring Shan State, where the Burmese government also has several economic interests, including dual transnational oil and gas pipelines to China, which will pass through territory claimed by the KIA and the Shan State Army\u2013 areas populated by a mix of Kachin, Shan, Burmese, and ethnic Chinese.\n}}

{{CINCINNATI -- The trauma of human trafficking can take victims years to recover from, and the shame can drive them into silence instead of toward help. The National Human Trafficking Hotline received more than 1,000 calls from Ohio in 2016, but there could be many more.\nBhumika Patel, a regional specialist with the Salvation Army's anti-trafficking program, is just one of the local women who work to help trafficking victims find resources for support and recovery. The Salvation Army has helped 150 people in 2017, finding them through outreach and assisting them as they navigate the court system in search of justice.\nBut for many victims, the first stop isn't at a charity. It's a hospital.\n\"They'll end up here because it's gotten to the point that they're so sick,\" forensic nurse examiner coordinator Jenn Hall said.\nMost victims she sees through TriHealth's Center for Abuse and Rape Emergency Services -- CARES -- are malnourished and anxious to the point of not being able to make eye contact, she said. Hall has already treated 400 in 2017.\n\"The number is huge this year,\" she said, although that doesn't mean there are more cases -- just more people seeking help. \"It's definitely increasing over the last couple of years with everything that's happening in the media and all the people being accused of sexual assault.\"\nOnce a survivor makes it through the doors and receives treatment, medical staffers like Hall ask if they are safe to go home. If not, they connect them with shelter that is safe.\n\"They will stay in the emergency room for three days if there's a situation,\" Hall said. \"The doctors here and my team have worked together to make sure that happens. \u2026 We're also extra witnesses in court.\"\nIf you or someone you know has been a victim of human trafficking, you can contact the Salvation Army at 513-800-1863 or online.

{{Regarding the article ``Guatemalan Election Digs Deeper Roots for Democracy,'' Nov. 14: The vitiated candidates in the Guatemalan presidential elections have not only failed to challenge the power of the Guatemalan army and its terror tactics, but have also ignored the large-scale forced relocations of hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoples to reservations because powerful landowners desire more land for agricultural and mineral production - a policy which has continued unabated during the tenure of the outgoing civilian government. This policy promotes a disintegration of centuries-old communities, possible labor exploitation, and a military which regulates and controls the behavioral, political, and economic activity of residents. Matthew J. McGuire, Washington\nThe author states that the election in Guatemala was the first time in a century that one civilian government followed another without interruption by the military. Juan Jose Arrevalo, a civilian-elected president, turned over the Guatemalan government to Jacobo Arbenz, elected in 1952. Not until the CIA-sponsored revolt ousted Arbenz did the country enter the long period of military rule. R. Shaw, Waverly, Ohio\nThe author says, ``Guatemalans are proving democracy is possible here.'' He then acknowledges that the military is ``politically dominant.'' The media seems to promote a belief that voting qualifies a country for the esteemed characteristic of ``democracy.''\nYet, few believe that a country controlled by the military and their death squads, in which journalists have been asassinated, and the current president sits under the thumb of the military, is entitled to use that term. Karl W. Hess, Shaker Heights, Ohio\nDemilitarization in Asia The article ``US Aims to Fulfill `Balance Wheel' Role in Asian Security,'' Nov. 6, quotes Richard Solomon, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, who says that the US must preserve its military facilities and troops in Asia since it is the only ``stabilizer'' of the situation in that region.\nThis assertion runs counter to the the statements made by US Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Irkutsk last summer when they said they no longer considered themselves military adversaries in Europe or Asia and were determined to cooperate with other countries.\nThe Paris Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ushered in a new era of partnership on the European continent. The Soviet Union believes that the European experience might well be used in Asia. The establishment of a new world order requires demilitarization of all continents, including Asia.\nMr. Solomon may be guided by the old tactic of seeking parity with the Soviet Union on the land while maintaining superiority in the seas. This approach is a vestige of the era of confrontation.\nMoscow is not alone in its thinking. At a meeting of the Asian and Pacific Economic Council in Singapore, Canada and Australia recommended a conference on security and cooperation in Asia to initiate a process similar to the CSCE process.\nThe conditions for this are favorable. The Soviet Union has unilaterally cut its armed forces in the Asian regions of the country by 200,000 men and drastically scaled down their military capabilities. It will soon complete the withdrawal of its troops from Mongolia and is dismantling its military presence at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. The US is not the only ``stabilizer'' in Asia and the Pacific.

{{Army Reserve Command is expanding its search for talent and pinpointing which capabilities are needed for its ongoing Ready Force X effort for rapidly deploying units.\nLt. Gen. Charles Luckey, head of the Army Reserve, said the command has been taking a hard look at what units need to do, and how quickly they\u2019d need to do them.\n\u201cOver the last year, we have increased the fidelity on what types of capabilities need to be able to move quickly,\u201d Luckey told reporters at a Defense Writers Group breakfast in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.\nThe goal of Ready Force X, which Luckey announced in 2016, is to have formations ready to go in 90 days or less, depending on the contingency.\nMore than 600 units and 50,000 soldiers make up Ready Force X, but Luckey said he\u2019s not focused on the number of formations or troops.\nBy implementing Ready Force X, Luckey said he can see where the Reserve has potential risks, as well as its ability to quickly generate capabilities.\nFor example, if he identifies what the Reserve needs to do, and he knows which units are available to do that, he can assess the readiness of those units. If his assessment is that they\u2019re not sufficiently ready to do this five days from now, then he can address that.\n\u201cThat really helps me look at my formations and figure out, \u2018Okay, how do I fix that problem,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cOr, in some cases, how do I explain that with a high degree of fidelity to the senior leadership of the Army so that everybody understands this is the risk of trying to do this at this speed.\u201d\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

If a unit was alerted for a possible mobilization in 2019, those soldiers had several years to work their way through the training required to prepare for the mission.\nWith Ready Force X, soldiers must be prepared to mobilize in a much shorter timeframe.\nLuckey is also looking to see if the Reserve should be focusing on different areas for recruiting.\n\u201cI look at demographics in America, and I look at flow of human capital in the nation and where we need to move force structure to capture that talent,\u201d he said.\nOne of the Reserve\u2019s focuses is digital key terrain, or areas where there\u2019s a higher density of people who have a certain type of skill.\nThe high-tech industry is one of the places to look, he said.\nLuckey said the Reserve will be testing the waters in certain areas \u201cto capture talent that we may not have focused on before.\u201d\nSome of these areas include Silicon Valley in California; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; and North Carolina.\n}}

{{Allentown-based\nmembers this afternoon celebrated the 150th anniversary of the First Defenders, to which the soldiers trace their lineage.\nThe First Defenders were five companies of Pennsylvania militiamen first to arrive in the nation's capital, heeding President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the growing rebellion that led to the Civil War.\nThe companies, which included Allentown's Allen Infantry, arrived in Washington, D.C., on April 18, 1861. Today, members of the 213th Area Support Group gathered at the Allen Armory to remember the men and women that have come before them.\nCeremonies were attended by local dignitaries, former guardsmen and friends and family. A giant Sept. 11 memorial flag, created by the organization of upper Bucks County resident Thomas McBrien, acted as a backdrop for the celebration.\nMcBrien developed the idea days after the attacks and enlisted the help of more than 500 students, Boy Scouts and senior citizens in creating the flag. It consists of 2,993 smaller American flags stitched together as well as flags of the 86 nations that lost citizens in the attacks.\nThe flag also includes the names of the more than 3,000 victims of the terrorist attacks of\n. Members of the 213th will escort the flag to New York this week.\nThe unit honored members who have died, including Northampton native Sgt. Christopher Geiger. Geiger, a Civil War enthusiast, was 38 when he died of a heart attack in Afghanistan in 2003.\nThe day of his death, Geiger was assigned to escort young Afghan boys, a task he enjoyed because it allowed him to laugh and joke with the local children, said Col. Scott Wagner, who was Geiger's commander.\n\"The guy I remember had a huge smile,\" Wagner said.\nGeiger's family attended the ceremony and assisted in unveiling a plaque that will mark the armory's Geiger Room, a long-distance learning center for non-commissioned officers, said Lt. John O'Boyle, who grew up with Geiger.\nNormally, the Army only allows one soldier to accompany a body home. But Wagner said his unit insisted that two of Geiger's childhood friends would bring him home.\n\"The National Guard is a family,\" Wagner said.\nSpeakers also commemorated three Pennsylvania guardsmen killed in Afghanistan in July when a homemade bomb exploded as a transportation supply convoy passed. Killed were Sgt. Brian Mowery, 49, of Halifax, Sgt. Edward Koehler, 47, and Staff Sgt. Kenneth VanGiesen, 30, of McKean County.\nKoehler moved to Georgia after falling in love but still deployed with his friends in Pennsylvania, according to the Patriot-News. McKean wasn\u2019t part of the 131st Transportation Company, but he served with them during this deployment to fill out the company. It was his fourth combat tour.\nWagner said it is one thing to raise your hand and swear to defend the Constitution, but it's another to put on a uniform and another to go into harm's way. But that's what guard members do, he said.\n}}

(Army)\n\u2018The big, green Army machine\u2019\nLast year, when the Army rolled out its Distributed Leader Course, the replacement for the much maligned Structured Self-Development, TRADOC also created a list of six leader core competencies as a reference touchstone through an NCO\u2019s development.\nThey include readiness, leadership, training management, Army and joint operations, program management, and communications, and those concepts are threaded through the DLC. The idea is that NCOs will keep them in mind, or refer back to them, as their careers develop, and they will be evaluated on them as they move through the promotion system.\nBut building outstanding enlisted leaders will take more than a few tweaks to education. A recent Rand Corp. study found a relationship between time in service and effectiveness as an E-9 \u2015 that is to say, that sergeants major with less than 22 years in service had soldiers with slightly higher attrition rates than those with more experience.\nGuden read the study, he said, and immediately identified the kind of fast-burner who might run into trouble because of quick promotions during the Global War on Terror, when the Army needed to crank out squad and team leaders for troops in battle.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a really bad habit of doing this \u2014 for the right reasons, mind you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big, green Army machine needed more, and we just kept feeding it and feeding it. And I guess now we\u2019re having to deal with some of those things.\u201d\nOne possible issue, the study identified, is that Army doctrine does not emphasize cultivating specific leadership traits until a soldier is eyeing a platoon sergeant job. Before that, mastery of soldier tasks and physical fitness count for the preponderance of promotion consideration.\nFrom specialists to sergeants major, the Army is overhauling its education system From professional military education to the transition back to civilian life, the Army is trying to grow better leaders and give soldiers tools to translate their knowledge into civilian education.\nA lot of that has to do with the churn of deployments and permanent changes of station, Guden offered. Many platoon sergeants only spend 18 months in their positions \u2015 but it can take about a year to get your bearing in a new unit while balancing operational demands, and by then, you have just months to make a lasting impact.\n\u201cIf your first year is on a deployment, and then you get back to Fort Wherever \u2026 once you start applying yourself, it\u2019s six months and, bam, you\u2019re out of there,\u201d Guden said. \u201cAre we giving NCOs enough time to really grow and bloom?\u201d\nThe Rand study suggested finding a way to identify and single out young, potential leaders who show a knack for empathy, organization and other traits they\u2019ll be able to capitalize on further down the road.\n\u201cI think about that a lot. I don\u2019t know what the answer to that is,\u201d Guden said. \u201cBut I can tell you the one thing that I do know is that if a sergeant, who\u2019s in his first leadership position \u2014 in my mind, that\u2019s an NCO\u2019s time to learn and grow and make their mistakes, maybe even bad mistakes.\"\n}}

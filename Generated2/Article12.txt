Title : NBC skiing analyst cites female Olympic skiers’ makeup

Original :
The intent of the report from NBC skiing analyst Steve Porino during today’s women’s downhill competition was noble. He stood out on the mountain to convey to NBC viewers just how steep and treacherous is the course for this exciting competition. With the help of some nifty graphics from NBC, Porino spoke of the course’s so-called “Forest Drop,” a part of the mountain that the skiers enter at 60 mph. It has a 70 percent grade, twice the pitch of “your roof,” Porino said. In the space of nine seconds, he continued, these extraordinary female athletes descend the height of the Washington Monument, all while making turns. Altogether, they barrel ahead at three G forces, which is like “having an offensive lineman on your back.”
Now it was time for the little segment’s kicker, which Porino handled like this: “All of that while in a Lycra suit, maybe a little bit of makeup — now that is grace under pressure.”
Perhaps, but it’s not good broadcasting under any circumstances. Though Porino did a great job of explaining the physics of the downhill run, why the merely tangential mention of makeup? Isn’t it cosmetic products that define these incredibly talented women, anyhow?
Twitter was merciless toward Porino’s alpine stereotyping:
A Lycra suit & “a little bit of makeup”?! Are you kidding me?! Flying down a mountain at 60+MPH & this guy mentions makeup?! #Olympics2014 — Melissa (@melissarochelle) February 13, 2014

Alissa Miller, an NBC Olympics analyst and co-host of Meet the Press and Larry King World , was asked to give an example of women who’ve skied with a beige tuxedo, said she was about to do a little skiing.
“Maybe next time you turn around and say ‘Hey, old friend, this is my date today,'” Miller said. “Hopefully you’re watching the TV anyway.”
Miller, of Fido’s Kenmare, N.J., notes that while hockey players have notoriously racist words in their locker-room locker rooms, some female athletes are also pretty much overrepresented.
“And it’s not even un-feminist,” Miller said. “It’s considered ‘unfeminist’ a lot less often.”
Last year, Miller shared details about a 2003 incident when her fellow ski skier Anton Bejarano, a Canadian, gave her his helmet during a gauntlet run in the Men’s ski-cross.
In her episode, Miller told Bejarano, “you should never go like that,” and also explained that some people and exercise fans are like fleas to skiers: they were covered in blood for no real reason.
“Honestly, my first thought when I heard about the helmet incident was, ‘Oh my God,’ ” Miller said. “And I thought, ‘No, it must be color fit.’ And I was like, ‘I bet she wears a tuxedo and a bow tie.'”
Miller, 31, has devoted most of her career to what she calls her “patsy reputation,” but before her appearance on Meet the Press last summer, she hit another milestone: She earned her first Pro Women’s World Cup title. Miller will be at the Sochi Olympics next month.

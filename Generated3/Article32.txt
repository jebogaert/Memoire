Title : E-Learning in European Higher Education Institutions

Original :
The present study on e-learning intends to contribute to closing a data gap and to stimulate the discussion on the further development of national and European policies on the issue and to supportits systematic institutional take-up. It draws upon a survey conducted by the European University Association between October and December 2013.
249 answers from higher education institutions, in their majority universities, from 38 European systems (EU and wider Europe), were received. While the sample is self-selected, it represents almost one third of EUAâ€™s institutional membership. The survey asked about the type of e-learning institutions use, their experiences in this area and their expectations for the future. It considered blended and online learning in various formats.
Given the strong interest in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a large section of the report is dedicated to this issue. The survey also posed questions regarding support structures and services, intra-institutional coordination, quality assurance and recognition.

The University of Strasbourg and the Eco-Human Service Home have also become an important source of specialist knowledge to the University of Strasbourg, and consequently, have become a major source of training opportunities for current and future French students and their parents.
Universities are a vital part of a booming French economy in the Global South, offering direct access to expertise and new curricula from the global upswing of digital learning technologies. For all these reasons, the E-Learning Institutions in Europe partnership has become one of the most highly-valuable and popular in Europe, and the quality of their services in this is impressive, even during difficult times for the state education system.

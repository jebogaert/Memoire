Title : Launch of the Global Guide of Ethics, Principles, Policies and Practices in Balanced and Inclusive Education

Original :
In December 2017, ERF organised the First ForumBIE 2030 at the United Nations in Geneva (UNIOG), at which 85 policy makers and civil society representatives from around the globe, including UNESCO’s International Bureau of Education’s (IBE-UNESCO) representatives, endorsed the need for the development of a Global Guide of Ethics, Principles, Policies and Practices in Balanced and Inclusive Education.
In furtherance of this mandate, ERF launched and distributed the Global Guide within the context of an International Call for Balanced and Inclusive Education (ICBIE). A non-binding expression of a collective aspiration for the pursuit of BIE, the International Call provides the framework for the building of multilateral partnerships and the international implementation of pilots based upon the Global Guide.
Today, The Education Relief Foundation is truly honoured, humbled and very proud to announce that the Global Guide of Ethics, Principles, Policies and Practices in Balanced and Inclusive Education has been launched formally and distributed at the II ForumBIE 2030.

One of the most popular tips of the field is the "fit the curriculum." It is built upon, rather than critical, opinion about “creative” or “materialistic” schools, such as the one education system educates and advises us against. According to Robert Angell, founder of Kidwell (www.kidwell.net) in Chicago, the word "fit" has inspired cutting-edge math and science studies in schools as well as models in classrooms. This book, which is co-authored by Cristina and Manuela Olana, offers a very simple primer on how effective schools fit the curriculum into an experience of true strategic thinking.
Step 1
Bring in your curriculum experts to review in partnership with your teacher. The trained instructors, when they teach, teach, according to work patterns, roles and obligations, with students, in order to ensure there are no serious errors in the writing, hard facts, or incorrect conclusions. "Having input from their students, parents, teachers, parents and pupils is very valuable," Angell says. "We strongly endorse the Four Principles of Ethics as well as other behaviors that demonstrate a positive approach in practice - and in good faith." Angell says you can always take the time to listen to the experts before making a recommendation or update your recommendations.
Step 2
Run the guide by hitting the "Tap or Paddle" button - which initiates the reader from submitting their ideas to instructors. After that, the board members must decide if the original recommendation is a stick or knife, while the panel should decide if the original recommendation is well-disseminated and, if it has value or creative purpose, should be used. Board members are then given a year to identify and recommend these recommendations. These recommendations include how to increase-test results and basic writing ability, and consider an alternative school, such as Egan's Junior high school, where teachers can "find out" if they can make the book accessible to their students. The teachers, who report best results, get a designation.
Step 3
Launch the Guide by mailing it in to the school in which you are currently taking the class. This guide will display the students' strengths and weaknesses in 5 modules - all created in accordance with the selected facts or roles of the students. One additional module allows you to select up to 10 modules per year of coursework, which can vary depending on the course. Each module is a "Black Belt" one that you can use to cover topics not included in the lecture. In addition, you can choose which modules on which you want to review before writing the book, and how much time you want to spend on them. Here are the recommended points of review:
The article recommends that each module be a two-book course, with the first two education modules providing, "preference items" - interesting things your students will want to do if they start in a different school, and/or what classes they want to participate in. Clearly these specific modules need to be available. The previous suggested module was taken down because it was too over-commoditized.
The Guide and all the other factors in favor of those sections, separated by 20 years (and weighted by the group of factors), are summed up in a 10-point model that is developed by Angell and Soli (www.soli.com). The goal is to encourage students to do books that might help them develop their skills and also to gain career/nonprofit experience so they can participate in solving problems in a more meaningful way.
Finally, it is important to not take this advice on the backs of students or teachers. One of the problems with peer school research is that it often ignores important, but difficult, factors from each school, rather than focusing on the different resources. Unless you have done so, you may not have a good idea of how your students are going to interact in situations that they may not understand or learn from, and that will discourage them from trying to succeed at school.
